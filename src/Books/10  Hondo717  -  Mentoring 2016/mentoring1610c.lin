^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a rule of 20 opener. When I have 10 HCP I sometimes choose not to open 1, depending on my hand. But with both majors I like opening 1@H with the East hand.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When I say I don't open 1, I do open, but sometimes I open a weak 2 even with a rule of 20 hand. All depends on my major suit holdings and the quality of my points (if short I want to make it harder for the opps to bid). With a hand with lots of queens and jacks I am more apt to open a weak 2. Otherwise, I open one of majors.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And I rarely open a 9 HCP hand at the 1-level even if it technically meets the rule of 20. In general I encourage you to open all hands that meet the rule of 20.|

Letting them play at the 2-level is rarely going to be a good result. Personally I would have doubled with the North hand. But as I said pass is certainly reasonable and what I suspect most players would have done.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out it was possible to make 3. West lost an extra spade.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The way I recommend to play the hand is to lead a low heart towards the @HQ at trick 2 try to set up dummy's hearts. If I have the @HK, then the hand is going to be easy. All that will be lost is a diamond a heart, and 2 spades probably.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Leading the @HQ is what I call a "practice finesse" which means even if the finesse wins, it doesn't do you much good. In general, when you have a suit missing the K and J with the queen in one hand and the ace in the other the best play is to lead low towards the queen.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is a finesse in that you are hoping the king is in front of the king so you can take 2 tricks. Leading the queen when you are missing both the K and J will never gain you a trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am now going to discuss the "gambling 3NT" which some people play.
|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/gamblng_3_no_trump.html^*N|CP||
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is sort of a way to get to play 3NT on some hands and preempt at the same time. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play "gambling 3NT" you would open 3NT under the following conditions:
^CYou have a 7 or 8 card minor headed by the AKQ;
^CYou have no outside aces or kings.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner has stoppers in the other 3 suits, they leave it in. Otherwise, they bid 4@C and opener passes or corrects to 4@D.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, on this hand if I open 3N, partner does have stoppers in the other suits and should pass assuming the opponents don't bid something.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is an interesting convention although admittedly it doesn't come up much.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a good illustration of a successful gambling 3N. Happened to work out well on this hand. Granted, they might have been able to take 4 diamonds and a heart on a bad day.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As I said, it hardly comes up but it can work out very well. And at the very least, partner has a great idea of what your hand is and can bid very accurately.|

And you lose 1 heart, 2 spades, 1 club and 1 diamond for down 2. North might not even double. So 4@H would not be unreasonable at all.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would lead a club here also although as you can see it is not a good lead as it turns out. However, let me discuss the following "negative" inference.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A negative inference is a conclusion you draw because partner did NOT bid something rather than bid something. Let's say (on a different hand) North had A10xx in both clubs and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general, it's a pure guess as to what to lead. However, on this particular auction, I had the opportunity to make a lead directing double of 2@C and I did not.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That doesn't mean that a club is still not the best lead. However, a diamond is slightly better because I did not double 2@C. On this hand, with much better clubs than diamonds, a club is what I would choose. But with Axxx in diamonds I would lead a diamond.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure that hand can ever be made. However, playing a diamond to the jack is not the way to go. It can't accomplish anything. West is going to take 2 diamond tricks no matter what unless I lead a diamond.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's see how West can plan the hand out. The top tricks are:
1 spade and 2 diamonds. Clubs are not breaking based on the lead. So West can count 2 club tricks, up to 5 total tricks.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Where can West get 4 more? Can only set up 1 spade and 1 heart. Might be able to get another heart if they are 3-3. That's 8. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In any case I suspect many players would end up down 2. It's a very hard and unfriendly hand.|

I could have bid 3@S, but given there was a preempt on my right East has around 7 or 8 points and I have 19. That leaves 13 or so between the other 2 hands. So on average pard will have 6 or 7 points. Therefore we should be close to making game.|

So I would lead the @CA quickly (if playing at the table) and then a low club. If West hesitated I would play the @CQ. If West played low quickly I am not sure what I would do. But I might or might not play the 9.|

One chance is to lead towards the @DK, hoping that West holds the @DA. Is that likely, do you think? Is there any other way to play the contract?|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We did all we could. We just don't have enough steam to bid again after East's 3@H bid, so they win the contract.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Before we talk about our sterling defense, let's look at it from the declarer's point of view. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The declarer has six Heart tricks and four Club tricks, which gives him his contract the minute he gets on lead. We can't let that happen. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Eddie Kantar teaches us to ask ourselves how the declarer is going to use the dummy to help us design a defense strategy. Looking at this dummy we, as South, see the Clubs as the place for declarer to dump losers. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With a "dump" dummy, we need an aggressive strategy. There's no profit in laying (lying?) back, waiting. We gotta come out with fists flying. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We can see three tricks and know Pard doesn't have too much for us. We wonder if our @DA 10 x can help produce the setting trick. If pard has one Diamond honor, it can happen. |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At trick 1, we figure Pard for the @SQ rather than a doubleton. |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At trick 2, we want him to lead a Diamond, and we tell him that by playing a high Spade, calling for the higher of the available suits--Clubs and Diamonds.(Is called "suit preference")|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2  
At trick 3, Pard fires back the @DQ, thusly trapping the poor, sad declarer's @DK. We end up taking two Spades and two Diamonds.|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Every single card the defenders play should have meaning. That's how you set contracts. Got that? (And all Boot Campers say "Amen.") |

pg| ***** 195 ***** |


PC|d2d5|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Before you decide what to play at trick 1, let's pause, think and plan the defense.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is clear that partner has led from a four card diamond suit, and now you have to decide which of the @DQ or @D9 to play to this trick.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
However, let me challenge you for a minute. Let's switch focus for a second or two. Based on the opening lead and the auction, what do you think partner's distribution is? Subsequently, what is declarer's distribution?|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Not sure? Getting dizzy? No worries - here is a hint.|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Partner is unlikely to have five hearts (he would lean towards a 1@H overcall); also, why would partner have led a diamond from a four-card suit if he had a five card heart suit?|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Declarer is very unlikely to have five hearts (West did not open 1@H).|NT||lb|*ySo are the missing hearts split 4-4?^^Y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|The hearts are surely split 4-4 between partner and declarer. Secondly, we know that partner has four diamonds (based on the opening lead), and his shape, therefore, is ? SPADES - FOUR HEARTS - FOUR DIAMONDS - ? CLUBS.|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT||lb|*yCan partner have four spades and a singleton club, i.e. a 4-4-4-1 shape?^^N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|No, if that were the case declarer would have a 1-4-2-6 shape and that would be a very bizarre way of bidding his hand!|
pg| ***** 204 ***** |


NT||lb|*yCan partner be 2S-4H-4D-3C?^^N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Not really; making a take-out double with only a doubleton spade is a big no-no.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Therefore, we can conclude that partner's hand distribution surely must be 3 SPADES - 4 HEARTS - 4 DIAMONDS - 2 CLUBS, giving declarer a shape of 2S-4H-2D-5C.|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Woah, did we just work out all of this information before we had even played a card? Fun, eh?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|With not much else to go on, you might as well play back a small diamond to set up the suit. It's best to retain the @DQ for later purposes, such as an entry to our hand to play a heart through if necessary.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
West's rebid is a little bit interesting. There are two reasonable options. One is a 1NT rebid, second is a 2@C rebid. Both options have its pros and cons. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1NT rebid gets the 'overall distribution' across, and it immediately limits the hand whereas a 2@C rebid with a good five card suit might do better since West does not have a diamond stopper, which could be important if there is a No-trump game on as he would want his partner to declare, not the hand with the two small diamonds.|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Before playing a single card to the first trick, you should always get into the habit of stopping and think about the entire hand. Not only would you practice your train of thought (which would only process faster and faster with more practice), but it prepares you for the play later on.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here on this deal, you could in fact picture everyone's distribution after the opening lead and as a result, you can almost defend double-dummy. And I'm sure you would agree with me that it would make you a more formidable opponent! |
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So how can you work out everyone's distribution? Well, the opening lead and the auction provide the telling clues. |
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We know that the hearts are 4-4 amongst partner and declarer since either one of them would have overcalled/opened or - in the case of North, led - hearts with five of them.|
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Secondly, we know that partner has four diamonds based on the opening lead. Thus, we have worked out so far that partner is therefore x-4-4-x.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Can partner have four spades and a singleton club, i.e. a 4-4-4-1 shape? |
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^B@2
No, else that would give declarer a 1-4-2-6 shape and that would be very bizarre based on the auction provided! |
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Can partner be 2-4-4-3? 
No, making a take-out double with only a doubleton spade would be a poor effort. Therefore we can deduce that partner's hand distribution must be 3-4-4-2, thus giving declarer a shape of 2-4-2-5.|
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Woah! That feels like magic! 
You can now defend this hand accordingly based on that information. So, declarer calls for a low diamond, which diamond should you play?|
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The @D9 is the correct card to play. 

If partner has led away from @D10 x x x (giving declarer @DK x), then playing the queen will set up dummy's jack. |
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner has led away from @DK x x x (giving declarer @D10 x), then it doesn't matter what we play as declarer will always be able to get two tricks after the small diamond lead. |
PG| ***** 247 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Finally, if partner has led away from @DK 10 x x (giving declarer @Dx x), then if we play the queen, partner's @DK will be exposed to a finesse. |
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, the @D9 is the one that you want. When this holds, you then return your smallest diamond to set up that suit. You definitely should not return the @DQ since you will probably need that card later as an entry for the later play. |
PG| ***** 249 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer then rattles off five clubs as your partner discards a heart and two spades, as you discard a spade and a heart.|
PG| ***** 250 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer now exits with a small spade to partner's now-blank ace and he returns a diamond to your @DQ. |
PG| ***** 251 ***** |


NT|^B@2
No doubt you will now play a heart honor through declarer, as you soon collect the desperately needed seven tricks. |
PG| ***** 252 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Did you hear right? Yes, all of that work for a measly little +50! Harsh, yes, but very satisfying indeed. |
