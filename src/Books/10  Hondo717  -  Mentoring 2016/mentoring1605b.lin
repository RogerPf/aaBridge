^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret should not like them playing 2@S. but she has no good bid and neither do I. Normally the person with shorter length in the opps suit should balance, but I have no good bid. With better clubs I might try 3@C and some players in Match Points might bid 3@H with Margaret's hand.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret's comment about not being able to respond to my overcall, having only 4 HCP, is not really relevant here. Let me explain why. In a balancing situation, which this is, the points are approximately evenly spread out/ So even though Margaret has fewer points, if she decides to balance she is bidding on the partnership assets, not just what is in her hand.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, it is better if she is weaker than stronger. I know that sounds odd, but since the points are approximately even between the 2 hands, if she is weaker that means I must be stronger. And that is good for our side, because I have the strong hand behind the stronger opponent's hand (the one who opened). That means more of our finesses are going to work.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bottom line is, balancing is done based on partnership assets, not just what you have in your hand. If they stop at the 2-level with a known 8-card fit, you are pretty sure the points are evenly spread, and you don't rate to get a good result if you let them play there.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
migalsal: Can West bid 1@S with only 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sure. What might be confusing is if the auction started 1@C-1@H, then West has a way to show how many spades he has. 1@C-1@H-dbl shows exactly 4 spades, whereas 1@C-1@H-1@S shows 5+ spades (usually 5). However, on the auction 1@C-1@D, as this auction, with a 4-card major responder should bid it (assuming they have at least 6 points).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret is much too strong for a weak jump shift. Most people play a weak jump shift shows no more than 4 HCP. Some people do play it shows a weak 2. But even if you play it shows a weak 2, we have a known club fit. So Margaret's hand is much stronger than its HCP indicate and therefore should not bid 2@S even if it promised 6-8 HCP.|

mb|1S|mb|2h|NT||lb|*bYour bid for East please.^^2s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H is not the best choice. First, and most importantly, East has 4-card support, and 2@H only shows 3-card support. And 2nd, on this hand, East's hand is now worth a lot more - 14 Dummy Points11 (HCP + 3 points for the singleton with 4 card support).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There happen to be 2 cue bids available for East to show the limit raise which doesn't happen very often. When that does happen, if you want to have an agreement between what does 2@C mean vs 2@S.  You could agree cuebid of the lower suit 2@C in this case shows a limit raise with 3-card support, whereas the higher suit (2@S) shows 4-card support.|ub||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North have a great hand. Particularly they bid the suits you are short in, so you have a great hand. The choices are 3@S, 4@C, 4@S, and 5@C. I did not double 2@S bid by East so I don't have spades. If I have as little as 2 small or even a singleton J or K, 4@S could have plays. So bidding 4@S with Margaret's hand is a bit risky.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@C is the most conservative bid, and very reasonable. But given the choice between 4@C and 5@C I probably choose 5@C and let the opponents guess what to do. Highly distributional hands take lots of tricks.|mb|5C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, North might also bid 3@S rather than 2@S. In that case I would have bid 4@S. North has a self sufficient spade suit and better than a simple double and correct. He is between 2@S and 3@S. I don't think 2@S is wrong, but you are 3 or 4 points better than you have to be.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, if north bids 3@S I bid 4@S and that is an iffy contract although on the auction it is a reasonable contract because one of the red suit finesses rates to work. In fact, it is probably cold.|

2 level bids by advancer (me here) are weak, less than 10. So 2@C (or 2@H or 2@S) by me would be less than 10 points. Some less experienced players think 2@C by me shows 10+ points. That is incorrect. I would redouble with clubs and 10+.|

They play 1@H or 1@S by me is forcing just as if East had passed. 1@H or 1@S can be done with a weak hand (6-9) but it also can be done with a strong hand. However, I play that any bid other than redouble or 2N denies 10 points.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I bid 1@H or 1@S that is at most 9 and is not forcing. The reason I recommend that is it is less confusing. I think it is very counter intuitive that 1@H or 1@S by responder is potentially stronger than 2@C by responder. However, as I said most play that 1@H or 1@S, although they can and often are weak, can be stronger and are forcing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain why East should lead back a low heart. It has to do with imagining yourself as declarer. From the lead East knows that declarer has the @HQ based on the lead, but declarer does not know who has the @HA. We assume West is not playing coded 10s and 9s in which case the J denies anything higher. On the other hand, if playing standard leads, from AJ10 West would lead the J.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying I would duck if East played back the @H9 but I sure would think about it. By playing the A, the suit is now clarified for me.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT|^B@2
intempo:  Even better to play @HA first trick, more confusing for declarer.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, playing the A would confuse declarer, but it would also confuse partner. In general my philosophy is don't confuse partner unless it makes no difference. Some people love to false card. I have one partner who does that, but it often causes me to misdefend.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should Margaret lead the @H6 instead of the @HJ?|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT| When in a suit contract, leading top of a 2 card sequence is fine because in most side suits, they are not likely to last more than 2 rounds before they are trumped. In NT you don't have to worry about a suit getting trumped so you want to set up your lower honors. Therefore normally you only lead the top of a 3-card sequence or broken sequence. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, assuming you are not leading partner's suit, you lead the J only if you have J109 or J108. Therefore, Margaret's technically correct lead is the @H6 which also might cause me to misguess the hearts. BTW, it also turns out I can make 6@D on a cross ruff, taking 2 spades, 2 clubs, and 8 trump tricks. But it is very hard to bid with only 28 HCP.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is NOT forcing and normally with 7 HCP West should pass 3@H. However, an ace and a king are the best 7 HCP you can have. In IMPs, you push to bid vul games. Therefore I like 4@H better than passing, although passing could be the winning bid, If not vul, I definitely pass with the West hand.|

^B@2^r@3^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Today, I'm going to share with you three of the most important lessons in bridge you will ever learn.|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

Lesson ##1. Bridge is a game of TRICKS, not points. We work so hard to memorize what bids we are allowed to make with what point count. We use our fingers, our toes, our nose, but often we forget that there is so much more to a hand than the points. PLUS! We tend to forget that we're only seeing half of our hand, anyway. The other half is sitting across the table. Next hand is the perfect example of this lesson. Between Pard and us, we've only got 24 HCP (High Card Points) but we're going to bid (and make) a grand slam.|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|

Lesson ##2. No five-card suit in dummy should ever be ignored. Repeat at least twice. When you find yourself in terrible trouble with little hope of salvation, don't give up if there's a five-card suit in dummy, no matter how moth-eaten it is. If you master and memorize this tip, you'll often get yourself out of trouble – when you don't deserve it. Again, today's hand is a great example. We will use our pathetic five-card dummy suit and prevail.|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

Lesson ##3. The crazier your Pard is acting/bidding, the nicer you have to be to him/her. Why? When you run over him in the parking lot and the police arrive, everyone will say, "Oh, his Pard couldn't have done it on purpose! They were getting along so well." It will go down as an accident, rather than the pre-meditated murder it was. Again, today's hand shows the wisdom of this. No thanks to Pard, we're going to make this contract, one way or another.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We're not sure what Pard was thinking when he put us in a Grand Slam, but you can bet we'll be the only pair in it, and making! |
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Pard's search for slam begins with a cuebid of his lowest first-round control. At least he knows he can't use Blackwood unless he's got first - or second - round control of all four suits in his hand. |
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We show our first-round Diamond control, and then with another puff of whatever he is smoking, he puts us in a 24 pt. Grand Slam. We have only one loser, a Club, and it seems unsurmountable until we remember that "No five-card suit in dummy should ever be ignored." Hmmm. We've got lots of entries and it's our only chance, so we go for it. |
