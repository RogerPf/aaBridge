UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding:
2@C is a tad aggressive. You can overcall at the 1 level with even a mediocre 5 card suit and 8+ points, but at the 2 level, you prefer to have 10 points, and a 6-card suit or a nice 5-card suit (quality suit or at least lots of intermediate cards). |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has the points, but the club suit is a bit weak. Having said that, one of my favorite overcalls is 2@C over 1@D. It makes it harder, as in this case, for the opps to find their major suit fit. So I don't fault 2@C too much. It could work out really well.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North is too weak to do anything but a negative double. Pass is not good with the 5-5 and singleton club. Over 3@C there is another problem. It is likely we have an 8-card fit somewhere, but which suit.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If I bid again, I would bid spades, figuring with such weak hearts, spades has got to play better more often than not, but I don't fault pass. Note that if North bids 3@S, that is not strong. North did not bid 2@S over 2@C. therefore North cannot have that good a hand.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Play:
West should cover the @DJ. Forcing out 2 honors with 1 honor is always good. Also, I led back a low diamond for North to ruff (the @D2). Whenever you lead back a suit to ruff, you give suit preference. So my low diamond said I wanted the lower of the 2 remaining suits--spades and hearts. I wanted a heart back. And even if there were no suit preference that is probably the safer lead.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the spade that did come back, West should play low. 2nd hand low is not only good on defense, it is also often good on offense. In this case, if West plays low, a 2nd spade trick is guaranteed. If I played the K or Q, the J would force out the other honor and the 10 would be good. As it turns out my 9 was doubleton so it did not matter, but it could have.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also notice I did not cover the first high club. In general you cover the last honor in dummy when covering an honor with an honor. On this hand it did not matter because I always have a natural club trick with my Q9x, but on some hands it does matter.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should assume I have a 6-card suit because that is what 2@S shows. So by the Law of Total Tricks, with 9 trump, we have a 9-card fit. But 4-3-3-3 is bad distribution and we are vul and they are not.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But once you pass you should live with that decision and not bid 3@S over 3@D. If you intended to bid 3@S over their contract, then bid it right away. It is always better to make your bids earlier rather than later. you don't want to give the opps a chance to communicate at a lower level. Make them guess.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North should decide whether or not she is willing to play in 3@S. If yes, then bid it right away. If no, then keep passing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By bidding 3@S North can assume I will think she has 3 spades though it is not 100% clear how many spades North has. Therefore, North should lead attitude (the 9) not count. Had North not supported spades, the 2 is right. Normally I would have given an undo, but didn't because of the BBO bug.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't hate playing a spade here, as it strips the suit, but it is not necessary to ruff spades right away. In general, there is no reason to ruff in the long hand. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West is going to take 5 diamond tricks, whether by ruffing spades or leading diamonds. So there is no tricks gained by ruffing spades. And it has the disadvantage of shortening trump. So I would just lead diamonds at this point.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has a tough call over 2@S (which is one of the reasons why I bid it). I assume East/West do not play Lebensohl and I recommend against playing Lbensohl because it is very complicated and easy to mess up.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would probably either bid 3@D with the West hand. Not sure if that should be forcing. Or 3@S is another possibility (which is Stayman). I personally like 3@D as that is more flexible. It gives partner a chance to pass, bid 3@H, or bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this case, had West bid 3@D I (East) would have bid 3N. And that has plays, if I am smart enough to start with a spade and shift to a heart, 3N goes down. But if I start with the @SK, and make the "safe" exit of a club, it makes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned, if you duck 2 spades, since North has both aces, you will make 3N always. Even if I start with the @SK and shift to a heart. So long as you duck 2 spades, you lose 2 spades, 1 heart and 1 diamond and take 9 tricks.|

 So I have a clear 4@H bid.|mb|4H|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 Note that some people think 4@H is a "shut out" bid. That is definitely not true. It simply shows 20+ points and 4 hearts with no singleton or void because I would splinter with shortness. If North had a little better hand, North might think about slam and should be worried even with the hand she has that slam might make.|

It is close. I like the bid. 3@H shows 17-19 when you use Bergen Points--15 HCP, 1 length point and 3 points for the singleton with 4 trump = 19. But a few timid players might only bid 2@H. They still probably get to 4 because I think West has enough to invite (unless West is also timid :) :).|

bt||qx|VB,Hands of the Week from Vu-Bridge|
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|On a recent visit to France I was inveigled into playing a session of duplicate pairs in a posh Paris club with the inventor of VuBridge. When we turned we discovered that the event wasn't just a standard 24-board duplicate but a simultaneous pairs event. The French do things differently - in this event (we found out half way through the movement) eight of the boards had been "rigged" by experts as declarer-play problems. Thanks for telling us, guys!|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


AT|

I had already struggled with the first few boards. My first hand consisted of an assortment of 1s, Rs, Vs and Ds. Qu'est-ce que c'est? No English cards in Paris, oh no! Aces were 1s, Kings were Rs (for Roi) Queens were Ds (a Queen is a Reine in French but having two Rs would confuse even the French so they call it a Dame or lady) and Jacks were Vs (for Valet - think "varlet").|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

The printouts at the end of the tournament were a scream (to English eyes, anyway). Tens were depicted as "X". Ten in French (as I'm sure you know) is "Dix" but they couldn't write "D" for obvious reason. So they use "X" – the Roman numeral. So, f'rinstance, how would you bid

@S R V X
@H X 9 6 5
@D R D X 
@C R V 5|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


AT|

Nope, me neither ...

Still, despite me having to look carefully at the pictures on the cards so that I didn't attempt to take a King with a Queen (sorry - a Roi with a Dame) we actually won the event, at least – we won the local heat.

The hand in this section represent a declarer-play deal that were put in by French experts to see if you could maximize your Matchpoints by playing them correctly.

Bear in mind that this is a Matchpoint pairs event where overtricks matter!|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Whether you bid 3@S or 4@S on the South hand after East has raised his partner to 3@H you are going to play in 4@S. West cashes the two top Hearts and exits with a black card - in this case, a trump. So how should you play?|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, a child could make ten tricks - that isn't the problem. You have five Spades, two Diamonds (regardless of the location of the @DK) and two Clubs.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After drawing trumps you can always manuver to ruff the last Diamond on the table; the issue is whether you can avoid any Diamond losers at all. With West marked with not a stitch outside his Heart suit you should play East for the @D10 as well as the @DK. Lead the @DJ from table and try to run it. When East covers (as he must) you cross to table and run the @D8. When that holds (or if East covers with the @D10) you have eleven tricks and a 65% score.|

East is marked with the @SA, so your @SK is toast.

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|After three Passes we open 1@H and get a simple raise to 2@H from partner.

Holding 18 points and five excellent Hearts, that's enough encouragement for us to essay 4@H - the final contract.|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play.
West leads the @SQ, meaning that the prospects of dummy's @SK being worth anything are near-zero. We try the effect of ducking the first two Spade leads (covering with the King is no better), and ruffing the third round. |
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With a certain Diamond loser and only eight obvious tricks available (five Hearts, one Diamond and two Clubs) the problem is disposing of the two "long" Clubs in the closed hand. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, that's easy enough; they need to be ruffed on table, in the short trump hand. That will increase the winner count to ten (seven Hearts, one Diamond and two Clubs). This is 100% safe (unless a defender trumps the @CA or @CK), because we can ruff the low Clubs with dummy's @HA and @H8. These are both unbeatable – we have all the outstanding high trumps in hand.|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, we cash the @CA K and ruff a Club with the @H8. Ruffing the third Club with dummy's @H3 would be akin to sending a five-year old to the supermarket. Don't send a boy on a man's errand!|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once the @H8 has won the trick (as it must, of course) we can return to hand with a trump, ruff the last Club with the @HA, re-enter our hand with the @DA and claim enough tricks for the contract. (In fact, we could even have cashed the @DA before starting on the Clubs, to ensure that nobody could ruff it.) |

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|South has a prime 17-count, but no reason not to open 1NT, with such balanced shape. His partner's Stayman 2@C inquiry attracts a double, and North follows this up with an invitational 2NT. South raises to game since he has a maximum hand, despite reservations about the club suit. |
pg| ***** 248 ***** |


nt|^b@2
South ducks the opening club lead against 3NT, then wins the second round. There are eight tricks on top (three spades, two hearts, two diamonds, and a club) and there is no time to get a diamond trick, since the defense will surely be able to cash out the clubs and beat him. |
pg| ***** 249 ***** |


nt|^b@2
Instead, South appears to needs to set up a ninth trick somewhere without losing the lead. However a slightly better approach is to cross to the @HK and give up a club. if the suit breaks 4-4 you can go after diamonds in safety.|
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


nt|^b@2
If the suit is (or appears to be) 5-3, go after spades by taking your best shot in the suit, which is to lead a spade to the @s10. If this holds, a 50% shot, that is the ninth trick. South can unblock the spades, and then take all the top winners, and concede the last three tricks.|
pg| ***** 251 ***** |


nt|^b@2
An alternative approach is to test the hearts to see whether the @HQJ are doubleton. Then to fall back on the spade finesse. But that way you might go down when clubs were 4-4.|
pg| ***** 252 ***** |


nt|^b@2
Your approach to playing 3NT would have been vastly different on any other lead, where you would just concede a diamond trick and set up that suit. But here you had to appreciate that with the clubs poised to run against you, you could not afford to give up a trick in a side-suit. |

You have to make a loser disappear. There's no way to trump a loser in dummy or dump a loser on a dummy winner. Therefore, everything hinges on the Diamond suit.

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Good things happen to people who do things good! East must hold the @DK and your play has neutralized that threat. Was the Diamond finesse a straight 50-50 shot?|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


nt|^B@2 
Not really. East came into the bidding, so was strong favorite to have most of the outstanding high cards.
 
From here the hand is easy - you have sufficient winners. (Three Clubs, the @DA and a master trump).|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|As dealer we open 1@H and see partner raise to 2@H. Before we can say anything, East enters the fray with 2@s. Does that alter much? Not really. We have a 19-point hand, so feel it worthwhile going on to game. |
pg| ***** 283 ***** |


nt|^B@2
[Note: Although a jump to 4@H is justified on this hand there are two features that should make us a little wary. One is the fact that we are 5-3-3-2, a pattern that often disappoints in the play because of having too many losers. The other is that we are sure to get a Spade lead now, straight into our weakness. Not what we want…] |
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Play. 
West dutifully leads his partner's suit and, as declarer, we have to take stock of the dummy. As ever, we shouldn't take the car out of the garage till we know where we're going. In other words, we must take time out to Count and Plan. |
pg| ***** 285 ***** |


nt|^B@2
We can see four possible losers (three certain Spades and an uncertain Diamond), so we know we need one loser to disappear. With no way of dumping a loser anywhere, the only way to make that happen is to try the Diamond finesse. |
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


nt|^B@2
East plays four rounds of Spades and we carefully ruff the fourth one with the Ten of Hearts. Trumping with the Two would be a serious blunder – it would be sending a boy on a man's errand. West would over-ruff and crow about the hand for months. |
pg| ***** 287 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Having survived that minor hurdle we must draw trumps. They have no other purpose and we can count sufficient winners (if the Diamond finesse is right). It is more convenient to end up in dummy after pulling trumps to take our finesse, so we play the @HA Q first, and then play the @HK. If trumps were 2-2 then we'd have wasted a round of trumps but we can afford that particular luxury.|
pg| ***** 288 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Well, now is the moment of truth. The Diamond finesse is necessary for the contract; we need East to hold the @DK underneath our @DA Q tenace. There are strong grounds for expecting that East has the offending King. Firstly, East's overcall suggests that he has all the missing high cards (and West has nothing – if that).|
pg| ***** 289 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Secondly, as the play proceeds, something else happens to reinforce the belief that the @DK is onside: West discards the @D2. Usually that shows a total lack of interest in the suit. Well, whatever… we need the Diamond finesse come hell or high water so need to take it no matter what information we can read from the swirling mists of our crystal ball. |
pg| ***** 290 ***** |


nt|^B@2
We lead a low Diamond, East plays low and we try the Queen. Is our luck in today? Yep! The finesse holds and we easily have the rest with master Clubs and the last trump. 

4@H makes with five Hearts, two Diamonds and three Clubs.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bridge is a partnership game. It is very important that you have a trusting bond with your partner else you might see yourself playing against three opponents rather than two! 

So just how much do you trust your partner?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|What do you make of this lead?|
PG| ***** 296 ***** |


AT|

It must be three or four cards to an honor or a singleton. (Under your method partner wouldn't lead a low card from three or four low ones)|
PG| ***** 297 ***** |

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You can see two tricks in your hand (your two aces), but where can you find three more? Can partner have a singleton diamond?|
PG| ***** 298 ***** |


AT|

Probably not. That would give declarer four diamonds and he is likely to have bid 2@D over 2@C. Where else can you look for additional tricks?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You should return your highest club.
 
Firstly, you should realize that partner has signaled for a club when he led the @H3.|
PG| ***** 309 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Secondly, I am sure everyone can see that the defense has nothing else to go for except a heart ruff. However, we should make it 100% clear to partner by returning the @C8 - it is best to avoid any confusion at all times, no matter how obvious the play might seem to you.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: The opponents had a natural and an invitational auction to 3@s. |
PG| ***** 314 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Opening Lead: @D2 - although a fourth best heart is definitely a reasonable alternative. |
PG| ***** 315 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play: After winning the diamond lead with the ace, you then had to think about the best way to defeat this 3@s contract. 

At first you might think that it's possible that partner has led from a singleton diamond (so we return a diamond to give partner a ruff) but a careful analysis from the bidding suggests that declarer is unlikely to hold four diamonds as declarer did not rebid 2@D over 2@C. |
PG| ***** 316 ***** |


NT|^b@2
With such intimidating clubs in dummy (and four small clubs in your hand), you should turn your attention to the heart suit if you hope to defeat this contract. Having the @sA (control) gives you a big advantage since it makes a heart ruff entirely possible - so you return the @H9. |
PG| ***** 317 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If our partner has the @HA then he can duck our heart switch to keep communication, and if our partner has the @HK instead, we'd then have to hope that our partner will have a side-suit entry back to his hand to provide us with a heart ruff. On the @H9 switch declarer plays low as partner plays the king, winning, and the @H3 is returned. |
PG| ***** 318 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This heart card, the @H3, is a suit-preference signal since our @H9 switch suggested that it was from shortness. Therefore, with this information in mind, when declarer plays off the @sJ from dummy we must not play a low spade from reflex (i.e. playing low and hoping declarer finesses into partner's potential @sQ) because our partner has told us that he has a club entry.|
PG| ***** 319 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So it is prudent that we keep our @s3 intact and rise with the @sA, switch to the @C8 (also a suit-preference signal, suggesting that partner returns back a heart), and collect our heart ruff.|
