^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first thing that should occur to me is that we must be in at least game with my hand. New Minor Forcing applies here. But I recommend everyone switch to Checkback Stayman. They are similar but not identical.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In straight Checkback, over 1NT, 2@C is ALWAYS asking about a major suit, even if partner opened 1@C. With no major, partner bids 2@D - not 2NT. This 2nd part is very important and gives responder (the 2@C bidder) much more flexibility.|mb|2c|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand 2@C asks about majors whether playing Checkback or New Minor Forcing. But the response is different. Here, it asks Georges if he has 3 hearts. With no major, playing New Minor Forcing, Georges has to bid 2N. but playing Checkback he bids 2@D.|mb|p2d|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand it turns out not to matter but on some hands it will. In this particular auction I am just asking about hearts - 3 hearts. Obviously if North had spades he would have bid 1@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correctly played Georges. Even though the diamond finesse happens to work, Georges should not take it. He also thanks the opponent for not leading a spade and takes his 9 sure tricks.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am a "lead your best unbid suit" believer against NT, so I think Betty should lead a spade. The only question is which spade. In general, either 4th best or top of a 3 card honor sequence. But with her particular holding Betty should lead the @SK. The lead of the king against NT is not necessarily top of a sequence (although it often is).|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of the King asks partner for attitude about the suit. If East leads the @SK, West should play the @S6 to hopefully encourage a spade continuation. The 6 should look encouraging (the 5 and 4 are missing) so East should continue with the @S9. West should overtake and lead back a spade. They take 4 spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of the ace against NT is very rare. Traditionally, and the way I play it, is that the lead of the ace in NT means partner should drop an honor (jack or higher) if they have it. The most common holding where the ace is led is something like AKJ10 where dropping the queen is useful.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lacking an honor (which is what happens most of the time) partner should give count. In summary, the lead of an ace against NT asks partner to a) drop an honor or b) if no honor give count.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me briefly discuss "xyz" and "2 way Checkback" before we go to the next board.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play 2 way Checkback, over 1NT a bid of both 2@C and 2@D by responder are artificial. 2@C shows an invitational hand. 2@D shows a game forcing hand (and is often used to explore for slam, even perhaps in a minor suit). There are a lot of subtleties, but the basic 2 way Checkback, even if you want to skip the subtleties is pretty easy to play.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If responder bids 2@C it is up to opener to get to game if he has a maximum hand.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If responder bids 2@D, then the auction is easy because a game force has been established. You have lots of room to explore for the best contract, including slam. The advantage of 2 way Checkback is the 2@D game forcing bid.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
wik54:  Is 2@D game forcing even if diamond was opened?|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, 2@D is totally artificial.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
 eliana:  What if I want to play 2@D?|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 answers to that.
^C@2The first is, don't worry about that, because there are very few hands where you want to play 2@D rather than 1NT. But if you want to play the expert version of 2 way Checkback which I explain next. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd answer is, if responder bids 2@C over 1N, opener MUST bid 2@D. No ifs ands or buts. Then you can stop in 2@D. So if you prefer the expert way, you can stop in 2@D.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The "xyz" is an extension of 2 way Checkback so named because it applies whenever the auction starts 1x-1y-1z. There is a 1-level opener, responder bids at the 1-level, and opener rebids at the 1-level. For example, if you play "xyz" it applies if the auction starts 1@C-P-1@H-P-1@S or 1@D-P-1@H-P-1@S.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 1@S, 2@C is an artificial game invitation and 2@D is an artificial game force. It is a lot more complicated, however, because there are many more auctions it applies to and the follow ups depend on how the auction starts. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend:
^C@2a) start with 1 way Checkback over 1NT (e.g. 2@C is always asking about majors whether opener started with 1@C or not).|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^c@2
b) if you want to get adventurous, try 2 way Checkback after a while. the recent Bergen audio lesson is a great learning tool. Check the link given earlier by nome (Kia).|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^c@2
c) don't bother with xyz. I tried it with one partner for a while and it came up once in a year. So I am not a big fan of xyz and I have no opinion about the questions asked by a few of you since I have little experience with xyz.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some might open 3@C with my hand. But I did not do it for several reasons such as a) only 6 clubs, b) no singleton, c) vulnerable, and d) 2nd seat.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


mb|p|mb|1S|MB|X|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Betty what are you going to do when partner bids clubs. Actually given you are a passed hand, and you don't have clubs, double is possible, although a bit misleading. Here is why. If partner bids clubs you can always correct to diamonds. On the other hand, if you were not a passed hand, that would show a strong hand with diamonds. But since you are a passed hand, you can't have a strong hand with diamonds.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you "doubled and corrected" partner would understand what you had. In fact some experts play the specific auction where you double and correct clubs to another suit (usually diamonds) is not strong even if you are an unpassed hand. The nerdy bridge name for that approach is called "^*Bequal level conversion^*N" :), meaning if you double and correct to the same level, that shows the other 2 suits.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given you have 4 spades, the risk of a misfit is high and you might want to pass anyway.|

PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Occasionally when you have a game force, you have to jump shift into a 3 card minor, but here you have a real suit. It is not the suit quality. It is the fact that we should be in game. |mb|3C|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have a problem. If I had a red suit stopper I would bid it: hoping to get to 3NT. As a mater of principle, I hate playing in 5 of a minor when 3NT is a possibility. I could be deceptive and bid a trick "3@D" with my one "honor" suit and hope that dissuades a diamond lead, but I will play it straight and bid 5@C and hope that it makes. 3@C certainly made my hand much better.|mb|5C|

PG| ***** 66 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You bid 2N after partner opens Weak-2. Further, if partner opened a weak 2@S would you bid? Especially because you are short in spades. Even with a stronger hand, with short spades you need to be very cautious.|UB||

mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now having said that, Betty is about to be punished for making the correct bid :). I am tempted not to do this, just to reward her, but my correct bid is double. Because a double by my pard would be negative over 2@S. I have to protect if I suspect she might have a penalty double she couldn't make.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So any time I am short in spades - in this hand, I should reopen with a double. That is a takeout double, but I should not be surprised if partner passes. That is how you allow partner to play both negative and penalty doubles.|mb|d|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Betty could make an "sos" redouble, but I don't think its a good idea. It is pretty unlikely that they have a 4-4 fit somewhere else, and even if they do, they are 1 level higher. I would pass. Redouble might be right but you are likely ending up in a 7 card fit.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a bridge saying that applies here Betty. It is "What do you call an 8 card suit?" And the answer is "trump" :). Or as Marty Bergen says, "He who knows goes" You only have 7, but it is good enough. Regardless, it does pass the "singleton test" however.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What is the singleton test? |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT|If you are happy to play in your suit opposite a singleton, you should do so. Partner almost never has a void (this hand of course being an exception). And Betty's suit meets that test. Only likely 1 loser opposite a singleton.|mb|4h|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A support double would show 3 spades which she has. And normally I am a big believer in bidding "support with support", but this is a rare case where 4@H is a better bid. Even if we have a spade fit, as Betty says, it may be hard to get to her hand to run hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In summary, if you have a suit that meets the singleton test, even if you have a potential fit in another suit, it is fine to play in your long suit. Another of those darn bridge exceptions that make this game ^*Bexasperating but interesting^*N.|

PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It might have crossed your mind to look for a slam on this deal. As it is, even 4@S isn't safe. It would have been a cake-walk against any other lead but this West has found the best lead for his side. Curse the man. Well, you know the routine. Count and Plan.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPual Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|There may be a loser in the spades - everything depends on the suit break. There are three losers in hearts. No possible loser in diamonds - four tricks. No loser in clubs.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are three losing Hearts here and that will make the contract "tight". After that we have to avoid a trump loser. So you need to focus on that as the opponents are cashing their tricks in Hearts.|

Now, how should you tackle trumps? You have nine between you so are missing four cards. In point of fact, you have no finesse position available so you really have little choice...|

NT|^B@2
The fall of West's @S10 has opened up a new possibility for you. Although your original Plan should have been to cash the @SA K hoping to drop the @SQ singleton or doubleton you now have a finesse available.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You could, if you choose, play off the @SK (hoping Spades are 2-2) or, alternatively, you could cross to dummy and run the @SJ, playing the @S10 to be singleton (and East to hold @SQ 5 4).|

With the @SQ falling the rest of the hand is pianola. You have tricks to burn. You couldn't go off now if you threw the cards against a wall and played them as they fell.|mc|10|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


UP|24|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPual Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This would have plenty of tricks if West led a Spade, a Diamond or a Club but your evil-minded left-hand opponent unerringly finds your weak spot with the @hA lead. East enthusiastically encourages with the @h9 so the defenders have three tricks in the bag before you can blink.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, at least this is an easy hand to analyze. Simply put, you need to pull in the trump suit without loss. You have nine trumps without any finesse available so you have to hope the @SQ falls in one or two rounds.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you lead off the @SA and… West drops the @S10. This opens up an intriguing possibility as you now have a finesse position in trumps. You could cross to dummy and run the @SJ, playing West for the singleton @S10 and East for @SQ 5 4.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So which is more likely? That West was dealt @SQ 10 doubleton or the singleton @S10? The odds are close but it is fractionally better (a couple of percentage points) to play off the @SK hoping for an original 2-2 break. That works here and the rest of the hand is child's play.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2
(If you hate statistics and probability you might skip this paragraph. Still, it is interesting…Honest!) Players are often confused when they look at a table of odds. A 3-1 break (50%) is more likely than a 2-2 break (40%), even if that in itself is counter-intuitive. Here, having cashed the @SA and seen the @S10 why shouldn't we take the Spade finesse as the 3-1 break is more likely than a 2-2 break?|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Good Question! Well done for asking it (!) The answer is that the odds change with every card played. Once the @SA has bought forth the @S10 (LHO) and the @S4 (RHO) it is no longer possible that Spades are 4-0 nor that they are 3-1 with the singleton @SQ. The odds now say that the remaining cards are more likely to break 1-1 than not – although it is close.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, by following the original plan of cashing the @SA K you bring home the bacon in 4@S.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|East-West bid to 3NT after you have decided to interject 1@S. North leads the @SK in response to your overcall and initially you worry that this will set up two tricks for declarer's @SQ J × ×. Never fear! Partner obliges with the @SQ and you have to defend accurately. How?|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Firstly, you have to recognize that declarer must have a Spade stop for his bidding – hoping that partner will turn up with a third Spade is a pipe-dream. So, taking advantage of the @S9 in the dummy, you overtake the @SQ with the @SA and clear the Spades.|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The deal isn't over, however. Declarer submits you to five rounds of Clubs, wringing four discards from your hand. Three Diamonds are easy but what to throw on the fifth Club? A weak defender might baulk at chucking a Heart and would throw a Spade but that is an illusion. |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3NT is undefeatable if West were to hold @HJ × ×. You have to throw a Heart and hope. Hope that is, that West has @HJ × or that North (in addition to his delicious Spade honors) has the @HJ. Declarer has no play for the contract after you throw a Heart away and concedes one off. |
