^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You do like to overcall at the 2-level with a 6-card suit or a pretty nice 5-card suit. So I think the double is ok. However, the downside is partner will not play you for 5 hearts.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sitting West, I would probably bid 2@H. The singleton spade makes it likely N/S have a spade fit so I want to show my hearts, but that is risky. Having said that, however, double would probably be chosen by more experts than 2 hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't mind 2@H. However, I have problem with it. West likely does not have 4 hearts or has a very weak hand because he did not make a negative double over 1@S. On the other hand, 2@H does show a strong hand with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts. In this case is a good bid, especially considering the quality heart suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should they be in slam?|

AT| Absolutely not. It is on 2 finesses which makes it 25%. And this hand illustrates the problem with these double dummy solvers they pass out at local clubs. The double dummy solver would say you can make 6@H which is correct, but that does not mean it is a good contract.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you bid 25% slams, you will be minus in the long run as they will go down 75% of the time. so although 6@H makes, no expert would want to be there looking at the EW cards.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have to decide what to do. I certainly have no problem bidding 4@H--LOTT, but I have to consider tactics here. It is virtually certain EW are bidding 4@S. So if I intend to bid 5@H over 4@S, I should bid 5@H now. That is called an "advanced sacrifice." I am anticipating they are bidding 4@S and am taking the sac immediately to take up bidding room.

However with 5 spades and a void in hearts, bidding 5@S is certainly a reasonable alternative and is likely to be right. But it is not 100% certain that it is right  which is why I bid 5@H.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West is only promising 4 spades. There are many hands where East should raise with 3 card support. 2@S tends to show 4 spades but may be done on 3 with certain hands. |

My criteria for raising with 3-card support, is I have 3 to the A, K, or Q  and shortness somewhere (hopefully a singleton, but a small doubleton is acceptable if there is no better bid than raising).|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think North should bid clubs. Many experts play that 2@C in this auction (when the opponents have mentioned 2 suits) is natural because a takeout double is available. However, I agree that many players would assume that 2@C was Michaels. But, I think 3@C is the best call over 1@S. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Passing and coming in later, as Ben did, is also an option. The only disadvantage of that approach is that it gives the opponents an extra round of bidding to communicate which, all things being equal, is not desirable in a competitive auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think Ogust is much better than feature. Particularly if you play wide ranging Weak-2s as I do. Of course, if I ever bid 3@S over Ogust (good suit good hand) my partner would have a shock and not know what to do because it hardly happens.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very unlucky. 4@H is a good contract and would make with a normal trump break. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Personally, I would open the West hand 1@H. It meets the rule of 20. On the other hand, it is aceless so I don't hate 2@H. But with the quality heart suit and almost quality diamond suit, I think it is a pretty nice hand. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Granted Qx of spades is dubious, but @DQJ10 although officially "quacky" is really not. Its worth a trick, actually better than Kxx as it always takes a trick.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it turns out all roads lead to 4@H and, had I allowed partner to defend the way she was going to, 4@H would have made. Remember, even when you overbid, it is easy for the opponents to misdefend.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret has 3 ways to raise spades.
2@S which tends to show 3 spades and less than a limit raise.
3@S which shows 4 spades and less than a limit raise, and
2@H which shows 3+ spades and a limit raise.|
