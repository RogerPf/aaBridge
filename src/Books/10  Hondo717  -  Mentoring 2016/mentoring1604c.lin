^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H is a tad aggressive, but with 5/5 distribution it has some merit. Unfortunately, it is going to cause me to make a non optimal opening lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally I would play 2nd hand low. However, in this case, I know the spades are all good, so I want to take my ace before it disappears. Therefore, you are allowed to (very occasionally) play 2nd hand high, but only when you have a VERY GOOD reason. The most common reason is when you have the setting trick. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Obviously not true here. The other reason (and I hesitate to bring this up because some students will abuse this reason) is when you are 100% POSITIVE that you will lose the trick if you don't take it. Please note the 100% positive. Many students take their aces 2nd hand because they have a feeling that it will go away.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not good enough. Better to plan 2nd hand low smoothly all the time and occasionally lose a trick because the tricks you will gain playing 2nd hand low smoothly will far outweigh the occasional loss.|pc|cA|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first look a little more at the bidding. Game is marginal at best. If EW is in game it should be 4@S not 5@D. It turns out 4@S is down 1 because they lose 2 hearts 1 club and 1 spade.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
intempo2:  Could I open 1NT with 2 doubleton?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I definitely would not open 1NT with the East hand. Some people do open 6-3-2-2 hands 1NT when the 6 card suit is a minor. I do not because I believe that distorting your shape by bidding 1NT makes it a less accurate bid and a less accurate auction. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, even those who do, usually only open 1NT when their 6 card suit is weakish. In this case, East's suit is very strong, and can bid 3@D over a 1@H or 1@S bid by pard. So there is no rebid problem. The reason to open an off shape 1NT is if you have a rebid problem but that is not the case here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C was perfectly reasonable, but you would prefer to show your hearts as North if you could. He could double. Yes, he doesn't have diamonds. But with 7-4, I would not mind treating this as a double and correct hand. If partner bids diamonds then I bid clubs over diamonds. However, having said that, it is virtually never wrong to want to play in your 7-card suit, So 2@C was fine.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is a defensive signal I can make that occasionally comes up. If I play the Queen, that specifically shows the Jack.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure why West did that. Although it is likely West will lose a diamond, it is not a sure thing. On this hand he does know, because North started with 7 clubs, that I just about can't have the doubleton diamond king. But it can't hurt to ruff, take the diamond finesse and hope the king drops.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And now he will end up losing an extra trick since he can't get to dummy to take the diamond finesse. What West did by throwing a diamond is called a "loser on loser" play. He thought he had a diamond loser, and he probably did. So by throwing a losing diamond on the club he in theory is not giving up a trick, especially if he wants North to remain on lead. On occasion, a loser on loser play can gain you a trick, but it is fairly rare and in this case, because of entry issues it ended up costing him a trick.|

PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then take the diamond finesse by leading a diamond to the Q, then play the @DA and another diamond. On this hand, he will end up making 5 because diamonds are not 3-3. But if they were, he could pitch his club loser on the 4th diamond and make 6.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few more comments regarding the bidding. I have guidelines for when to bid "3 over 3" (in this case 3@S over 3@D). You should bid 3 over 3 if a) you know you have a 9-card fit (using the Law of Total Tricks). It says you can bid to a 9 trick contract with 9 trumps.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
intempo2:  With 9 HCP and Vulnerable? |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Points have nothing to do with the Law of Total Tricks. The Law of Total Tricks says you count the number of trump between you and pard, and you can bid to a contract whose number of tricks equals your number of trump. It applies vul or not vul. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first reason to bid 3 over 3 is if you have a 9 card fit. And that is the most common reason. However, on this hand they do not have a 9-card fit so that does not apply.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But my 2nd guideline for bidding 3 over 3 does apply and that is when you have a singleton in their suit. So if West wanted to, he could bid 3@S using that 2nd guideline. However, in IMPs at this vul, (EW vul, NS not) I might not bid 3 any way but I would consider it. Depending on how we defend EW could easily be down 2 at least. So passing worked out ok.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other minor play issue. The @CJ was a reasonable lead. However had North been watching clubs (and I am not sure I would have seen this either) he would have realized that West mistakenly pitched too many clubs and the @C5 was good. Declarer should have pitched a heart at trick 11.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, I might not noticed that either, because it would surprise me if a defender pitched their clubs. That leads me to a point for West. You should keep "parity with dummy" in terms of dummy's suits. That means if dummy has a 4 card suit and you have 4 or more cards in that suit, you should keep at least 4 cards to make sure the low card in dummy does not set up, as it did on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is not a splinter. It asks pard to bid 3N with a heart stopper (which is not a bad bid).|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because with a minor suit, you almost always want to play 3N if you can rather than 5 of a minor, it is not as important to show the raise of a minor suit as it is to describe your hand getting to NT.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| It is possible we can make 6@C. if North has the @CAK and the @DQ it must have really good plays, and that is only 9 points. However, I will just bid 5@C and hope that is right.|mb|5C|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, on distributional hands you should use "picture bidding" when you can. Try to "picture" what partner needs to make whatever bid you are considering, and if that is a plausible picture, make the bid.|

princesess: West should have bid 4@H using LOTT.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West could bid 4@H. On this hand, despite his flat distribution, especially at equal vul, West should bid 4@H. With a 10-card fit they don't have trump trick losers and it is hard for the opps to double you without trump tricks. So I definitely think 4@H is the bid here but I still bid 5@C.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |

PG| ***** 110 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Couple of reasons:
a) 3@H is not a splinter. It asks pard to bid 3N with a heart stopper although not everybody knows that;
b) it takes up too much bidding room and makes it harder to find 3NT when that is the best contract (which it often is).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days many experts would lead a major and if I am smart enough to choose a heart, that turns out to be the best lead. But I am usually not smart enough :). So I stick with the tried and true 4th from longest and strongest of the unbid suits. I am absolutely convinced that works out better more often than any other lead in NT.|pc|d5|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here North should actually give me count and play the @D4 or @D7. Since you can't beat the 10 it is obviously not attitude. But it might be useful for me to know pard has 4 diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was holding onto my spades in case declarer had 4. I know he can't have more than 4 because he opened 1@C. But now that he pitched a spade I can afford to pitch 1 as well. This is similar to "keeping parity with dummy", but I am "keeping parity with declarer" (although that is harder because I don't know for sure how many spades he has).|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
North's (your LHO) 4@S raise is definitely on the aggressive side, so we must do our best to beat this contract.|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play: 
Our club opening lead goes to dummy's @C10 and partner's @CK. Now East switches to the @DJ. Clearly we can see that the @DJ is from a shortage, since we can see the @D10 in our own hand. Are there any clues for us to use to work out if the switch is from a singleton or a doubleton? |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Let's analyze both cases to see if our play actually matters. 

If @DJ is a singleton, we will have to win with the ace, and return the @DQ to give our partner a ruff (else we may never get our diamond trick at all since our hand is entryless).|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If the @DJ is a doubleton, we will have to duck this trick in order to keep communication with our partner (since, again, we don't have a side entry to cash two diamonds). So our play to this trick does matter. |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Using the clue based on the play to the first trick, we can determine that our partner cannot have a singleton diamond (our partner won the first trick with the @CK rather than the @CA).|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If partner had a singleton diamond, he would have won the first club with the ACE to paint a picture in our minds that declarer had the king, therefore leaving us with no choice but to play partner for a singleton diamond.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So, knowing that our partner has a doubleton diamond, our best defense is to overtake partner's jack with the queen allowing dummy to win the king. |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|^b@2
As our partner has a second diamond, he can then return it for us to cash two diamonds after declarer draws trumps and knocks out our partner's @HA. |
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^b@2
THE BOTTOM LINE: 
When partner leads a suit in which you have the ace-king as well as a side suit singleton, and your plan is to switch to your singleton, win the opening lead with the ACE, planting the thought in our partner's mind that declarer has the king - and then switch to your singleton. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If you win the opening lead with the king and then shift to an obvious short suit, partner should play you for a doubleton.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding:
The bidding is swift and routine. We open 1NT with 15 points and partner raises to game with his 10 points.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^b@2Play:
West leads the @HK to our 3NT contract and we must Plan the play. |
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^b@2
From the outset we can count seven top tricks. (Three Spades, one Heart and three Diamonds). Prospects for "extras" don't look bright in Hearts and Clubs, so we are left hoping that Spades and Diamonds will bring in an additional trick each. |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^b@2
How might that happen? Well, we have seven cards combined in both Spades and Diamonds. We also have the three top honors in both suits, so we have to hope to establish a fourth round winner in both suits. |
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Can that work? Yes, if lady luck smiles on us. With a seven-card fit in Diamonds and in Spades it leaves the opponents with six cards in both suits. A lucky 3-3 break would leave the last, "long" card a winner after the three top honors have been played off. Here we need two 3-3 breaks... That's more than "lucky". The opponents will regard it as outrageous fortune.|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^b@2
It may seem a little difficult to keep track of the specific cards that are played but there is a better solution than counting cards after they have been played. Here, we should do our counting in advance (so to speak). We need a 3-3 break (actually two of them) so we should realize that  both opponents need to follow suit to three rounds. If one of them shows out on the first, second or third round then the baby Spade (or Diamond) has not grown up into a winner.|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT|^b@2
For instance, when playing Diamonds we cash the Ace then the King-Queen and watch what happens. If both opponents follow to all three rounds of the suit we can be sure that dummy's @D7 is a winner. |
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So, after winning the @HA, we should start by cashing the @DA (why the @DA first? Play the high cards from the short suit first) and follow with the @DQ then the @DK. When both opponents follow to the third round of the suit we are confident that the "thirteener", the @D7, is a fourth round winner. |
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Note what happens on the last Diamond, by the way. Did anyone pitch a Spade? This is important because that's our next port of call and, if we miss a vital discard, we may miscount the Spade suit.|
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Next, we turn our attention to Spades by cashing the Ace first, followed by the Queen then the King. Why take the @SA first? Play the honors... yeah, you've got it. Do both opponents follow to three rounds of Spades? No! However, we have been eagle-eyed and spotted that the @S2 was dumped by West on the @D7.|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The @S6 has duly grown up into a mature winner and needs to be cashed, pronto. That's the ninth (and final) trick. The rest belong to the frustrated defenders, who must have thought that victory was theirs.|
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT|^b@2

On this deal, we need both Spades and Diamonds to split 3-3 in order to obtain two additional tricks to our seven top tricks. Two 3-3 breaks on one hand represents a 6-1 shot against us. Still, when Lady Luck walks past she must be embraced...|
