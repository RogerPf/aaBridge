^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, the bidding:
North's approach happened to work out but he really is too strong to open 1NT. North has 18 HCP and 4 quick tricks though the hand is 4-3-3-3.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One of the rules I use to decide how good a marginal hand is what I call "Quick Trick" points. To use it I count my Quick Tricks. In this case North has 4 Quick Tricks.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are a possible 8 quick tricks (2 in each suit). Since there are 40 HCP, each quick trick is worth around 5 points (40 / 8).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So with 4 quick tricks I have 20 "Quick Trick" points. If your hand has fewer HCP than Quick Trick points, it is better than it looks. Basically the idea is having quick tricks is good and makes your hand better.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It's just another way of giving more value to aces and kings and less value to queens and jacks. So North's hand is better than it looks (18 HCP but 20 quick trick points). Therefore it is definitely too strong to open 1NT IMO.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What about East pass? East has a nice 6 card suit although it is a flat hand. Further, you should take every opportunity to compete over 1NT if you can, especially if you play DONT |CP|1|AT|^*hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont^*N|CP||at|.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would have doubled with her hand (1 suited hand). West would then bid 2@C (forced by the double) and East would bid 2@H.I don't think I would compete.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Not sure how well they do. The take 5 hearts and 2 clubs. If they can manage a diamond or a spade, 2@H will make. And I think North will eventually get end played and have to give East a spade trick.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So although 1NT worked out, it would not have worked if I were East because I would have competed to 2@H.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the lead, in NT, in general you lead the top of a 3-card sequence or 3-card "broken" sequence. You lead K from KQJ or KQ10 and the lead of the King asks partner for attitude. So partner plays high with an honor, low with no honor.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. I am not sure what East should bid over 1@S. The problem with 1NT is she only has a doubleton diamond. I probably pass with her hand and play in a 4-3 fit at the 1 level. I might then bid 2@D with my hand, but I might not.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib:  What is the better fit 4-3 or 5-2?|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5-2 is better than 4-3.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss why some people play what is known as "lavinthal" discards when defending NT. The problem with North having to discard a high heart to show he likes hearts is it might give away a length trick.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To counter that, some people play Lavinthal which is similar to the suit preference signal you give partner when leading a card for partner to ruff. In Lavinthal the suit that is discarded is not a signal for that suit, but a suit preference for the other suit.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A high discard means partner likes the higher of the other 2 suits. A low discard means he likes the lower of the other 2 suits. Playing Lavinthal discards, if North discarded the @S10 on my diamond it would show he likes the higher of the 2 suits (hearts). The 2 remaining suits are hearts and clubs.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A low spade would say I should lead a club. The lower of the 2 suits. I am not a big fan of Lavinthal because a lot of times you don't know what you want partner to lead.I just use standard signals.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. had East been carefully watching the spade cards the hand can be made. Since North discarded a spade and had the @S109 it turns out the spades and @S75 were both good.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


lc|s75|NT|^B@2
That gives her 4 spade tricks, 1 heart trick and 2 club tricks for 7 tricks. Alternatively, East can keep clubs in the West hand and take the club finesse and make 1NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Contrary to what you may have heard from some players, the negative double only promises the unbid major. It does not say anything about the other unbid suit (diamonds). Basically think of the negative double on this hand as the legal way for North to bid 1@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is hard to play, but here is how I would play it. I would win the spade and lead a heart, hoping for 2 hearts, 3 spades, 1 club, and 1 diamond at least.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That gets me to 7. If the @CA is onside I get 8. Or if I can manage 2 diamond tricks with my @DAJ10 of diamonds I get 8. However, the outcome is far from clear.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the question is, should North bid 2NT. It is certainly a reasonable bid. However, it is not as obvious as it looks. I only bid 2@C not 3@C. So I am limited to 15 or so and could easily have less.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With only 2 little clubs and a marginal spade stopper it is pretty unlikely we can make 3N. So passing 2@C is an option (although most players would bid 2N).|

AT| Normally 5 over 5 is not a good idea, but with 6-5 and favorable vul (EW not vul, NS vul) it has some merit. But that might push us into 6.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that. they lose only 3 tricks assuming East plays the spades correctly which I am sure he will :). This once again goes to show you that distribution is often more important than HCP. |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would rather have a weak 6-5 hand than a balanced strong NT any day.|

However, these hands do not fit well and the defenders have found a good lead. The spade finesse will surely be necessary unless the opponents have a brainstorm.

PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|  
A low spade is clearly wrong - you'll win that on the table with the @S10 and the lead will be in the wrong hand. You'll be lucky to be able to ruff a diamond back to hand.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^b@2 
What's wrong with the @SJ? The answer is nothing IF the trumps are 3-2. However, what if West has @SK x x x?|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^b@2 
Now play the hand through in your head... The @SJ will hold (West won't cover) and a second spade will be won in dummy. Now, how do you pick up the @SK x in West's hand?|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^b@2 
The @S9 is always a winner. If West has the @SK it will hold the trick. Then you lead the @SJ and that will hold the trick, too (West can cover if he likes - you will like, too). But now you are in the right hand at the right time..|

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|When South responds 1@S to the 1@D opening bid (it is nearly always right to introduce a four-card major no matter how bad the suit, in response to a minor-suit opening). |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^b@2
North jumps to 4@C. This is a splinter-bid, showing a very good hand and some slam interest, with four-card spade support. |
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^b@2
South has enough to cooperate with a cue-bid below the game level, but he has only four bad trumps, and so much of his hand is wasted in the club suit that South should probably not cooperate with a slam try. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^b@2
West has a clear-cut lead of the @HK against 4@S, and the defense rattle off the first three tricks in hearts; then East gets off lead with a club. South takes the @CA and crosses to hand with the @DA, to play trumps. |
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Now is the moment where a careless slip could cost the contract. If South leads the @SJ and follow up with a spade to the @S10, he is in the wrong hand to repeat the spade finesse, if trumps are 4-1 onside. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^b@2
It is much better to start with the @S9, and then he can follow up with the @SJ, underplaying dummy's @S10. Now the lead remains in the South hand, and can take the trump finesse one more time, to make the contract. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^b@2
With holdings such as the spade suit here, it is easy to imagine that you are home free if the finesse succeeds. But if you take the time to work through the combination you will see that there is more to it than that.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Did you think, by the way, that there was an alternative winning line? Perhaps you could lead the @SJ and underplay the @S10 on that when West didn't cover? Now you can run the @S9 and the result is the same, you think? |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Oops, no! West wouldn't co-operate in your plan. He wouldn't cover the @SJ but he would cover the @S9. Now his modest @S7 6 5 would be worth a trick.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|We make the assumption that you have met the Blackwood convention whereby 4NT asks for Aces. come with a government health warning as it asks for trouble more often than it effectively asks for useful cards. There are few conventions in bridge more abused than this one. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Here 4NT is NOT Blackwood. In other words, partner is not asking for Aces, he is raising No-trumps. How can you tell what 4NT means? |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Well, for 4NT to be Blackwood you have to have agreed a suit between you. If not, how can you sign-off at the five-level if there are insufficient Aces? |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^b@2
A natural bid of 4NT is called a ^*BQuantitative Raise^*N. Its function is to get partner to make a choice between Passing 4NT or advancing to 6NT. Think of it as being analogous to the sequence 1NT – 2NT where the response is inviting you to bid game. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Essentially 2NT is a buck-passing bid to a game. 4NT as a quantitative raise is a buck-passing bid to a possible slam.|

^-|ht|g|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|This article will focus on what card to lead against suit contracts. In the examples below, the bidding has been 1@S on your right, 2@S on your left, all pass.

Sometimes the bidding will give you enough information to sway you from your "normal" lead. On this sequence, you don't know much other than opener has a minimum opening bid with at least five spades, and responder has 6 to 9 points with three or four spades. In the following examples, the suit in question is a ^*Bside suit^*N.|ht|l|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHoward Schutzman, BBO nickname, "hondo717" edited this presentation and added several comments. Next is his general comment on leading a side suit with one honor.|

ht|o|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|In some of the examples, Lawrence is going to tell you what to lead when you lead a suit with 1 honor. Which card he tells you to lead, should you choose to lead the suit, is correct. However, in general, particularly on this auction, leading away from a suit with one honor is dangerous and will often give away a trick. Leading your longest suit with no honors is less likely to give anything away and what I recommend when possible.

Lead the @H9. This is a poor man's sequence. It helps let partner know what's going on.

Do not lead the @D9. It, too, is dangerous. I suggest leading the @D6 or another suit.|hc|d6|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I personally prefer leading low from 3 small, as Lawrence suggests. However, if you play attitude leads, where low promises an honor, leading the D9 from this holding is correct.

hf|q|lb|*COn the right click your choice.^^H7^HT87|
ht|l|at|^r@2^Z@3Do not lead the @H10. Leading the @H10 when you don't have the 9 is a dangerous lead. Don't do it. I suggest leading the @H7.|hc|h7|
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


 

ht|r|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at| In general, I strongly recommend against "Middle-Up-Down",  where you lead the middle of 3 small cards). If you play count, lead low from 3 small. If you play attitude, lead high from 3 small. Leading the middle is too ambiguous and will often confuse partner. 

So on this holding, if you play low from 3 small then the @H7 is correct. But if you play attitude from 3 small, on a holding of small cards headed by the 10, leading the 10 can be dangerous. The 10 can sometimes play an important role on defense. If you still want to lead the 10 from 10xx that is acceptable but may occasionally be costly. So, when you have a suit with all small cards headed by the 10 (and not holding the 9), you might want to play that you lead the 2nd highest (the H8 in this example). However, if your holding was @H1097, then the @H10 is correct, regardless of whether you play low from 3 small or attitude.

Some players will lead the ace from A K x x combinations. Some will lead the king. Both leads are acceptable. Discuss which one your partnership leads and stick to it.

ht|q|at|^B@2
Don't lead this suit. Remember the rule. When the opponents are in a suit contract, you should not lead suits headed by the ace. You have a perfect sequence, but your ace tells you not to lead this suit.

This is also a good suit to lead from. Lead the king. It Won't always be best, but it has huge potential.|hc|cK|

ht|s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Leading the K from KQJ is one of the best leads you can make (as in the previous example). However, when you have a suit headed by the KQ but not the J, my experience is that leading the K often gives away a trick. Having the 10 does help a little. But my advice is to avoid leading the K from KQ without the J unless your other choices look worse.
