^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, it is a good idea, if you can, to not only keep track of trumps, but your next longest suit. Of course it is best to keep track of all 4 suits, but trumps and your next longest suit are almost as good and much easier.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The bidding:
If you use raw HCP, my hand meets the rule of 20 (11 HCP + 9 cards in spades/diamonds). However, if you use Bergen "adjusted" HCP (e.g. starting points not counting length) I have to subtract 2, one each for the 2 Jx suits. And therefore I only have 9 adjusted HCP which means that 2@D is perhaps a better bid, but 1@D happened to work out better on this hand.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The bidding through 2@S was fine, but I don't think they should let us play 2@S. One of my competitive guidelines is that you should bid "3 over 2" even with an 8-card fit when the opps have an 8 card fit. That is not strictly a law of total tricks bid, but letting the opponents play in an 8-card fit at the 2 level will rarely be a good result.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At best it will be average, and often below average. It was fine for West to pass 2@S. But East, despite a balanced hand, should probably bid 3@H. Although it turns out the @SK is worthless, based on the auction it is more likely than not to be worth a trick.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
North has 5 spades and South only 3 so there is a 5/3 chance that North has the @SA at least. Slightly more actually because North would not bid 1@S with 5 low spades.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It does turn out with best defense they can beat 2@S. At trick 5 had East led back the @D10 instead of a low diamond, then West would not have to put up the @DA, and diamonds would not be set up.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2  
It's hard to know for sure, but let's see how they do in 3@H however. In 3@H by East/West say North leads the @DJ, which is a good lead given East has the trump Ace. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
They will end up losing 1 heart, 2 spades, and 2 diamond ruffs for down 1 with perfect defense. But that means North has to go up with the @HA on the 2nd heart trick.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Down 1 is rather unlucky, but better than us making 2@S. So bottom line it is usually right to bid 3 over 2 when both sides have an 8 card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is very tempting for me to bid 2@S. If you made my hand @SQJ10xx @Hx @DAJxxx @C xx I would probably do so. Moving the @HA to diamonds vastly improves my hand. Remember location of your high cards is an important factor.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having your high cards in your long suits in much better than having them in your short suits. So I will pass as I am not good enough to bid 2@S.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice bid by West. 3@H by West is not constructive. It is called "Furthering the Preempt." It is NOT an invitational bid either. It simply is a Law of Total Tricks bid saying their side has 9 trumps and therefore the 3 level is safe.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


mb|pp|NT|^B@2
At a different vul, I might be tempted to bid here, but us vul and them not means there is a lot of downside to my bidding. West's strength is unknown and she could have a pretty good hand. So I reluctantly pass, but I am worried.|

NT|^B@2
Whereas if she led the @DA, she might be doing that without the @DK and I have no way of knowing. In the "old days" (I started playing bridge in the 60s :) ) you used to lead K from AK even on opening lead.|pc|DK|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer played the hand in a reasonable way. The other alternative was to finesse the @HJ by leading the @H10 from dummy. That happens to work. Her play is correct if hearts are 2-2 or the @HJ is singleton which is probably more than 50%.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Looking at all 4 hands you can make the hand, but the way you played the hand was correct by the percentages. That leads me to discuss my pet peeve of the double dummy analyzers that live bridge clubs hand out these days. If playing at a live club, the handout would say that East can make 3@H which is technically true. But only because they look at all 4 hands.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Obviously, we can't look at all 4 hands. So you have to make the percentage play. And that is what East did. In summary my advice is to ignore the double dummy analyzers because they are very misleading.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West was very timid on this hand but it worked out. You rarely get 9 card suits. I would bid at least 4 diamonds. Turns out, assuming you play trump correctly, you make 4 diamonds--losing 2 clubs and 1 diamond.
|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You could even make a case for 5, although the unfavorable vulnerability (EW vul, NS not) is a deterrent. It is close as to whether East should double. Having 5 hearts is really good plus the @SA and the singleton diamond. It is unlikely we will escape to 5 clubs, but it is possible we could be making.|

Therefore North doesn't want to set up a heart trick for the opponents. I would lead a trump trying to cut down on club ruffs. Not going to matter here but again if you have good technique on defense it will matter a lot.|pc|D2|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This happens to be a hand where number works better although I generally have decided I like specific. But let's play ## here so I can explain what West should do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should only bid 7 if you can count 13 tricks. East can count 13 tricks--8 hearts 3 aces and 2 kings.|mb|7H|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In match points, you might bid 7NT since that would be a better match point score than 7H. But in IMPs 7H is a much better bid. The extra 10 points for 7NT are irrelevant in IMPs.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What is relevant is that if hearts do not break (although I grant that is highly unlikely), East/West would be down 1 trick in 7H but might be down more than 1 trick in 7NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss how an expert pair, who plays specific kings and "kickback" RKCB would get to 7. |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play "kickback" RKCB, then 4@S is RKCB when hearts are trump. Over 3@S, East would bid 4@S. The answers are the same, just 1 level lower e.g. (assuming 1430) 4N = 1 or 4, 5@C = 0 or 3, 5@D = 2 no queen, 5@H = 2 and Queen.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why play kickback? Because it allows you to do a queen ask if partner shows both 1 or 4 or 0 or 3. Whereas if you play 4N over 4@H as RKCB, you can't ask for the @HQ when partner bids 5@D unless you commit to 6. That is the main reason for playing kickback.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's assume specific kings and playing kickback.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


UB|12|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East bids 4@S (kickback RKCB)|MB|4SP|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West bids 5@D (2 keys no Q)|MB|5DP|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East bids 5@S (specific king ask)|MB|5SP|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And here is a little trick and another advantage of kickback. West can bid 5N to show the SK and that, in fact is her bid. Why does 5N show the @SK?|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


AT| because how else could you show it without bypassing 6@H?|MB|5NP|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that if you did not play kickback and played specific kings you can't show the @SK without bypassing 6@H. So this is another advantage of kickback. On this hand over 5S, West bids 5N to show the @SK and then East can ask about other kings. East would bid 6@C asking pard to bid 7 with the @CK.|mb|6cp7hppp|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that on this hand, EW can make 7 if West has either the @CK or the @DK. So, let's say West had the @DK but not the @CK. In that case, West cannot bid 7@H over 6@C because East was specifically asking for the @CK. But rather than just signing off in 6@H, West can bid 6@D to show the @DK. And then East, knowing that West has the @SK and the @DK can bid 7@H. I am not recommending you play any of this, but just illustrating how an expert pair might bid the hand.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Here, a routine Stayman auction takes you to a terrible 3NT contract. After West leads a Heart you are going to need a lot of luck to make this hand – you will need East to hold @SK × or @SK × ×. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^b@2
However, how do you manage the entries if East has three Spades? One thing's for sure, he won't cover the lead of the @SQ from dummy (nor the @SJ, either!)|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This hand (a well-worn theme, it has to be said) is all about entry management. Not only do you need a favorable lie of Spades but you also need a 3-2 Diamond break. Why? Because you are going to have to overtake a Diamond honor to gain access to the dummy and have the @D6 as an extra entry.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^b@2
In detail, then… take the @HA (it doesn't much matter when let's say you duck trick one) and try the @DK Q. When they break you overtake the @DJ with the @DA and run the @SQ. |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If that loses you are at least two down but here it wins. You can now take another Spade finesse, cash the @SA, cross to the carefully preserved (and what a cliché that is!) @D6 and cash the last Spade.

Lucky? You bet!|

PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^b@2 
Ruffing with the @H3 increases the risk that East can over-ruff on this round. Ruffing with the @HA increases the risk that either opponent can defeat the contract by ruffing with the @H8 on the next round.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding.
After two Passes we open 1@H and get a simple raise to 2@H from partner. Holding 18 points and five excellent Hearts, we take a shot at the Heart game. 4@H is the final contract. |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play.
West leads the @SQ against 4@H, laying waste to dummy's @SK. We try the effect of ducking the first two Spade leads (nothing is any better) and ruffing the third round. |
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^b@2
With a certain Diamond loser and only eight obvious tricks available (five Hearts, one Diamond and two Clubs) the problem is disposing of the two "long" Clubs in our hand. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Well, that's easy enough, they need to be ruffed on table, in the short trump hand. That will increase the winner count to ten (seven Hearts, one Diamond and two Clubs). |
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So, cash the @CA K and ruff a Club – but with which trump? Ruffing the third Club with dummy's @H3 is just silly. True, East may be following suit on this trick (we don't know whether he has any more Clubs left or not) but it is still careless play.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The best play is to try ruffing the third Club with the @H7. This works whenever East has a Club left and must follow suit and also when East is out of Clubs but has no @H8. |
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Here, the @H7 holds the trick, so we return to hand to ruff the last Club with the @HA. Then it's a simple matter of coming to hand with the @DA and claiming the contract with high trumps. |

Why? Well, the danger to the contract is that West, on your left, has led from @SA 10 x x x and that East, on your right, has the guarded @DQ.|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^b@2 
Now a losing Diamond finesse will have East return a Spade through your @SKx and West will cash four Spades for one down. Ducking the @SJ will all but guarantee the contract. What can East do? In practice he'll return a Spade and now you can take the diamond finesse in complete safety.|sk||

up|17|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|South has enough to open the bidding, but not enough for a 1NT opening, so he opens 1@C and rebids 1NT. North has no interest in playing in a suit game, so he has a simple raise to 3NT.|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT|^b@2
When West leads a spade against 3NT and East puts in the @SJ it would be easy for South to relax. He appears to have tricks to burn; even if the diamond finesse loses, there are four diamond tricks, two clubs, two heart tricks, and a spade trick. This is just the sort of moment to see whether there is any cloud on the horizon.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^b@2
South knows that the @SA is on his left; if spades are 5-2 the danger is that East will get in with the @dQ and lead a second spade through, and the defense might get four spade tricks and a diamond. |
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^b@2
To guard against this danger, South has a riposte, although an unnatural-looking one; he allows the @SJ to win. Say East clears the spades; if the diamond finesse loses East will have no more spades to lead. And if the spades split 4-3 originally, and West ducks the second spade to retain communications, the defense can only get three spade tricks and the @DQ. That leaves nine tricks for declarer. |
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This is a form of safety play; by ducking the first trick, you protect yourself against bad spade splits, with the @DQ being offside. |
