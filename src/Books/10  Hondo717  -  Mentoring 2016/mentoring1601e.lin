There was no mentoring session on January 27, 2016 and the Movie Maker was looking for work.
He found great material from many experts sent to him as promotional emails.
They may not measure up to our Howard Schutzman (Hondo717).
But good enough while we wait for his next mentoring session on February 3, 2016.

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Walsh is not really a convention, but more of a "Style." 

It deals with the responses to a 1@C opening bid -- and the follow-ups.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||
%%%%%example
qx||st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|3,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|What to do|ah|Walsh Style - by Larry Cohen|mb|1cp?|aT|^B@2
Let's start by examining the auction 1@C - Pass - ?. Should responder bid up the line (bidding 1@D with 4 or more) or should he bypass diamonds? For example, what should he respond to 1@C with each of the following hands?|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Here South should bypass the diamonds and show the major right away - responder might get only one chance to bid. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|With example C, South also should bypass the diamonds and show the major right away - responder might get only one chance to bid. This is the modern treatment (some call it "^*BWalsh^*N.")|mb|1s|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The theory is that with a "one-bid" hand you bypass diamonds so you can make sure to introduce your 4-card major into the auction. If you know you will get to bid twice, you can bid your diamonds first (even with 4-4 in diamonds and the major). "Knowing you can bid twice," means responder has at least ^*Bopening-bid strength^*N.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||
%%example d
qx||st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|3,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|What to do - Example D|ah|Walsh Style - by Larry Cohen|mb|1cp1dp|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|When using this style, after the partnership starts 1@C-P-1@D, the opener should rebid 1NT with any balanced hand. He can do so safely with the knowledge that a 4-4 major-suit fit won't be missed. For example, opener has:|md|0,0,SK J 9 3 HK 7 4 D7 3 CA J 5 3,0|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He opens 1@C and hears partner respond 1@D. He should rebid 1NT.|mb|1n|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT| He knows there is no chance of missing a 4-4 spade fit. (If there is one, then partner has enough to bid again and will bid spades next). |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The 1@D responder can't hold hand B) or C) - sown earlier. Note: if you are not using the "^*BWalsh^*N" (bypass @D) style, then opener would need to rebid 1@S with this hand.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Notice that when using Walsh style, opener's rebid in this auction: 1@C-1@D-1MAJ, promises real clubs. Opener won't have a balanced weak notrump (or he'd have rebid 1NT). He will be unbalanced when he opens 1@C and then bids 1-of-a-major. Example auctions:|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|There is no need for opener to mention the hearts. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Responder either doesn't have 4 (as here), or is strong enough that he will introduce them on the next round of bidding.|md|0S KT4  H86  DKT743  CJ54,0,0,0|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Opener's 1@H is not only natural (4 cards), but promises an unbalanced hand (if balanced, he would have opened or rebid in notrump). Responder should go to the known club fit instead of bidding 1NT.|

Alertable?}
^-|ht|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|ACBL does not require alerts for the bids in this article (since they are natural). But, I think that though this is becoming fairly common style (I recommend using it), opener's rebid should be alerted. If he rebids 1NT, responder should alert and if asked, explain: "He may have one or two 4-card majors." If he rebids 1-of-a-major, responder alerts and explains that opener is typically unbalanced (no jokes needed). As to responder's 1-of-a-major response, I wouldn't alert that. On the ACBL convention card, you can check the box which says "frequently bypass 4+ diamonds." It is in black, which means not alertable.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Take another look at the club suit.  We saw that if West shifts to a club the defense can only take three quick club tricks, However, if East could shift to a club, the defenders can take four! |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East has to start with the @C10. You do best to cover, partner wins the king, leads back a low club to East's ace and when East returns his last club you have the 94 and West has the J7. Voila four club tricks for the bad guys.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, if East starts with a low club, you play low, West wins the jack, leads a low club to East's ace, but when East returns the 10, you have the Q9 and can afford to cover and your 9 is a 4th round winner. East-West wind up with only three club tricks. Play it out with the clubs face up on the table to see it more clearly.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Shifting to an unblocking middle honor holding A10x, K10x, AJx, or K10x is frequently mandatory when four tricks are needed in the suit and dummy to the right has a small doubleton, both partner and declarer assumed to have four cards in the suit.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Briefly about the bidding... Normally we respond 2@D to a 2@C opener unless we have a hand with two requirements: 8-plus points and a solid-gold suit of our own. Some partnership agreements require holding the Ace of the suit, some a second-round control. Talk it over with your partner. It's important.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, let's talk about the lead. We get a real break on the lead. If we hadn't gotten a Heart lead, we'd need to collect all six Club tricks to make the contract. One thought to keep in mind when on lead behind the monster hand... it often makes sense to NOT lead from your honors, but rather make a passive lead, like maybe on this hand a top Diamond, telling Pard you've got nothing in the suit. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BUT!! We got the Heart lead and we need the break. Because we then have a little room to protect ourselves against the possible bad Club split. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We have a decision: Do we play the higher odds and go for the overtrick? Or do we think about Murphy's Law and play it safe, guaranteeing our contract (unless there's a 5-0 Club split)? |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We remember Bernie Madoff and decide to play it safe. It turns out to be a smart move. We get a 4-1 Club split and make the contract by ducking our first Club trick. 

Notice that on any other lead, we'd go down. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding the opening lead. Against 6NT you should choose a "passive" lead. Typically you lead top of nothing from your longest suit or the top of a 3 card sequence if the suit has no higher honors. No expert would choose a heart lead on this hand. Most would choose a diamond. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|However, against a suit slam contract, you should lead away from kings and queens in unbid suits when possible in the hopes of setting up a trick for your side. In suit slam contracts you typically need to establish tricks immediately before declarer can discard losers on a long side suit.

However, in 6NT, typically your goal is not to give declarer any extra tricks. It turns out 6NT is usually a lot harder to make than 6 of a suit so you don't want to give declarer any help with your lead.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThank you Howard. I guess she was trying to prove an important point. God be my witness, I have seen singleton lead against 3N and it was not in a suit bid by the partner. In this ^*Ienchanting^*N game anything is possile.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|There's no Heartache like being dumped when you were sure you saw happiness ahead. And that's what we're going to do to the poor declarer today. He thought his romance was going so nicely. He thought his wonderful Heart suit was going to bring the contract home. He saw Hearts and flowers in his future. But then we came along. Sniff. |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Pard's points: We have to figure the declarer for a fat opener of 14-15 since he was willing to go to game opposite his Pard's limit raise. That only leaves 6-ish for our Pard. We know where 3 of them are from his lead. We also know where the @dK is.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|This is a dandy hand if you're into breaking people's Hearts (and in bridge, who isn't?). Let's begin with a look at the hand from declarer's point of view. |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He sees one losing Spade, possibly two Diamonds and Clubs. He sees salvation in his Spades, which will receive one of those losers. Plus from the opening lead, he knows his @DK is a winner. The poor guy actually sees victory in his future. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sadly though, we are into dashing people's dreams. When we Read the Lead, we know that declarer has a winning Diamond. We don't think he's got any Heart losers and we see his Spades as a great dumping ground. |
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That leaves us with Clubs. We project a winning Club in Pard's hand. We don't think he has the @CA because we know he only has around 5-6 points. We're going to hope he has the @CQ. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At trick 1, we grab the lead and smack down a low Club at trick 2. And the miracle happens! Pard returns a Club, and we insert the @C10. It would be foolhardy to play our @CK, since the @C10 is high enough to force the @CA, and we need to preserve the @CK to prevent dummy's @CJ from being a winner. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So far so good. When the declarer goes to set up his Spades, we play our winning @CK and there you have it. We've got our four tricks, and the declarer has Heartbroken misery. |
