^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia now you have some count on the hand. Because I didn't try for slam I have a minimish hand no more than 13. Give me 12 for the sake of argument. Kia has 7. That makes 19. Dummy has 14, that makes 33. So Millie has 7ish points, within a point or 2, say 5-9.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a singleton heart and at least an 8 card fit, I am betting that 3@C is a reasonable bid. Partner could have 4 or 5 hearts (and as you can see she does) but it is more likely based on the auction that she does not. Because Kia promises 5 hearts at least and Millie has at least 2. Since I have 1 partner could have 5, but more likely she has at most 4 and maybe even 3. So I am bidding 3@C which doesn't work out so well here.|

PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, I have enough points (10) where it is not clear if they can make 4@H. Further, I know we have a 9 card club fit (perhaps 8) which means we are not taking a lot of club tricks. So I will make a tactical pass though 3@S could have been right.|mb|p|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|South has game in his own hand, enough to open 2@C. North's neutral response of 2@D attracts a lead directing double by East, but South simply introduces his suit, and North's raise is constructive, implying values. With a weaker hand he would bid 3@C as a second negative, or jump to 4@S.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^b@2
South makes two slam tries by cue-bidding his Club controls, and North accepts the second one, based on his high trump and third round controls. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^b@2
6@S would be easy on a non-diamond lead, since South could just draw trumps and play out his top Clubs, giving up a Club, but discarding a Diamond on the @C10. As it is, this line is not available on a Diamond lead, but South can do better than simply take the Club finesse. Can you spot the extra chance? |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^b@2
South takes the Diamond lead, takes the @HA, then crosses to the @S10 to ruff a Heart high. Now he goes back to the @SK and ruffs another Heart high. When the @HK falls in three rounds (which is about a 20% chance - not to be sneezed at) South goes back to dummy by playing the @S2 to the @S3, and takes the @HQ, discarding his Diamond loser. He can now take the Club finesse for the overtrick.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Had the @HK not dropped declarer would still have had very slim chances of avoiding the Club finesse - especially if East had erred by playing the @DK at trick one. South would cash one Club and exit with a Diamond, hoping whoever won the @DQ would have no Hearts left and be endplayed to lead a Club into the tenace or would give a ruff-and-discard. If that didn't work declarer would fall back on the finesse later. |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding. 
After East Passes we open 1NT with our 4-3-3-3 hand containing 15 points. Partner has an easy raise to 3NT. |
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play. 
West leads the @S2 (again!), suggesting the lowest card from a four-card suit. That tells us that we cannot lose the first five tricks (so that's good news!) but even so, the enemy have located our weak spot. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^b@2
West cashes the first four Spades, on which we dump a Heart from each hand. West exits with the J and we need the rest as the contract is "tight". Naturally enough, we turn our attention to Diamonds, our obvious source of tricks and – as in Hand 1 – we start by leading the suit through our victim (here, that's West).|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^b@2
There is nothing really to the common finesse. We play a Diamond towards a tenace holding and call for the lower card. Here we call for the Ten and stoically await our fate. |
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If the Great Dealer in the Sky has decreed that East has the King then we are one down. A shrug of the shoulders; record the score, get on with the next deal. Here, the Great Dealer is smiling on our side, frowning on East-West. |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^b@2
We brighten up when the @D10 holds, and East produces a little Diamond, as that locates the @DK for us. We return to hand, repeat the manouver of leading a Diamond through West to the @DJ and see that win as well. On the second Diamond trick we see East show out. The 4-1 break means that we cannot afford to cash the @SA at this point – we need a third finesse. |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So, back to hand (you will discover the more you play that entries are a vital part of the finesse machinery), and lead a third round of Diamonds, once again through West's @DK. When West plays low (what else could he do?), we take the @SQ and we have four Diamond tricks. |

Your call is 1@S. The need to bid a 3-card suit was mentioned in the preamble to this quiz. Here, you are completely stuck. You don't have nearly enough for 1NT (by definition that shows values -- about 6-10). You don't want to leave the double in (you would need your partner to have 6 or 7 tricks in his hand to set it). So, the least of evils is to bid the 3-card suit. It is okay if you say a little silent prayer that your partner doesn't do something horrific like jumping to 4@S.|

3@H should be your call. In the modern (my recommended) style, this shows a long suit and shapely weakish hand. This can be effective in thwarting opener (West) who might have a good hand. It is also quite descriptive to your partner. In the old days, this was invitational, but to me, that is an unneeded hair-splitting definition (you have 2@H available as 9-11, invitational -- with more, you can force to game).|
