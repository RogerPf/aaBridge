^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first thing you should always do is evaluate your hand using Bergen;s hand evaluation. Then you need to adjust taking the auction into account. With 20 Bergen Points I will be in 4@H but would not be surprised to have 4 minor suit losers.|mb|4H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In theory now I have a potential squeeze on the hand in spades and diamonds which I will show you how to try. If the person with the @DA has 4 spades, or spades are 3-3 I can make 5. However, based on the auction I know neither of those should be true. Assuming Judy had a legitimate 2N bid, she is 5-5 in the minors and started with 1 heart. Therefore, she started with 2 Spades. It is barely possible that East has the @DA and 4 spades but not likely. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nevertheless, there is no harm in trying the squeeze. Whenever you can run all the tricks but one, you have a potential squeeze and there is no harm, particularly in live bridge (FTF), in trying to make the extra trick. What I am going to do is run my hearts and throw diamonds from dummy. If the @DA does not appear (and it won't) then I have to hope that either someone has to discard a spade or they are 3-3 (which I already know they are not).|

NT||lb|*yShould South draw all trumps ASAP?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although you often draw trump ASAP, sometimes you need to delay. The 2 most common reasons to delay drawing trump are a) you need to ruff something in the hand with short trump (not on this hand) or b) you need to knock out a high card before running out of trump, as on this hand. Reason (b) occurs mostly when you have a 4-4 fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now normally missing the @S10 and @SQ I would finesse for the Q through East. However, in this case with the preempt, it is much more likely that West has the @SQ and somewhat more likely than normal that she has 4 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now that the @S10 is out, I should be all set. I will lose at most 1 spade.

I will be out of trump and they can run hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Judy did make the correct bid of 1@H which is the bid all of you would make. However, I might choose to break the bidding rules on this hand. You probably are anxious to ask why. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well with a singleton spade North can figure out the opps have a spade fit and spades are higher than hearts so they can outbid us.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|How should North know that?|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South did not open 1@S. So he cannot have more than 4 spades except in the very rare instance when he has 6 diamonds and 5 spades which occurs so infrequently you don't worry about it. Therefore, the opponents have at least an 8 card spade fit, and more likely a  9 card fit. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Thus, particularly at this vul, I might choose to bid a tactical (and technically incorrect) 3@D bid to make it harder on the opps to find their fit. Again, please note as I said 1@H is the technically correct bid, but in this board not so great tactically.|md|0,S35TH7KAD29AC35TQ,0,skq9742hqt54c97d6|

PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, a sophisticated partnership might do the following:
a) have 2@D show a 3-card limit raise

mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sandy should bid 4@S in any case. With an opener and nice points in the opps suit, 3 quick tricks her minuses are the 4-3-3-3 distribution and weak 3-card support. But the plusses overcome the minuses.|mb|4S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the unfortunate spade position always down 1. regardless, you should be in 4@S. Most of the time you will lose only 1 spade. The only time you lose 2 spades is when I have AJx.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Looking at the 2 hands, you will make 4@S about 80% of the time. So you want to be in 4@S. If it goes down because of unlucky spades so be it. Which brings up another one of my pet peeves.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the "double dummy" analyzers they distribute on predealt hands at duplicate clubs and tournaments. So, on that hand, the double dummy analyzer would tell you that you can only make 3@S. That is technically correct, but what it won't tell you is that you should be in 4@S.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bbasically you should pretty much ignore what they say on the print outs. The analysis is based on their looking at all 52 cards. If we always could look at all 52 cards then they would be valid, but we obviously can't. We have to base our bidding and play on probabilities and the 26 cards we can see (plus the auction and what the opps play).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just because the analysis says you can or cannot make a certain contract, that does not mean much. I suggest you ignore the analysis and try to analyze the hand yourself only looking at your hand and pards to see what contract you should be in.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2 points on this hand:
a) Sandy has a clear 1@S overcall which means her partner would lead a spade and 3NT makes 10 as clubs are behaving.
b) Judy should count her tricks and lose her losers early.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once she gets a club lead, she can count 1 spade tricks, 5 heart tricks, and 3 club tricks for sure. That is 9 easy tricks. However, she still has all suits stopped so she might as well set up 2 diamond tricks for a sure 11 tricks and perhaps 12 if clubs break.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This sets up 3 heart tricks for Sandy. As it turns out declarer always has 9 tricks - 1 heart, 4 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. But at least by playing @H9 declarer only makes 3.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she plays the @h9, declarer either ducks (giving Sandy 3 heart tricks right away) or takes the Jack. If declarer plays the Jack right away, when Sandy cashes the @HA the @HQ falls and the HK and H10 are good. It is hard to visualize that but it is possible to do so.|

pg| ***** 149 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is what Judy needs to think. What Sandy is betting on, when she bids over a preempt, is that on average Judy will have about half of the points remaining.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The preempter on average will have 7ish points. Sandy has 14. So between North and East there are around 18ish points and Judy on average will have 8 or 9. That is part of the reason why it is ok for Sandy to bid.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if Judy has 10 or more she can raise. But if she only has 7 or 8, unless she has good heart support and some distribution (such as club shortness) she must pass. As it is, she has a worse hand than average. Only 6 HCP, 2 hearts, and the dubious @CQ.|mb|p|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a little more than vin ordinaire - not too tricky, but it can go down without a decisive plan. |
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|^b@2
When East opens, we don't want to make just an overcall. Our hand is too nice for that, so instead we double, planning to show our own suit on our next bid. We do. North (good partner that he is) recognizes that we've got the Big Double, and has just enough to raise us to game. |
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^b@2
When we count our losers, we see two Hearts, two Diamonds and one Club. We can easily ruff two Diamonds in Dummy, keeping our loser count under control. BUT. We're going to have to play this hand in the right order. We will need to ruff those Diamonds in dummy before pulling trumps. |
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The other mistake we can make is to carelessly ruff a Diamond LOW in dummy. There's no reason. We don't have a count on the Diamond suit, and East could easily have three, but why risk it? We've got all the high trumps. Be safe and show style. |

The answer is: there would be no way to avoid four minor-suit losers! You would go one down.|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |

If you discard a Diamond loser from dummy on the first trick, you lose an 'unnecessary' Heart trick. Yes, but you will then be able to discard another Diamond from dummy on the established @HK. Instead of losing two Diamonds and two Clubs, you will lose one Heart and two Clubs. Great! |
