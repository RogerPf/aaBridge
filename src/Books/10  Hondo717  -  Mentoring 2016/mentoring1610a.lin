^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss how to keep track of trump. Some people like to count how many have been played. But an easier way to keep track of trumps is to just remember how many are out.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this hand for example, N/S started with 5 trump. After the heart finesse, N/S played 2 leaving 3 out. Once I ruffed that left 2 out which were taken care of by the @HA and @HQ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand was well played. The bidding was reasonable but I do have some comments. East has a tough call. Once I open 1@H East's hand is not as good as it looks because partner is known to be short in hearts and the hearts are behind East.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So what would normally be a nice 5-card suit now loses much of its value. And although it is ok to make a cue bid limit raise with 3-card support I prefer not to do that with 3 small cards. However, I think 2@H is fine.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West clearly wants to be in at least game and possibly slam. But the problem is, any bid below 3S (3@C) is a game try not a slam try.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I play that any bid above 3@S is a control bid and a slam try. Playing that way, I would bid 4@C with the West hand. However most people would play that as a splinter.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So given west doesn't play that, I would either bid 4@H with the West hand or launch right into 4NT. Once East supports spades, the West hand becomes huge. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The only problem being that bidding slam once there is an opening bid by an opponent is rare. West has 21 Bergen Declarer Points. Close to slam. Since East has at least 10. So 4N over 2@H is not unreasonable.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And once East bid 4@S showing more than a min, now 4N is very reasonable. I think East should bid only 3@S. I consider East's hand a very min limit raise.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In that case perhaps West will stop at 4@S which is a lot safer. If spades don't behave, 5@S could be down.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That hand was difficult to play. Let us make several comments.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West can count 2 diamonds 2 spades and 1 club off the top. That's 5 tricks.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The @D9 lead indicates that South has the @DQ because North would not normally lead the @D9 from @DQ98. Also, it is unlikely I have the doubleton @DQ, but it is possible. Therefore, I would win the @DA and play a spade hoping to set up 1 or even 2 spades.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Unfortunately, both the clubs and spades finesses lose and at best  it would be for down 2.|

PG| ***** 116 ***** |

Plan your play.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|^b@2
You might think there's not much to go on here except to try for a 2-2 Spade split (eight ever, nine never!) and if that fails, fall back on the Club finesse. 

Two chances are better than one, right?|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Well yes, sure. But there might be a way in which you can manage your opponents to lead a Club for you. Which opponent would you like for that to happen?|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^b@2
No doubt you would very much prefer if your Left Hand Opponent lead a Club for you around to your Ace-jack combination. How could you manage for that to happen?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Your first move now should be to eliminate both red suits before you can move onto the final stage of playing a Spade to your ten. It is safer to play on Hearts before Diamonds as it is unlikely for anyone to have started off with a singleton Heart.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Well, if you have been watching, your LH opponent has high-lowed in diamonds, and your RH opponent has low-highed. This is consistent with LH opponent having four (even number) diamonds to East's three (odd number).|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^b@2 
Diamonds cannot really be 2-5 since East would have been pretty strange to give a weird odd-numbered count of seven-then-eight when holding @d10 8 7 4 3.|

(A compelling reason might be that an opponent had bid your best suit. Another might be that partner had bid a different suit. Neither applies here). The @S7 looks obvious. And is.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Dummy has a fair hand (11 points) but is not too intimidating. What may cheer you up a little is that dummy only has two little Spades. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This gives you hope that partner will have either the @SA or the @SQ to help establish your suit. Of course, if declarer has the @SA Q 10 he will win trick one cheaply (with the @S10) and be off to a flyer.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Do you know the Spade layout? (Essentially, who has what in Spades?) If you lead the @SK next will that make all your Spades winners?|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NLet us move to another panel and illustrate the Spade layout as we know it so far. |
pg| ***** 178 ***** |

You started with these 5 spades.|md|SKJ872,,,|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Dummy had these two spades.|md|0,s63,0,0|

NT|^B@2
and Declarer played the two spades--@S10 4.|md|0,0,0,st4|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


nt||AT|^B@2
Therefore, after two rounds of spades, the current Spade layout could either be like what we see it here and the Spades will run if you play the @SK.|md|SK87,0,s5,sq|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


nt||AT|^B@2
Or the current Spade layout could be as we see it now and declarer has a Spade stopper.|md|SK87,0,0,sq5|

NT||AT|^B@2
How can you tell?|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can't. You have to cash the @SK and await your fate. If partner follows, though, you will know the @SQ is going to fall.|
