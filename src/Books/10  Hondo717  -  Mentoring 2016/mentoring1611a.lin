^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss when responder should bid over a double. It is what as known as a "free bid" because even if responder passes, opener still will get a chance to bid. Some people think you should only make a "free bid" with an intermediate or better hand. But that is not really best. Responder should make a bid if they have something "useful" to say. It means showing a long and/or strong suit.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One obvious bid is raising partner. Partner should pass with a weakish balanced hand. In this case I have 2 choices and pass is not one of them. I will bid 1@S. On the other hand 3@C would not be completely unreasonable because preemptive bids are often effective.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But I decided showing a nice spade suit is more important, despite the fact that the double by East will make it more likely she has 4 spades. 2@D is reasonable but in general you should prefer to bid a major when you can. So if I were West I would have bid 2@H.|mb|1S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The defense:
At TRICK 3, it's not totally obvious, but West should hesitate to discard a club. West knows East is short in clubs because of the takeout double which means south is long in clubs. West should throw long diamonds (since there is a known 8 card fit) and that would probably hold me to 2.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should also consider bidding 3 diamonds although it is not 100% clear that West has 5 diamonds. The fact that West freely bid 2D makes it more likely. Had I passed and West bid 2@D it would have been less likely.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding: 
As I mentioned, I would have opened 2@S with the West hand. Many players would not for 2 reasons.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One is (to which I don't agree) that you should not open a weak 2 with a 4-card major and the other reason is their spade suit lacked high honors. But actually that spade suit is quite good for offense It has lots of intermediate cards (the @S10, @S9, @S7). They will take no tricks on defense. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So contrary to what you may have heard, having the A or K in a preempt suit is not as good as you might think because they are likely to take a trick. The ideal suit to preempt with is headed by the QJ10.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not saying you shouldn't preempt with an ace or king. I am just saying it is not as beneficial as you might think. Had West opened 2@S, then East would have bid 4@S which they ended up in the same place.|

It turns out West was premature in cashing the @SA. If West is patient and leads something other than a spade after winning the @C10 the contract will go down.|

It is hard to know when to be "passive" and when to be aggressive when defending. In this case passive works better.|

No guesswork was involved. As declarer, you needed to count the West hand. You could place him with 6 hearts for his opening bid of 2@h. He showed up with one spade and two diamonds. His shape was therefore 1=6=2=4. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |

He started with four clubs and it was therefore right to finesse him for the @cJ on the fourth round of the suit.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This is a fair contract but no more. In terms of top tricks there are eleven (to wit: one spade, three hearts, four diamond and three clubs). If we can make four heart tricks then the contract will succeed. What is the best play in hearts?|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Taking the heart suit in isolation you should cash the @HA and @HK and lead towards the @HQ 10. |
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Assuming that both opponents have followed with small cards it is better to go up with the @HQ. This way you will make four tricks whenever the suit breaks 3-3, whenever either opponent has @HJ x or when RHO has a singleton (so that there is a marked finesse). |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|6NT is the spot here - a decent contract that appears to hang on the Heart suit coming in for four tricks. |
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The French commentator suggested that West would naturally lead the @SK and that the right play is to duck it (completely correct). After this, just running off all the minor suit winners would squeeze the life out of West.|
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I agree with this analysis entirely - except that I think that the @SK lead is dangerous against 6NT bid in this fashion. If you reverse the @SJ and @SA that lead would give away the contract trivially. |
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I was West on this hand and led a Club - so I have set this deal up in the way the hand was played at the table.|
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the play is not so easy. Declarer looked at the ceiling for inspiration, cashed all his winners and eventually, with suspicious glances at both of his opponents, took the percentage line in Hearts and played for the drop. One down. What did he miss?|
PG| ***** 258 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, in these hands it would have cost him nothing to have ducked a Spade early on. Apart from the unlikely possibility of finding an opponent with @SK Q alone he would have found a squeeze position if either opponent hand started with the @SK Q and four Hearts to the @HJ (as here). |
PG| ***** 259 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, ducking a trick early (to rectify the count, as it's known) might have also enabled declarer to count the hand in certain layouts and enabled him to finesse in Hearts in the endgame. Not on this layout, of course, but on others.|
PG| ***** 260 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you not au fait (French again – remember where we are!) with squeezes and find them difficult this hand is a good one to help you understand the basic techniques. |
PG| ***** 261 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In essence, you should be one trick short of your contract and should have lost all the tricks necessary before you run your winners. |
PG| ***** 262 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That's over-simplifying matters but here you can see the effect of ducking a Spade and of not ducking a Spade early. If you just play off your winners West doesn't have to throw away one of his winners in the endgame. |

PG| ***** 271 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The lead surely places all the Diamond honors with West, doesn't it? The @DK promises a suit backed up by the @DQ and (probably) the @DJ as well. Anyway, West would have to be a mug to come into the auction with a poor suit.|

You are in dummy for the first and last time and this is the only opportunity you have to take a trump finesse.|
PG| ***** 285 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
In no way shape or form could it be right to lead the @SQ. This is not a genuine finesse - it is a pseudo-finesse.|
PG| ***** 286 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If you tried to lead a Heart then that's the right play but you mustn't lead a small one. If the trump finesse works, you would end up in your hand with the @HJ. |

NT|^B@2
What would you do then? Play the @HA and pray the @HK drops? On what planet are you that lucky?|

Let's rethink. How about playing the @H10 instead, and letting it ride? Then, if the @H10 holds, you'd know East has the missing @HK, and you could repeat the finesse.|

You can try to sneak an overtrick through (a sneaky low Spade next is your best bet), but that would just be froth on the coffee.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Play. 
West leads the @DK from his lovely sequence and we must pause and take stock in order to Count and Plan.|
PG| ***** 300 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The count of winners and losers (an essential part of declarer-play strategy in suit contracts), shows there to be four potential losers – one in Spades, one in Hearts and two in Diamonds. The only loser we can make disappear is in Hearts – and to do that we require the trump finesse to work.|
PG| ***** 301 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We must win the @DA on the table at trick one (can you see with hindsight how not taking it would be fatal?) and then immediately finesse in Hearts. However, to do that we must lead the @H10 from dummy and not a low Heart. |
PG| ***** 302 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When the @H10 wins the trick we repeat the act by leading a Heart to the Jack. The Ace of trumps brings down the King and we are home and dry.|
PG| ***** 303 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, when should we be thinking about this dandy type of finesse? 
- Entries are a problem. 
- We want to be in the same hand to repeat the finesse. 
- We've got a lot of equal cards.|
PG| ***** 304 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Notice that the only Heart above the @H9 missing is the @HK. That @H10 in dummy is the perfect bait to dangle. If East had covered the @H10 with the @HK then we'd just reap the harvest by bashing it with the @HA. |
PG| ***** 305 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note, as in all finesse positions, that we are on a 50-50 shot. If West had the @HK, we'd be going down. That's the way the cookie crumbles. |
