^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see if East can and should do better. For top tricks, 3 clubs, 2 hearts, and 2 spades. That is seven tricks. East needs 2 more.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Possibilities are an extra heart trick, an extra spade trick, or an extra diamond trick. Also with 5 diamonds can set up 3 diamond tricks perhaps. Therefore, I would just lead a low diamond at trick 2.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If diamonds are 3-2, then East will lose the @DA and @DQ and score 3 diamond tricks giving East 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 hearts, and 2 spades for 10 tricks. That is the easiest way to play the hand. Remember always count your tricks and come up with a plan when you can to take the number of tricks you need.|

onenoDavid:  Howard - do you advise some minimum suit for weak 2 opening - like 2 of top 3 honors?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I basically think you should open a weak 2 whenever you have 5-10 points and a 6-card suit regardless of how strong your suit is. That is my style. Others have different styles. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, if you wait for a suit with 2 of 3 top honors, you will forgo opening a lot of effective weak-Twos. If you want to play you need 2 honors and at least 3 HCP that would be OK (the 10 is an honor). But I wouldn't put many more restrictions than that. I also do not agree with those who won't open weak 2s with an outside 4-card major or a void.|

pg| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You only need a 5-card suit to bid 2@S and you have a very good 5-card suit. BTW, Marty Bergen says "any suit with 4 honors should be treated as 1 card longer than it really is." I think that is a bit of an overstatement,  but it does mean you should love suits with 4 honors.|ub||
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


mb|2S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My only question is whether North should bid 2@S or 3@S. Note that 3@S is NOT a preempt. You do not preempt over a preempt. 3@S shows a very good hand with a self-sufficient suit (meaning it plays OK opposite a singleton), North has the suit, and the singleton heart is great, but is about 2 or 3 points short of a 3@S bid. Regardless, I would not hate 3@S bid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, we probably make 4@S if we get the diamonds right. And you would normally play the non-weak 2 bidder for all cards outside of hearts. Because the preempter is short in the other 3 suits. Meaning it is more likely that their partner has any missing honors you are looking for.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The reason 4@S makes is because we have a great fit -- no wasted heart points (other than the @HJ). We take five spades, four diamonds, and one club. But that shows you that the North hand despite only having 14 HCP is better than its HCP indicates by quite a bit once there is a heart preempt.|

KIWI_2o1:  I don't want to risk a takeout double even in 4th position.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand the problem with double. Partner may jump in spades. So unless partner jumps to 4@S (unlikely) the double and correct to NT describes the hand. The hand is too strong to bid 1N immediately.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that, there are 2 schools of thoughts regarding a 2N bid in balancing seat by East. In fact, this topic was covered in a recent unusual NT movie: |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?ndf=unusualNT101^*N|CP||at|.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play 2NT as unusual (including me). Others play 2NT (in balancing seat only) as showing 19-21 or so which would be a nice bid for East on this hand.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, my feeling is that you rarely get a 19-21 point hand in balancing seat after a 1 opener and even if you do, partner rates to have very little. So playing 2NT as unusual, both for consistency and frequency of occurrence, makes more sense. Let me give you an undo.|ub||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played. When you have all the tricks but one you have a potential squeeze. Just play out all your winners, and watch the opponents discards. Sometimes they will either be squeezed (as I was because I could not guard both clubs and spades). Or they will be pseudo squeezed, meaning they will misdiscard even though double dummy they are not squeezed.|

Squeezes are actually pretty easy to pull off. If there is 1 expert technique I suggest you want to learn, it is a squeeze because it is relatively easy to pull off. This tutorial wold be very helpful.|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=squeezes^*N|CP||at|.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out even if I bid only 2@H instead of 3@H, North would bid 2NT and I would jump to 4@H. However, because of my 17 HCP, doubleton spade with the @SK located favorably, and 6 card suit I decided to upgrade my hand. On the other hand, if you chose to bid only 2@H over 2@D, that would be a perfectly acceptable bid (and some of my partners who do not prefer my creativity would like it better :) :).|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|In the protective seat, 1NT is not so strong as it would be in the second seat. It shows around 11-14 HCPs.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The best way of responding to a 1NT overcall is to play exactly the same methods as you would opposite an opening 1NT. So, 2@C is Stayman; 2@D and 2@H are transfer responses.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Dummy goes down and the time has come to make a plan. You have seven top tricks and will need two more tricks from the spade suit. |

NT||lb|*mWho most likely has the Spade King?^East~West^2|NT|^B@2
Only 15 points are missing, so the odds are high that West holds the @SK as part of his opening bid. You should plan to play the spade suit as soon as you get the lead.|

PG| ***** 143 ***** |

Can you see a way to make the game against a different holding in the West seat? You will have to take that fork.|

He will have no heart to play and you will then be able to finesse the @SJ and make the contract when West began with @SK-x-x.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Well, for a start, you are missing two Aces - so 6@S would have been sunk without trace. So much for a slam.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How safe is 5@S (a contract you would have reached had you launched Blackwood)? How should you play 4@S? You need to Count and to make a Plan. Let's count winners and losers.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Spades: Five tricks here and no losers, although you might have to think about a potential bad break; |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Hearts: Two (slow) winners, one loser; |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Diamonds: One obvious loser - maybe two of them. Much depends on where the @DA resides; |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Clubs: Three obvious winners, no losers. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In terms of winners, then, you have five Spades, two Hearts and three Clubs. That's ten.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In terms of losers, you have no Spades (barring a bad break), one Heart and one or two Diamonds. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Why is it important to play the @SA (or @SK - they are equals) and not cash the @SQ first?|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


NT||lb|*yIs it actually important?^^Y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Cashing a top Spade from hand is (or might be) important. The only real danger to your contract comes from the possibility of a 4-0 trump break. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By cashing the @SA first, you can see the lie of the land and deal with either of the opposition miscreants who may have started with @SJ x x x. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |

This play is known as a precaution play or a discovery play.|
