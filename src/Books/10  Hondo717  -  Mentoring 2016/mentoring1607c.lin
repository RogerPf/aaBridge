^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a good illustration of the Law of Total Tricks. EW have 11 trump and LOTT says bidding 5 is ok. Admittedly, the law is not as accurate at the 5-level and higher, but it is very accurate at the 1-4 levels.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, it turns out we can make 4 spades, losing 1 diamond, 1 spade and 1 heart. So 5@H is a very good bid. Note that despite the fact that EW have "only" 21 HCP, they can make 4, and NS can make 4 holding "only" 19 HCP. Remember, HCP are only one factor in deciding how good your hand is. And they are overrated by most players.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Fit and distribution are also important, sometimes more so, as on this hand. That is why the Law of Total Tricks works. It takes into account fit and distribution. So whenever your partner overcalls and you have 4-card support you can raise to the 3-level since you know you have 9 trump. Don't worry about how many HCP you have.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
CATazzie:  Do you care about vulnerability when using LOTT to bid?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My answer is no in general. If you are vul and have a flat hand then perhaps you are a bit more cautious. But most people are overly cautious so I hate to even put in that qualifier.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lucky in clubs. I probably should have bid Michaels. The problem with major suit Michaels is that it is ambiguous in that your 2nd suit is not known. In fact, some experts now have other bids to show exact 2 suited hands. For example, they would play something called "top bottom" and "top top" where 2@S by me (normally Michaels) would show the 2 top unbid suits (hearts and diamonds).|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3@C by me, rather than being a preempt would show "top bottom" the top and bottom suits (hearts and clubs on this hand). Not saying you should play it, as you lose the ability to preempt in clubs, but that approach has become more popular.|

PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So I would have bid a forcing 1NT, intending to bid 3@S over whatever West responded, to show a 3-card limit raise. On the other hand, the AJ of spades are good cards because they fit with partner I think 2@D is reasonable as well. There is a lot of judgement in bridge. I try to teach you basic judgment principles. But each person has to apply them based on their personality and preferences.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with 1@S, but if North wanted to open 2@C that would be possible. You open 2@C when you have 9 tricks and at least 4 Quick Tricks. North has 5 1/2 quick tricks. That is very rare.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let me renew my discussion about "Quick Trick Points" from a few months ago. I evaluate my "Quick Trick" points when I have a decision to make about how good my hand is.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Each suit can have up to 2 Quick Tricks for a total of 8 quick tricks and since there are 40 HCP I estimate a Quick Trick as being worth 40 divided by 8 = 5 points. So my "Quick Trick" points are my number of Quick Tricks times 5.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Then I compare my "quick trick points" with my HCP. If my "Quick Trick Points" are higher than my HCP, I upgrade my hand. If my "Quick Trick" points are lower, than I downgrade my hand. On this hand North has 5.5 Quick Tricks which are worth 27.5 Quick Trick points, but she has only 20 HCP.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That means her hand is much better than her HCP indicate. So that would be a reason to open 2@C on a marginal hand. Now let us count her tricks, because she is supposed to have 9 tricks. With North's hand that is a little harder.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The way you count tricks with long suits is assume partner has an "average number" of low cards in your long suit. So with a 5 card suit, the 3 other hands have 8 cards in the suit between the 3 of them--2 2/3 cards in the suit.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With North's diamond suit, if partner had 3 cards in the suit, it would be worth 4 tricks (assuming a 3-2 break). If partner had only 2 cards in the suit, it would be worth 3 tricks (assuming the most likely 4-2 break).|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would personally count diamonds as being worth 3.5 tricks. Maybe a smidge more. Spades are a little messier. Missing the @SKJ means you could lose a lot of tricks. But with an average length of 7 2/3 spades between the 2 hands, I would count spades as being worth 3 tricks.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
All of this is obviously an estimate, and the North hand is very hard to estimate in terms of the number of tricks. However, she has 8.5 tricks not quite 9, but I still love the 5.5 quick tricks.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, it is often awkward to open 2 suited hands 2@C. Why?|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


AT| Because you are starting at a higher level and it is harder to describe the hand. So I would probably open the North hand 1@S as North did. Today there seem to be a lot of ambiguous decisions :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is should I bid 2@S. Again its close. I only have 5 HCP and 4-3-3-3 distribution both negatives. I like my @SKJ, but I dislike my @CJ with no other honors. I think pass is best, but again, if you chose to bid 2@S I would not think that is wrong. Just not what I would do though on this hand 2@S would have worked out much better, as 4@S is cold.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely done all around both bidding and play. Now let me expand upon specific kings.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should only do a king ask if you have all the key cards and the trump queen because the king ask not only asks for kings but asks partner to bid 7 if he has a nice source of tricks outside the trump suit.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now here is the issue with specific kings when the trump suit is not spades. Suppose you have a specific king that is higher than the trump suit. For example suppose on this hand I had the @SK but not the @DK.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Do I bid 6@S going past 6@H or not?|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|
I think the answer should be that yes you should. The 5NT bidder must be prepared for any specific king bid. However, in this case there is a solution.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play "kickback" RKCB you solve the problem. You use 4@S as RKCB rather than 4NT when hearts are trump. The main advantage is it allows for a queen ask when responder shows 0 or 3 key cards as the response.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play 4NT as RKCB when hearts as trump then responder would bid 5@D to show 0 or 3 (assuming you are playing 1430). Now suppose the 4NT bidder is missing 1 key card and does not have the @HQ. The 4NT bidder has no way of finding out whether responder has the @HQ or not. So they have to guess whether or not to bid 6.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if you play 4@S as RKCB the problem goes away. Responder bids 5@C to show 0 or 3 (4N would show 1 or 4) and then the 4@S bidder can bid 5@D to ask for the @HQ without going past 5@H if responder does not have the @HQ.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is the main reason to play kickback. But this hand shows a 2nd reason if you play specific kings. The kickback bidder can bid 5@S to ask about specific kings and the responder can bid 5N to show the @SK
hondo717:  (6@H would deny any kings so 5N is an idle bid that can be used to show the @SK).|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That would solve the problem (although on this hand it happens to make it much harder to get to 7).|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|When I say "Count", I don't mean Dracula! Boot Campers often moan about how much there is to count in bridge: Points, shape, how many cards have been played in each suit, how many trumps are still out, how many cards and points each player has, and on and on and on. Whine, whine, whine.
|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But you know what? It isn't that hard (or only nine people on earth would be able to play this game). Usually if you can focus on just ONE count (in addition to trumps!), you can make or set the hand. In this example, your job is fairly easy. Your Left Hand Opponent will open 1NT. If you can count his High Card Points, you can find the missing Queen.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NYou and partner have 22 HCP. Give West 16 HCP (the middle of 15-17). That leaves one or two for East. For now you are going to lose three heart tricks.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNo. West cannot have both. That will be 18 HCP - @HAKQ, @CQJ, @DA, and @SQ. So he must have only one of the two - either the @SQ or @DA. He must have the @DA because he would not open 1N with 14 HCP - or highly unlikely.|
