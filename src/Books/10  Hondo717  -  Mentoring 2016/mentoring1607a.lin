Now the clubs are all good. He ends up taking 5 clubs, 5 hearts in his hand, plus a spade ruff for 11 tricks. That is not the only way to play it, but it is a reasonable way. The way he played it Tom burned his entry to the board by playing the trumps plus he lost control of spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, as I mentioned on defense, taking the @DA was a reasonable play, but then Ben should play spades. If he assumes pard has 4 spades, he can work out that Tom has 2 spades left and they take the @HQ, @DA, and 2 spades for down 1.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So they made 3N. They were lucky with the diamonds but unlucky with the clubs. It is basically on the diamond finesse if clubs break normally. It is not a game I hate missing, but I also would not mind being there. In general I am not a big fan of playing in 2NT. It is only right in IMPs if you make exactly 2. Otherwise, the reward for making 3N outweighs the risk of going down a trick.|

PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With Tom's hand I would have bid 3@C.|mb|3cp|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |

PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Tom should then probably bid 3@S, showing a spade card but no heart stopper.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I probably bid 5 in IMPs and 4 in Match Points. And on a good day, if clubs break no worse than 3-1 they will lose 1 diamond and 1 heart.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even if the diamond finesse loses, Tom's spade loser will be discarded on the @DQ.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
chase1340:  How do you know 3@H is asking for a Heart stopper?|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In a competitive auction, where no fit has been found and the opponents have bid a suit a cue bid is asking about a stopper in that suit. With a stopper Ken would bid 3N himself. The only exception to that is that if you are responder and there is an overcall (e.g. 1@H-2@C-?) then a cue bid (3@C in this example) shows a limit raise or better. But otherwise a cue bid asks for a stopper.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
WestElsdon:  If i bid 3@C and Ben bids 3@H, then what does Ken do?|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Ben bids 3@H, then Ken cannot bid 3N since he does not have a heart stopper. I would bid 3@S personally. That is an expert bid that I don't expect you to use. But, Ken can't have spades having not bid 2@S over 2@D. So 3@S is showing a spade card and letting Tom bid 3N with a partial heart stopper like @HQxx.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, North led the @H2. That shows exactly 4 hearts. I have 3 hearts, dummy has 2. So West has 4 hearts  and no more than 3 spades. Sometimes that information can be useful.|pc|H6|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading away from my @HA was a good defensive technique to know. When you have the Ace and see the kinging on the board and if you think there is a chance partner has the Queen you should underlead your Ace to give declarer a guess. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss when to open 2@C. You use 2 criteria.
a) you must have 9 tricks in your hand (assuming pard has average distribution in your long suits and 
b) you must have 4 quick tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East only has 8 sure tricks (7 hearts and a spade) some chance that the @SQ or @CK might be a 9th trick. So give east 8.5 tricks.

Further, East has 3 quick tricks (@HAK plus @SA). So personally I would not open 2@C, but it certainly is not a bad choice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play West should bid 2@H with a bust over 2@C, but the problem with that is illustrated by this hand. It will end up wrong siding the contract. I recommend you play what is called 2nd negative or cheaper minor.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a slight twist but it is essentially the same thing. I always bid 2@D even with a bust  hand and then if the 2@C opener bids 2@H or 2@S, if I bid 3@C, that shows a bust hand. Therefore, in my style 2@C-2@D-2@H or 2@S-3@C shows that responder has no aces or kings. |
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, some play that if it goes 2@C-2@D-3@C-3@D that also shows a bust hand. But I don't play that because a) it is relatively rare that opener bids 3@C and it is sometimes awkward to not be able to bid 3@D when responder has a good hand.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I play only 3@C shows the bust hand over 2@H or 2@S. And there is no way to show a bust hand if opener rebids 3@C. However, many people play that 3@D over 3@C shows the bust. Regardless, I think the "cheaper minor/2nd negative" approach is better than 2@H over 2@C as a bust.|

cs||fp||cp|8|AT|^b@2^*BLarry Cohen|CP||AT|^*N:This is the final quiz in this 3-part series. In the earlier sections, we discussed taking out low and high level takeout doubles. Here, three more topics are introduced:|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||
%%%%example A
qx||st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|2S42  H2  DAJ876  CKT765,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|What to do? - Example A|ah|Taking out to 4NT.|mb|4HDP?|NT|^B@2
1) Taking out to 4NT. If the opponents open 4@H or 4@S and partner doubles, what are you to bid with, say 5-5 in the minors?|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||lb|*bFor example what would you bid with this hand?^^4n|AT|^B@2
Fortunately, 4NT shows this kind of hand (it is not practical for it to be natural or Blackwood). Partner will pick his best/longest minor. (Note: For experienced players, if the opening is 4@S and you takeout partner's double to 4NT you are showing any 2 suits -- not necessarily both minors).|mb|!4n|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT||
%%example B
qx||st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|2SK32  H32  DKT87  CAJ54,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|What to do? - Example B|ah|Their responder acts|mb|2HD3H?|NT|^B@2
Their responder acts after the takeout double.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid with this hand?^^3s|NT|^B@2
South now has the option of passing with a bad hand. So, if he bids (say 3@S), he is showing values. A "freebid" shows about 8-11 points. What if South doubles? I recommend playing that as "responsive." This means "not penalty." It is card/value showing. |mb|!3S|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even if their raise is to game (say 4@H on the auction above), double is still not "penalty" and would be the correct call with the hand just given.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT||
%%%
%%example C
qx||st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|2,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|What to do - Example C|AH|Lebensohl|NT|^B@2
3. Lebensohl.
This is a convention that most experts use. I recommend it only for very experienced players with good memories. It works like this:|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


MB|2SXP?|NT|^B@2
The 2NT bid is conventional (and alertable). It does not mean that South wants to play in 2NT. It means (usually) that he has a weak hand. It request that the doubler bid 3@C. The 2NT bidder can then pass (to play in 3@C) or correct to 3@D or 3@H to play there. With a better hand, he bids directly on the 3 level (without going through 2NT first).  |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are many finer points and variations to this convention--this is just the basic overview. The downside of Lebensohl is that the partner of the doubler can no longer bid 2NT natural.

For the purpose of this quiz, assume your are NOT playing Lebensohl. Next are quizzes to test how much did you learn.|

Call 2N. Happy to have this available as Natural (if you were playing the Lebensohl convention, you wouldn't have this option--and would probably bid 3@C value-showing). Given that 2NT is natural, that is a better description than 3@C.|

Bid 3@H. You aren't strong enough for 4@H. You would like to bid 3 1/2@H if that were legal. This is why Lebensohl is useful (your 3@H here would show this kind of hand; with a weaker hand you'd bid 2NT first and after partner's forced 3@C you'd bid 3@H weak). However, life can go on without this convention. If you don't have it available, just bid 3@H and hope for the best.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|If partner held @H9-8-6-3, the usual agreement is to signal with the second highest card (the @H8). Here he has played the @H9. In any case, you would have no chance of beating the contract if partner held four Hearts and there was only one Heart trick for the defense. So, you must assume that partner holds a doubleton Heart. (A singleton is unlikely because East might then have bid his Hearts). How will you continue the defense?|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose you continued with King and another Heart immediately, giving partner a ruff of dummy's @H10. That would be three tricks for the defense. There would be every chance, though, that declarer could subsequently score six trump tricks, three top cards in the minors and the @HQ. That's a total of ten tricks. The best chance of a fourth trick is that partner holds the @DK and you must switch to a Diamond on this trick.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|This is a defensive problem, so take the South cards. You lead the @HA against East’s contract of 4@S and partner signals with the @H9. How do you continue the defense? |
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^b@2
At the table, South did what comes naturally. He cashed the @HK, North completing his high-low, and led a third round of the suit. "Ten, please," said declarer and North ruffed. The game could no longer be defeated. On any return declarer would pick up North’s @SK and eventually discard his potential Diamond loser on the @HQ. |
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Before rushing to give his partner a Heart ruff, South should have considered where a fourth defensive trick was likely to come from. To beat the game, South needs to switch to a Diamond at Trick 2. Declarer then has no way home.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|As tempting as it may seem to give partner a diamond ruff, or to return the @CK (dummy's weakness in the club suit), we must instead switch to our doubleton spade.
 
We are hoping that our partner has the @SA or @SK, which may just be enough for us to beat this contract.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|It looks as though our foresight has paid off. Our spade switch at trick 2 has enabled the defense to obtain a spade ruff as well as a diamond ruff.
 
This deal has been all about taking our tricks in the right order.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|The contract has been beaten. You can try to beat it by two by leading another diamond (that would make South's 2@H bid a contender for Wacko bid of the year but you never know...!).|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|With five tricks in the bank - and that's all you need - your interest on this deal is slowly fading. The @DK is an exciting card to see but it does look as though declarer has the @DA.
 
It appears that declarer has the remaining tricks - at least, that is what West is mumbling.|
