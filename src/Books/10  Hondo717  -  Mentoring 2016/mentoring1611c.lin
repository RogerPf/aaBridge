PG| ***** 1 ***** |

The danger is, especially if you have a weakish hand with 4 hearts, that if you get a 1@S overcall, you may lose your heart fit. So I will bypass diamonds sometimes if I am worried about that.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 6@C is a very good contract but hard to bid after my 3@S bid. Having said that, I think West should bid 5@C not 4@C. But I don't think East should bid 6@C even if West bids 5@C. East's hand is about average to what West expects.|

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct. I don't think East has a 6@C bid over 5@C. Once an opponent preempts, a lot of bidding room is gone, so you have to play the percentages. The percentages say that after a preempt, when you have an opening hand or even a little better, partner rates to average around 8 points or so. And so East has about what partner should expect.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West brings up an interesting question. Can she double and then correct to 5@C to show a good hand.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is problematic. Suppose it goes 3@S-Dbl-4@S-?. Now East has every right to expect that West has hearts and will bid 5 hearts with length in hearts and that is not what West want to hear. It is very hard to get to slam after a preempt.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a bridge expression that says "once you are fixed, stay fixed." It means that you are the victim of a bad board due to the opponents bidding. On this hand slam is unlikely in general, even after a preempt. So you just give up on slam and try to find the best game you can.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sometimes you will miss a slam, but if you try for slam on marginal hands, you will go down a lot when you can make a game. So it is better to accurately bid games and not worry about missing slams after a preempt. In the long run you will do better.|

{  Simple Transfer to Minors  }

|fp||CP||CS||at|The transfer to minors can be used for two purposes:|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT|

a) to allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|
  
b) to play in three of a minor with five or fewer points and a 6-card minor.

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|^B@2^Y@3
Most partnerships play Jacoby Transfers for major suits. However, interested players may use Jacoby Transfers for the minors as well. First, let me explain the benefits of transfers in minors.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|

In general, if you have a weak hand with a long suit opposite a strong hand, it is more desirable to play in the weak hand's suit because in that suit, the long cards will take tricks, whereas in another suit it may not be possible to score the low cards in the weak hand's long suit. The only trade off is you have to play at the three level, which is kind of high. However, given a weak hand with seven clubs or diamonds, the trade off is worth it.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


AT|

Some partnerships play 2@S as a transfer to minors. Opener automatically responds 3@C. The partner bidding the transfer passes with clubs or corrects to 3@D. That is easier to play, but not quite as flexible. I recommend you start with this simpler transfer and then progress to the stronger and more flexible version which I will explain next. Let me first show you a few examples of the simple transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT|

BTW, all "transfer bids" should be alerted. Further both "accepted" and "rejected" response bids by the NT opener should be alerted as these are additional information available to the partnership that opponents should be aware of. To economize his time, the Movie Maker has not included the alerts in the following examples. Please consider it done in every situation. In all example you are using 2@S to transfer to MINOR(s).|

^-|fp||CP||CS||AT|^B@2
One variant of Jacoby that I use is 4-suit Jacoby transfer. A 2@S bid by responder is a transfer to clubs, and a 2NT bid is a transfer to diamonds. Since there are two bids between the transfer bid and the transfer suit, opener now has two choices. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT|

With good support (ONLY if you have 1 of the top 3 honors, regardless of the length of your support), opener "accepts" the transfer by bidding the suit (1NT-2@S-3@C or 1NT-2NT-3@d). BTW, Notrumper always has at least 2-card support.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT|
 
With less than good support, opener "rejects" the transfer by not bidding the transfer suit (1NT-2@S-2NT or 1NT-2NT-3@C). |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|

Again, this convention can be used for two purposes:
1. To allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit if opener accepts the transfer. Otherwise, the contract will be 3 of the minor.

2. To play in 3 of a minor with 5 or fewer points and a 6-card minor.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|

As an important clarification. If you play 4-suit Jacoby transfer you cannot make a 2NT invitational bid. In another word, 1N-P-2N is not invitational bid. In its place you bid Stayman followed by 2NT. Now we have to 1NT bidder should be alert to the following:
^C1NT-2@C-2@S-2NT does not necessarily promise hearts and simply shows a 2N invite.
^C1NT-2@C-2@H-2N denies 4 spades by responder and simply shows a 2N invite. 
^B@2If responder bids Stayman with an invitational hand and 4 spades, he must bid 2@S when opener responds 2@H (e.g. the auction should go 1N-2@C-2@H-2@S).|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This version of Transfer to Minors is very powerful but can be confusing because the traditional invitational 2NT bid by responder no longer is available. To make an invitational raise to 2N (since a direct 2N is a diamond transfer), you bid Stayman first and then 2N. Therefore, if responder bids Stayman, on rare occasions she will not have  a 4-card major. You should have a thorough discussion with your partner if you would like to use this version of transfer to minors.|

^-|HT|c|cp||FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, it is usually much harder to take nine tricks than seven tricks. And three of a minor requires that you take nine tricks whereas 1N requires you only have to take seven tricks. Therefore, unless you are pretty sure you are going to take three more tricks in a minor-suit contract than in NT, you should not transfer. (If you take two more tricks in a minor-suit contract, you break even.) So, how do you know if a minor-suit contract will yield three more tricks? |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


AT|

Well, you don't. But here are some guidelines that work pretty well. If you have a 7-card minor and a weak hand, transfer. If you have a 6-card minor and shortness somewhere (a singleton or void) and a weak hand, transfer. Otherwise, don't bother.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


AT| 

By the way, this is essentially the same logic as to why you strongly prefer to play 3N as opposed to 5 of a minor. It is much easier to take nine tricks than eleven.|

^Ca) I should bid 3N with a spade stopper.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT|^B@2

^Cb) Absent a spade stopper I can bid 4@C most of the time and occasionally 5@C which is what I am going to do on this hand because I know we have no club losers. And we have at most 2 spade losers.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And I figure at worst 5@C will be on a red suit finesse, and could easily be cold. On the other hand, since East doubled I do have 2 more choices than I would had she not doubled-- pass and redouble. I won't bother to discuss what they mean, but a serious partnership might want to assign those extra bids meanings as well.|

North would not ask me to bid 3N unless she knew clubs were running. So I know we have clubs covered.|

As you see, East's double worked out well because now West can lead the @SA with little fear of it setting up a trick for our side. It is likely that East's double shows the @SK.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. Once again proving that if you follow the law of total tricks (e.g bid 3@S with the known 9-card fit) you will be right more often than not. And note that EW can probably make 3@D--losing 1 spade 1 heart and no more than 2 diamonds and perhaps 1.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So even down 1 in 3@S, which is what would happen with perfect defense would still be a good result. The moral of the story is always follow the Law of Total Tricks. You will be right almost all of the time.|

NT|^B@2
On this auction you should think 1N bid says nothing about diamonds (even though I happen to have diamonds on this hand). So, because I have such a nice spade stopper and I am worried about a 2@C rebid, I am going to bid 1N.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |

I could be missing a heart fit, but, unless we miss game, 1N might be just as good as 2@H even if we have a heart fit. And if I double and partner rebids clubs, I have a problem. But if you chose to double, that would be fine.|mb|1N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is how many hearts should I bid. At this vul, I like 3@H better than 2@H. But if you want to bid 2@H, a) because your hearts are not that strong and b) because you have some defense that would be fine.|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But since I like to preempt, and the vul is favorable (we are not and they are), I choose 3@H. BTW, another argument against bidding 3@H is my flat distribution given my 7-card suit.|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Any time your distribution in your 3 shortest suits is as flat as it can be (e.g. you have no singletons or voids) that is a minus. But I am still bidding 3@H because I am an unrepentant preempter :).|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |

PG| ***** 191 ***** |

I am leading the @H10 as a suit preference signal asking for a diamond back. A high heart asks for a diamond the higher suit. A low heart asks for the clubs the lower suit. A middle heart says I have no preference.|pc|HT|

PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So my 3@H bid put pressure on West. If I bid 2@H then West probably bids just 2@S. West could decide she has a limit raise, but with a flat 10, including points in hearts and only 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would make the conservative 2@S bid. In that case East would pass and I would have to decide whether or not to bid 3@H. If I did, then West might decide to double.|

NT|^B@2
That would show some heart cards but not that strong a hand given West only bid 2@S. nd I am not sure what I would do with the East hand if West doubled. With the @HQ and flat distribution and  2 aces I might very well pass.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|East is now a safe hand; he has no spades left. You can therefore run the @DQ into the East hand. Even if this loses, you will be OK. East will have no spade to play and the @DJ will be established as your ninth trick.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|You must not think of taking a finesse! If it lost, West would score three spade tricks and beat the contract. You have nine tricks ready to go and should therefore rise with the @HA and cash those tricks.|
