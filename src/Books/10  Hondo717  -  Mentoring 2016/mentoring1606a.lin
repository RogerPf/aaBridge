^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not a terrible contract. if spades behave (50% that the jack comes down in 2 or 3 rounds) then 8 sure tricks and guess which finesse to take for the 9th trick. So I think EW should be in 3NT particularly in IMPs it is always right to stretch to bid close games. I very much like Kia's 3NT bid.|

NT||sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is probably the best lead given the auction. On this auction, Tom is showing an unbalanced hand with 5+ diamonds and 4 spades. So a diamond by Kia would not be a good lead and neither would a spade be a good lead. It is barely possible I have 4 smallish hearts and the @HK might be right, but that is doubtful. So the unbid suit of clubs seems best, although it works out well for me.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hard to say. This is not necessarily a 2nd hand low situation because the @CA would capture the @CQ. The reason to play 2nd hand low in general is that you want your honors to capture the opponents honors. But since Kia knows I have to play the @CQ, he knows his @ca would capture my @cQ. Therefore, ducking is not necessarily a bad idea.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a reasonable alternative. However, what are you planning to bid if partner bids 3@C or 3@D or 3@H? Before making a bid in a competitive auction you should think about the most likely things partner will bid and what your next bid will be.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The answer is that given East chooses to double, she should bid 3N over any 3 level bid by pard. That shows 19-21. Because it is a "double and correct" to NT which shows a stronger hand than bidding NT right away.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Her other alternative would bid to bid 2N showing 15-18 and a spade stopper. But she is slightly too strong to do that especially with the 5 card suit. So I like double and correct to 3N best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I say "you never lose the post mortem if you lead partner's suit." @D10 would work out well as it turns out were you on lead, but if I had a singleton instead of a double Qx, it would not.|

pc|S6|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East counts tricks, there are 5 hearts, 2 spades 2 clubs and a diamond for 10 tricks. So this is an easy hand to play provided she knocks out the @SA before playing out her minor suit winners.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So remember that double and correct to NT shows a stronger hand (usually 19-21) than a direct NT overcall. The only time it doesn't show 19-21 is if it goes, for example, 1@D-P-P-Dbl-P-1@H-P-1NT. In that case, 1@D-P-P-1NT shows 11-14, so the "double and correct" would show the 15-18 point hand when the doubler is in balancing position.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Somewhat unlucky. reasonable line. Although I would have ducked the spade, because it sets up 2 tricks, and I can only cash 1 diamond. That gives some extra chances. Kia might have had the @SK. or the @HJ might be coming down or the club finesse might work.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|None of those happen to work on this hand, but ducking the spade gives you more options without risking the contract. The way East played the hand, the club finesse has to work plus clubs have to be 3-3 or the heart jack has to come down. So always try to maximize your chances.|

She even provided us with "Depend on Inference" article by Alfred Sheinwold published in St. Petersburg Times on June 4, 1969. You read it correctly. 1969 was when Richard Nixon was our President and Spiro Agnew was the Vice-President.

Depend on Inference was published in his column Sheinwold on Bridge in St. Petersburg Times of June 1969  |CP|1|AT|^*Hnews.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19690604&id=XspaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0XsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4482,2922081&hl=en^*N|CP||AT|


Using |CP|1|AT|^*Hnews.google.com/newspapers^*N|CP||AT| link from the main source, MM had a dreamy journey through many other published news papers of the Yesteryears. Give it a try if you wish.

We present the article by Mr. Cohen first followed by Mr. Sheinwold's column. Of course, we asked Mr. Schutzman to help us understand what the demi-gods are talking about. His comments follow Mr. Cohen's board.

^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|I played this deal in an online money game. At IMP scoring. With both sides vulnerable my partner dealt and opened 1@S. |mb|1s|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If playing Standard (which I would call old-fashioned) this hand might be worth 2@D. That bid (the old-fashioned way) showed 10+  -  and this hand is probably worth it due to the good 5-card suit and beautifully fitting @SQ. Anyway, 2@D would be GF (the modern way), so I had to respond 1NT semi-forcing, (my preferred way, which happened to be the default bidding system in this particular game).|mb|p1n|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
My partner bid 2@H. Now what? Partner's 2@h has a wide range–it could be up to 17 or even 18 (just short of a jumpshift), so passing is too pessimistic.|mb|p2h|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 I took what is referred to as a "false-preference" back to 2@S.|mb|p2s|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner is the expected 5-4 and has a minimum, 2@S in the 5-2 would be just fine. But, partner bid again. He next called 2NT.|mb|p2n|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What is this? He has to have extra values (he would have passed 2 with a minimum). I had extras myself (I just love that @SQ). Partner is likely 5=4=2=2 and I pictured something like:  @SAKJ72   @HA652   @D103   @CA2. That would be 9 easy tricks. I was a little worried about the club suit, but decided to raise to 3NT. |mb|p3N|

I had 6 top tricks and could work on spades or diamonds. Which one? If spades are 3-3 (or 109 doubleton), there are 4 spade tricks + 1 heart + 3 diamonds + 2 clubs = 10 tricks. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even if spades don't come in, I could fall back on 3-3 diamonds for 5 potential tricks. It is better to play spades first, because if they don't break, you have the option of setting up the long spade in dummy with an entry to it.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Working on diamonds first puts all eggs in that basket. More on this a little later. So, you win the club lead and play |pc|cac3c7|

PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have 8 tricks (2 spades, 1 heart, 3 diamonds and 2 clubs). If you play diamonds now and they split, you are fine. But, if they don't, you are out of options. It will be too late to go back to spades. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, if you set up the long spade (without testing diamonds), you might go down immediately. You are giving them 2 spade tricks and if clubs were 5-3, they have 3 clubs to cash. Imagine setting up the spades, watching them cash 3 club tricks and then finding out diamonds were 3-3 the whole time?|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhat suit did he finally choose?^Spades~Diamonds^1|NT|^B@2
The answer is in trick 1. I purposely glossed over it at the time. Astute readers were likely wondering why I didn't tell them which club was led. In fact, it was the @C2. A good declarer has to notice such things. |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Assuming your opponents are playing standard leads, the @C2 tells you that West has only 4 cards in clubs. Yes, he could be deceiving you, but in general, defenders lead honestly. They don't want to fool their partner.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Knowing clubs are 4-4 gives you the answer. You should establish dummy's long spade. The defense can get only the 2 spade tricks and will have only 2 club winners to take.|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|This was the Real Deal. West led the 2 (make sure you take notice). You win and play a spade to the queen and a spade to the king and ace. East returns a club.

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|East-West reach 3NT and North leads the @HJ and dummy plays low. How should you defend as South?|
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Well, a brief piece of arithmetic shows that North has 0-1 point. So, given that he has already shown the @HJ, partner has not a stitch outside his Heart suit.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So, the only way to take five tricks on this hand will be to take two Clubs and three Hearts. The problem is that taking the @HK and playing one back will be futile – there is no way of reaching the North hand. |
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^b@2
However, a cunning plan might well work… So the right defense is to duck the @HJ. Declarer could, you may think, recover by ducking this (actually, he can't – a Spade switch is deadly), so he takes the @HQ and sets about the Club suit.|
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^b@2
You take the @CQ and play – careful now – the @HK to knock out the @HA on table. Now, suddenly, the path is clear to reach partner's hand in Hearts. A further Club is taken by your @CA and you can play your last Heart to partner's three winners.|
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Declarer could have made the hand by taking the @HA at trick one – you have no defense to counter that. Should he have done so? Well, if you are one of these pairs whose opening leads include "strong Tens" (so you would lead the @H10 from @HK J 10 and the like) then Yes, he should. If the @HJ could be from @HJ 10 9 as well as @HK J 10 9 then No, he probably should run the lead to the @HQ.|

West was unlucky to run up against you two in defense. Still, if you defend accurately all the time you will meet a lot of very unlucky declarers…|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|The three low Clubs are bad news, giving you three immediate losers. Four trumps would have been nicer than three, but three is what North got dealt - it isn't his fault that you were optimistic in the bidding is it? He could hardly Pass, could he? So here you are, in a delicate 4@S. You can do nothing while the opponents cash their Club winners. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You must retain the @S9 for trumping the next Heart. On this trick, you have two chances to make a trick with the @S7 - one is that East still has a Heart left, the other is that West has the @S8. |
PG| ***** 263 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Ruffing with the @S2 increases the risk that East can over-ruff on this round. Ruffing with the @S9 increases the risk that either East or West can ruff with the @S8 on the next round.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You need to come to hand now to ruff the last Heart. You could ruff a Diamond (it can't get over-ruffed, after all) but just as good is to use the trump suit as an entry to the closed hand.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding.
As dealer we open 1@S. West makes a thin overcall of 2@C and partner competes with 2@S. We make an optimistic decision to go for game, so arrive in 4@S.|
PG| ***** 270 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play.
West cashes the three top Clubs against 4@S, on the third of which East discards a Heart. This leaves him with only two cards in that suit, which is significant during the subsequent play.|
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


NT|^b@2
West attempts to defeat the contract by cashing his @DA at trick four.  However, we ruff that and take stock. The Count reveals eight tricks (six Spades and two Hearts) so we Plan to ruff two losing Hearts in dummy (in the short trump hand, note) to make the total rise to ten.|
PG| ***** 272 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The sequence of play is to cash the @HA followed by the @HK and then attempt to ruff the two low Hearts in dummy. The subtle difference this time is that we lack the protection afforded by the @S9 8 (as was available in Hand 2). So, we must decide which trump to ruff the first low Heart with. The choice is from the @S9, the @S7 or the @S2. |
PG| ***** 273 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Ruffing with the @S2 is silly, but ruffing with the @S9 is unnecessary and wasteful on this trick, because we need to ruff the fourth round of Hearts too. The correct card is the @S7, because this will win the trick whenever East has to follow suit (we don't know he is out of Hearts, remember) or whenever West has the @S8.|
PG| ***** 274 ***** |


NT|^b@2
When that proves successful, we return to hand with a trump and ruff the final Heart with the @S9. After that, we are home and dry in 4@S. |
