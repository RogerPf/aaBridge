^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has a bidding dilemma with that strong hand. Should he open 2@C or 1@D?|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If North's long suit were hearts, no question he should open 2@C. However, with long diamonds, it is a problem to open 2@C. Because when the auction starts 2@C-2@D-^*B3@D^*n, the first non-artificial bid is at the 3 level.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The hand is too strong for a 2N opener or rebid after 2@C even if you overlook the 6-4 shape. I would probably open the hand 1@D and rebid 2@S treating it as a max opener.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out 6@D by North is a very good contract. But if North starts with 2@C, East should still bid 3@H. I would pass (which shows at least an ace or king).|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Double by me shows a weak hand with no aces or kings. That is something you should play. although you don't get a lot of competition over 2@C, but sometimes you do.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you should play double shows no values and pass shows some values. You could reverse the meaning of double and pass, but experts play double is the weakest bid you can make as responder when 2@C is interfered with.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would bid 4@H with the West hand. It turns out EW only take 7 tricks so 4@H doubled down 3 is slightly worse than 5@D (or 3NT) making. But they are unlikely to be doubled and it is still better than 6@D making which is theoretically the best contract. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, the most important point is to be reluctant to open 2@C when your rebid has to be 3@D. I am not saying never open 2@C when your suit is diamonds, but be reluctant to do so when you have a questionable 2@C opener.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Its not because responder ends up playing the hand (although that is another disadvantage) but that you are basically preempting yourself by starting the natural bidding at 3@D|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
An impartial observer: But during the live session, North did not play the hand as it is shown here. What is up?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At this vulnerability especially with a singleton diamond, I would have passed 2@S doubled holding 5 spades.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
In general, when deciding whether or not to double a preempt, the following factors favor doubling rather than bidding:|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^Ca) length in trump (which West has);
^Cb) shortness in partner's suit (which West also has);
^Cc) vulnerability (which is the best it could be for doubling 2@S).
I will see how 2@S doubled does later.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 ways to respond to 5N king ask. One is to show number of kings (6C = 0, 6D = 1, 6H  = 2). And that's fine.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, experts prefer showing "specific" kings. So when I bid 5N, if North had a king and we were playing specific kings, he would bid the suit in which he had the king. On this hand he would bid 6@H since he has no kings.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also on this hand, it doesn't matter whether we play number of kings or specific kings because I have the other 3 kings, if North has 1 king I know it is the diamond king. But let's play specific kings just for fun.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, since East had the @DK, it did not matter how I played the hand. But I gave myself an extra chance in case West had the @DK. I did that by eliminating the black suits from both hands before playing diamonds. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That way, if West happens to hold the @DK, there still is a chance I can make the hand. If West started with a doubleton @DK, he will have to lead a black suit. I can ruff in dummy and throw away my low diamond loser. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even on the hand as it was, note that East had the doubleton diamond king and ended up having to lead a black suit giving me the same ruff and discard (although I discarded my @DQ which was a winner anyway).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D was perfectly good bid. It will make if the @DQ is singleton or doubleton, which is 50%. It turns out if West doubles they can make 3@S. But if West doubles, East, with an opener will likely end up pushing the hand to 4@S which is down 1. And I could have had a better hand in which case the double could have worked out badly.|

West might only have 10, so you would be 1 short. But it still might make and West could have 11 or 12. So in IMPs I think 4@S is clear. |

In Matchpoints, I tend to be more conservative with an 8-card fit. The question is if 4@S is at least 50% I would probably still bid 4@S but I don't think passing 3@S is terrible in Matchpoints.|mb|4s|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. Let me discuss a convention I play over a 1NT overcall. It is not played by very many people, but I really like it. |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I play any time the opponents bid 1NT, either opening or responding 1NT to an opening bid, or overcalling 1NT. I play DONT.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the East hand I might decide to bid 2@H over the 1NT overcall. That shows hearts and spades just like it would if there was a 1NT opener and EW do have a heart fit. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not sure how well they do in 2@H. So being vul against non vul I probably pass with the East hand. But if not vul I bid 2@H.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Before touching a card, you should try and plan your play. It would be a bit too difficult to try and picture your opponents' hand distribution since there are no clues to work with here!|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Whilst you are planning your play, what can you also make out of this opening lead?|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT||lb|*yIs the opening lead from shortage^^y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead is obviously from shortage. Could be from a singleton, or possibly a doubleton. Regardless of which, you are always going to cover it with the king anyway since you have all of the remaining high diamonds except the ace.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It looks like you'll be losing a diamond, a potential diamond ruff, and one or two spades.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why isn't there a (potential) heart loser?|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Because you have two winning cards in dummy to make two discards in your hand. Dummy's fourth diamond, along with the @CK. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us now work through both cases in which West's diamond holding might be. 

If it is a singleton, the defense will go diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club return. You win it in dummy and ... ?|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||lb|*yAnd you will play on trumps of course. Right?^^n|cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|It doesn't matter what you do if West had a singleton diamond and gets his ruff, but if it was from a doubleton diamond, the diamond unblock gives you flexibility should you decide to change your plan.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
What I mean by that is, you unblock the @D9 now and next play the @D10 on the expected diamond return. If West doesn't ruff this trick, we can then decide which hand to win this trick in and go from there.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Of course, you probably have worked out what to play next assuming you will be winning the second trick, but allowing yourself this type of flexibility will give you that extra edge not only on this board, but in future hands where it might matter even more.|PC|d9|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|What you don't want to do is to play the @SQ from dummy (or a low spade from hand to dummy's queen).|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If East is able to win it with the ace, gives West a diamond ruff, you will be on the horns of a dilemma as you will need to guess the location of the @SJ.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Therefore, you want to win this trick in dummy and play a low spade from dummy. Even if East hops up with the ace and gives West a diamond ruff, your @SK and @SQ should draw the outstanding trumps.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Play: 
On the sight of dummy and the opening lead, you can deduce that West either has a singleton or a doubleton queen. |
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It looks like you'll be losing a diamond, a potential diamond ruff, and one or two spades. Given that you have two winning cards in dummy (the @CK and the fourth diamond), you will be able to use both of these cards to discard hearts from hand, pitching any possible heart losers. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us now work through both cases in which West's diamond holding might be. If it is from a singleton, the defense will go like this: Diamond to the ace, diamond ruff, club return. You win it in dummy and ... ? |
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And you will not touch the trumps. At all. Nada. With another potential diamond ruff looming, you must first get rid of your liability (diamond) by discarding it from dummy's club winners. After this, you will then turn your attention to the trump suit.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How would you then play the trump suit?|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


AT|
Certainly not by leading dummy's queen. The reason for this is because if East has the @SA and captures the queen with the ace and plays back another diamond, we will have but no choice to insert the @S10 and hope that our RH opponent has the now-bare @SJ. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The better play therefore is to lead a low spade from dummy, intending to play the king if East plays low. This way, if East hops up with the ace, we do not need to waste any honor cards on this trick. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If our king is beheaded by West's ace, then we would next play a spade to dummy's queen.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now what if West has led from a doubleton diamond? East will presumably win the ace and return a diamond. Which hand will you win that trick in? Before we get to that, let's review on what diamond cards you should play (from hand) on the first two tricks. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given that all of the diamonds between our hand and dummy are all equals (after the opening lead of the @DQ), you should get into a good habit of "unblocking" the @D9 (or 10) on the very first trick. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It doesn't matter what you do if West had a singleton diamond and gets his ruff, but if it was from a doubleton diamond, the diamond unblock gives you flexibility should you decide to change your plan. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What I mean by that is, you unblock the @D9 on the first trick as East wins the ace, and next play the @D10 on the expected diamond return. If West doesn't ruff this trick, we can then decide which hand to win this trick in and go from there. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course, you probably would have worked out what to play next upon winning the second trick, but allowing yourself this type of flexibility will give you that extra edge not only on this board, but in future deals where it might matter even more. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now back to the question. In which hand are you going to win the second trick in? |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In order to answer this, you must think about what suit you want to play on. It seems like you want to draw some trumps before the opponents get a couple of diamond ruffs going, so that's what you will do.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play the queen of spades from dummy (or a low spade from hand to dummy's queen), East may be able to win it with the ace, give West a diamond ruff, and you would then be left in a pickle as you would need to guess the location of the @SJ. |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, you want to win the second diamond trick in dummy and play a low spade from dummy. Even if East hops up with the ace and gives West a diamond ruff, your @SK and @SQ should draw the outstanding trumps. Should West win the @SA then you are fine with the opponents taking two spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Playing off dummy's @CA and @CK is fine as well, but is unnecessary. If on dummy's low spade East rises with the ace, you don't really mind the diamond ruff, in fact, you welcome it! |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Can you now see how your play matters depending if West is getting his diamond ruff or not? |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Can you also see the importance of "playing the hand out" in your head based on West's two possible diamond holdings? |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2
These "train of thought", although may be difficult at first, will go a long way. By preparing yourself to the possibilities, you will be ready to counter anything or everything that comes at you! |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this deal, East will rise with the @SA if you lead a low spade off dummy, and a diamond ruff will proceed. With that ruff, you will then be able to draw the outstanding trumps and claim your contract (via dummy's fourth diamond and dummy's second club providing parking spaces for two of your hearts).|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Let's start our Count and Plan with a look at losers. What do we see?|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
LOSER: SPADES ZERO. The loser in our hand is covered in dummy. HEARTS: TWO. DIAMONDS: Three in hand, but the @DQ should grow up, so TWO. CLUBS: ONE if we guess wrong on the @CQ.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^B@2

PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|If we can get our @DQ to grow up, we can drop a Heart loser on it. The opening lead of the @DA locates the Diamonds for us.|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 That leaves us with having to guess the @CQ. Let's wait a few tricks and see if we get any more clues. Meantime... observe every card They play.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Oh my goodness! East started with a singleton Diamond. This hugely dramatic @HQ discard promises the @HJ and probably the @H10. It also denies the @HK. |
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Folks, it looks like our Success Count is going to be East's hand. If we can figure out how many Clubs he has, maybe we can locate the @CQ. |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's think this through a little. Neither East nor West bid Spades, so neither of them has five Spades. So how are the Spades splitting? How many does East have? How many Hearts?|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It looks like East has: four Spades, four Hearts (can't have five--his pard supported them and we have six of them) and one Diamond. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Ergo!! He has four Clubs, meaning West only has one. Our Success Count of East has told us how to play the Clubs. We can either drop the @CQ if West has it, or finesse it if East does. We are going to make this contract!|

NT|^B@2 
Suppose you made the mistake of playing the @HA on the first round, the @H10 again is falling from West. You would have to guess whether to finesse the @H9 on the second round.|

A finesse would be right if West had started with a singleton @H10. It would be wrong if West had started with @HJ 10 (or had played the @H10 from @HJ 10 x, hoping to fool you).|
