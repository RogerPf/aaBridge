^-|ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hi everyone. This week we are trying a slightly unusual format. East/West are a regular partnership who play weak NT. Normally, I do like to teach strong NT because that is what the vast majority play. But I thought it would be interesting for us to see the weak NT in action for this week.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

lcmdir: Shall we use DONT or natural over their Weak NT? |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a slight preference for natural (actually I use transfer overcalls which I will explain in a minute) but DONT works pretty well too. There is no perfect way to compete against a weak NT, which is one reason I play it. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

In "Transfer Overcalls", an overcall over 1NT is a transfer (e.g 1N-2D is a heart transfer.). The reason that works slightly better is because a) the 2@D bidder can continue bidding when appropriate since partner can't pass and b) the responder to the 2@D bidder can make other bids besides just accepting the transfer when they have a good hand. So I think it is a little more flexible than just natural overcalls. However, for this session we will use natural. So let us get started.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well that worked out well, but I have a number of comments. First of all, Anna should not be afraid to bid 3N once I show a good hand by bidding clubs. Her 3N was a nice bid. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, with Kxx of spades she can afford to hold up enough to run East out of spades and essentially keep West out of the picture.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Bergen calls this "Two against one declaring." So she should duck the first spade. If she does that, then she will just about always make the hand unless West has 4 hearts to the J, which is very unlikely.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's say she ducks, and they play 2 more rounds of spades.|

PC|htc2c5hj|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Then she wins 4@H and 1 spade and 1 club and 3 diamonds at least for 9 tricks which in IMPs is all she cares about.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
She ended up making 12 (although she should not), but if she plays it the way I suggest, then she always makes the hand.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On another issue, It is hard for EW to discard, but East should keep at least 4 diamonds since Anna opened 1@D and is likely to have at least 4. It is not as obvious for West to keep 10xx of clubs, but if he does, it turns out Anna only makes 9 tricks exactly.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next to the question about how to figure out how many times to duck - Rule 7 |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof7^*N|CP||AT|. That rule works sometimes, but I think you should just use common sense. Please click the link and study the presentation on Rule 7.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Based on the auction, West has 6 spades, Anna has 5 spades between the 2 hands, so East has 2 spades - 7-5=2. Moreover, the @SJ lead means that West has the @SA. So if Anna ducks the first spade, she can guarantee that if East ever gets in, he will be out of spades.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I know everyone likes rules, but to be a good player you have to learn how to count and deduce. You should be able to figure out, based on how many cards you have, how many times you need to duck in order to minimize the number of tricks for the defense and not need any "rule" to figure it out. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not against "rules" per se, but I am against using a rule if you don't understand why it works.|

john2611: So the lead of jack promises the ace by partner?|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, the lead of the J promises a doubleton. East should lead count in partner's suit. The @S10 denied the @SJ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an interesting bid. I like it, particularly since it is low risk at this vul. BTW, although I think West's pass is fine and correct with his flat 5 count and all quacks, I confess at this vul I might stretch and bid 2@H, but pass is the technically correct bid.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


mb|pp|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, here I would bid 4@H. West has the best hand he can have given he passed. Remember, as the auction proceeds you need to keep reevaluating your hand in the context of the auction. However Qxx of hearts is wonderful once pard bids 3@H. So I would bid 4H right or wrong. But pass could still be right and we will see how it works out.|

But in theory she should play her 2nd highest diamond with 4 so I am assuming she has 3 diamonds. If she has 3 diamonds, East started with 3 diamonds and I can still duck.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 9 is an invite, especially with a 5 card suit. Granted if we lead a spade and they are 5-3 you go down. But otherwise it makes on any other lead or if spades are 4-4. So I would want to be in 3N. On the other hand, I would have been in 4@H on board 1, so aggressive is not always right, just more fun :).|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another reason that I just thought of for West to invite is that pard opened 1@C so the @CKQ of clubs fit well with pard. All considered, I suggest you always invite with 9 and even 8 if you have a nice 5 card suit with 2 or more honors.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 2 choices are Jacoby 2NT and a splinter. You should splinter only when your hand is not too strong. The rule is you should not splinter with more than 16 dummy points.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No such thing. Once you decide to open 1@S, you can't misbid because you decided you were sorry you opened 1@S. Yes 4@S by you says minimal, but it also says you have no singletons or voids. And you have a singleton.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I could go slow and bid 3@D here, showing 1st or 2nd round control in diamonds (2nd round control in this case). But Anna having a singleton club means we have a great fit. 3 or 4 low clubs or 3 or 4 to the ace go well with a singleton. Further, I have all the other suits controlled.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West had a great lead and that was the only lead that beats 4. The bid I would have chosen with Anna's hand instead of 4@D is 3@S asking me to bid 3N with a spade stopper. But since Qxx is dubious as a spade stopper we still end up in 4@D  since I don't know Anna has the @SK.|

PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now is the time that you wished that you play penalty Doubles but don't worry, partner is no doubt short in spades and if partner has a fair hand, we will wait for the balancing take-out double. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As on this deal, partner has a great hand and will balance with a Double and to your surprise, this becomes the final contract! |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: North (your partner) played the @D6 on the first trick. You have the @D5 in your hand whilst you see the @D2 and @D3 in dummy, and declarer followed with the @D4. This means your partner played his lowest diamond, thus discouraging a diamond continuation. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You then switch to the @HK, winning, and continue with the @HJ as your partner overtakes it with the @HQ and fires back the @DJ. You take two more diamond tricks and switch to the @C6. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer finesses with the @CQ which loses to partner's king and partner plays back the @D10 as declarer ruffs with the @S8 and overruffed with your @S9. You then exit with the @C2 as declarer wins with dummy's @CA.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Down to trumps only (you and declarer), declarer plays a heart from dummy and ruffs it with the @S6 as you overruff with the @SQ. 

At this point you have @SA 5 3 2 and declarer has @SK J 10 4.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Don't lay down the @SA as this will give declarer the rest of the tricks. Instead, lead a low spade. Partner's @S7 will force out declarer's @S10. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Down to @SK J 4, declarer plays the @SK. With @SA 5 3 it now looks tempting to win it but you shouldn't. If you do win the trick, you will be down to @S5 3 and you will also be forced to play back into declarer's @SJ 4.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So instead, duck the @SK! Now declarer with @SJ 4 will be forced to play into your A 5 giving you two tricks instead of one! 

Don't believe me? Try it double dummy and see for yourself. |

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|There are three ways to attack this contract after winning the @SA at trick one. (See 'Bottom Line' on why you should not duck the opening lead). |
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1. The technical line: Cross to a high heart (in case there's a singleton @HQ about), unblock the @CA K Q, and take the heart finesse. |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2. The thief's line: Lead the @DJ at trick two hoping West has the @DA and ducks the trick. If he does, you have stolen trick ##9. |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3. The insulting line: Cash the @CA K Q, cross to dummy with a heart and play two more clubs hoping the player with five spades discards one of them. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If that happens, you can knock out the @DA safely as the opponents will only have a maximum of three spades to cash. So which line would you like to opt for? |
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Line 3 is the weakest. The player with five spades would have to make a gross error to discard a spade on the clubs. |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Line 2 has a chance. If West has something like @SJ x x x x and the @DA, he may not have realized that he has struck gold with the opening lead and may duck the @DJ hoping his partner can win with the hoped for @DQ to lead a spade through. |
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The good news is that West does indeed have the spade holding you were rooting for, the bad news is that East has the @DA. Thus, line 1 is the winner. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
THE BOTTOM LINE:
With a No-trump stopper such as A x facing x x, unless the suit might be divided 7-2, do not hold up, particularly when a low card is led. 

It is not always easy for the opening leader to read your weakness if you win the ace. |
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, if East plays the @SK and West has @SQ 10 x x (x), West cannot be sure who has the jack. In the actual diagram, West can't be sure who has the king. |
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, when trying to steal a trick (diamonds) with the king in the dummy and the Q J 10 (x) in the closed hand, the most deceptive card to lead is your second highest honor, the jack (which may look like you are finessing for the queen). |
