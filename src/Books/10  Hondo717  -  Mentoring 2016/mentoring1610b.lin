^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West had a clear DONT bid, and East had a clear pass. And had I let North defend as she was going to, the hand would have made. One of the reasons to be aggressive is that defense is hard and you often make contracts that you should not make against perfect defense.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: 
Playing a diamond to the @DQ was reasonable. But after the heart and club ruff then probably the best line is to lead a diamond to the @DJ and then lead a heart to the @H10.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am marked with the @HK and @HJ.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


AT| Why?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because when I led a heart and West played low, north played the @HA. If North had a lower honor, North would have played that.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this fashion, West won't lose control of the hand and will end up losing 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 1 club and 1 spade. Still down 1, but better than down 2. And since we probably make 1NT, a good score. Even down 2 is not bad.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, South should not bid 2N. With 4 diamonds, South should just defend.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss whether or not West should open. Those who believe in 3rd seat light openers would definitely open 1@S. However, I am a rule of 20 guy in all 4 seats. And not using Bergen "adjusted HCP".   West does not have rule of 20,   10 HCP and 9 majors = 19.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, if you add 1 for the quality suit, you have 11  "adjusted HCP" which means you have an optional opener. I might not open in 1st or 2nd seat, but I would open it in 3rd seat. However pass is ok as well.|

NT|^B@2
North had 3 and dummy had 4. If East started with 4, then yes, I have a trump. But if East started with 5, more likely, then I don't have any left. Plus even if I do, why let declarer win a trick with the @DQ.|pc|DK|SK||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Defense is hard. And one skill that most people need to work on is counting out the hand. There are often lots of clues in the bidding as to what declarer has such as on this hand. You must take advantage of those clues. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is much easier to declare, because you see all 26 of your cards. It is much harder as defender to work out what cards partner has but you have to try.|

I am not sure as to whether the hand can made. The line East took was reasonable.|

lc|c107|NT|^B@2
But some people who lead attitude and normally lead high from 3 make an exception from 10xx and lead 2nd highest. A few people play "middle up down", MUD, from 3 small, which I think is a horrible way to lead.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So lead either low from 3 small if you prefer count, or high from 3 small if you prefer attitude.|

NT|^B@2
docgreen:  If contract was 4@H I think I lead club.  But I considered the spade play as more aggressive. So aimed at getting a rough plus keep diamond suit for later.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you want to look for a ruff, then lead the @SJ. If you lead a low spade, partner will never figure out you have a doubleton. Further, the @SJ is very aggressive and often gives up a trick.|

Lead of a doubleton is often not a good lead and I tend to avoid it unless everything else seems worse.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, the reason some people play attitude is because they feel it is more important to know if partner has an honor or not than how many cards they have in the suit. In fact, my guess is more people play high from 3 small than low, although I don't know that for sure. I prefer low although I have some very good partners who prefer high.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem was West preempted 3@H rather than 4@H and then when partner bid 4@H that tempted her to bid 5. But if she had bid 4@H to start with, the problem would have disappeared.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next let us talk about North's 3@S bid. It tends to show about 8 or 9 points or a bad 10. With 10+ particularly with 4-card support, you just bid 4@S after a 3-level preempt.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It might not be right, but the preempt crowds the auction. So the values needed raise to the 3-level are lowered by a couple of points as are the number of points needed to bid game.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Unlike 1@S-P-4@S which is preemptive showing 5 spades, 1@S-3@H-4@S is NOT preemptive. It just shows a game forcing hand with spade support. You never preempt after a preempt. 1@S-4@H just shows 8 hearts. It is a little speculative when you are vul and they are not.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, if West had bid 4@H, then I am not sure what North should do. I might bid 4@S because of the singleton heart and 3 spades, but north is a little weak for that. That is why you preempt. You make the opponents guess what to do, and they sometimes guess wrong.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I need to decide what to do. It is not clear at all. We should only have an 8-card fit because pard should bid 3@H with 4-card support. On the other hand, I have a singleton. Regardless, I will pass and see what happens.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If they bid 3@C I will then bid 3@H because of my singleton club. If they bid anything else I will pass. In IMPs pass might be best. Pard could have 4 clubs. In Match Points I would bid 3@H.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Since the auction is forcing to game, you could bid just 2@S. However, it is a better description of your hand to jump to 3@S, showing a good 6-card suit and extra playing strength.|MB|3S|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|You see that you have two potential losers in the diamond suit. What chance or chances can you see of restricting these to just one?|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||lb|*yCould West have started with DK85 or DQ85^^y|NT|^B@2
In the diamond suit itself you have the chance that West will hold one or both of the @DKQ. West would hardly under lead when he held both of these cards, but he might have started with @DK85 or @DQ85. In that case you can finesse on the first round, losing to East's honor, and subsequently take a winning finesse against West's honor. Can you see another chance?|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If clubs break 4-3, you may be able to set up a second diamond discard on the suit. To take advantage of this possibility, you will have to plan your entries to dummy carefully.|

nt||lb|*bYour bid^^1n|mb|1np4n|lb|*mPartner's bid is^Asking for Aces~Is Quantitative^2|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|North has a very good hand and has been bitten by the slam bug. He is aware that a combined point count of 33 is usually enough for a slam and knows that the North-South hands must be somewhere near that. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To be unsure of that combined total, North must have something like 16-17 points and a balanced hand. Your job is to decide whether to advance to a slam or to stay in game.|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


nt||lb|*bYour bid please.^^p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This is not a close decision. You have a bare 15 points (bad news) and a horrible 4-3-3-3. shape (bad news). 6NT is not on the menu. You should Pass as rapidly as you can. Note that 5@S ("I have three Aces, partner!") is a fatuous response. What do you think partner would do over that?|mb|ppp|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


PC|dq|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|There are some points to be made here. Firstly, 4NT is no laydown contract (let alone 6NT, which is utterly hopeless). Secondly, You can often find life a struggle when 4-3-3-3 hands face 4-3-3-3 hands - you can have duplication of values. On this hand, the @SA K Q J and the @HA K Q J are only worth three tricks each. This suggests that you should often downvalue 4-3-3-3 hands in the bidding. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This is a decent contract. If the fates are cruel we might lose two diamonds (where's the @DA?) and it's possible to lose two spade tricks.
 
There's nothing we can do about diamonds, the Ace is either onside or it isn't, but we have a two-way finesse in spades. What is the best play?|
