^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played by North. What North did was an expert declarer play. He could see 4 potential losers
hondo717:  1 spade 2 diamonds and 1 heart. One way to get rid of a diamond loser was to set up an end play, which is what he did.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way to set up an end play is to strip the hand of the irrelevant suits (spades and clubs on this deal)  and throw the opponents in and make them lead your problem suit (diamonds in this case).|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But North had to hope that West had the @HQ and the @DA. So he had to first play a diamond to the Q to set up the end play, which he did. Anyway, really well played. many experienced players would have gone down.|

up|33|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have several comments on both the bidding and play. West has a perfectly good rule of 20 one diamond opener. 10 HCP and 11 cards in spades and diamonds = 21. Although North is worried about missing a heart fit, 2@C is the best bid. There really is no other alternative and I love to overcall 2@C over 1@D and strain to do so. The reason being is it makes it harder for the opponents to find a major suit fit.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It looks likely to North that they have a spade fit. So I agree with 2C 100%. Now, what should East do?|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT| Personally I think a negative double is the best bid. With 2 4-card majors and not to mention that 2@H shows 10 points (West is close but a bit shy) and, more importantly, a 5-card suit. Those are the problems with the 2@H bid.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless I bid 3@C. If I were West, I would bid 3@D. With 7-4 distribution you don't want the opponents playing the hand if you can help it. 3@D does pretty well. However, if East makes the negative double as I suggested then West might very well bid 3@S which, with the 4-1 break, is  a bit iffy.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, if played carefully, they can make it. Losing only 1 heart and 2 or 3 spades. All in all North/South got a very nice result for playing in 3@C.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you are highly distributional you do want to strain to get the contract.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
sshmj:  Once you told us to stop early in case of misfit. that's 2nd reason not to bid 3@D for me.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand, but with 7 diamonds you, by definition, have a diamond fit. voids are very rare so you are allowed to assume an 8+ card fit.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. It was certainly an opening lead that many players would make, but I have found that lead K from KQ without the J (or at least the 10) often works out badly. And since West bid diamonds, I would have led a diamond personally. But the heart, as I said, was a reasonable alternative.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unless West has a void in spades, there are very few hands where he should bid 5@H. He has what he said he had, an opening bid with 5 hearts. He does have the singleton spade but other than that a weak hand. The double by North was a good bid.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick 4 North should have played his last club. North need to understand, my signal was "informational" and not a demand to shift. I understand North was worried about setting up clubs for declarer. However, West can do that himself anyway.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@H actually worked out ok for EW since we make 5@S, but it is really not up to West to decide since he has what he said he had with 1@H. So West should pass. Having said that, I am  not sure that it is clear for East to bid 5@H.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"Double Dummy" defense will beat 5@H 3 if North leads a diamond, but that is hard to see. Also, I guess if North leads a 4th club, then it is also down 3. That is fairly easy to see. So it should be down 3.|

The question then is, should I double or should I bid 1@S. My rule in general, when I am 5-4 or 4-5 in the majors and have a choice of double or overcalling is to overcall my 5-card suit. That has worked out better for me more often than not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C over 1@S is forcing but not game forcing. It only promises 10 points or so. The question is, if West bids anything over 2N, is that forcing or not? I play the following, which I think is a good way to play.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner makes an invitational bid (2N on this hand) and you bid anything other than pass you are "accepting" his invitation. So the bid by West is forcing in which case East has to make some bid.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, I think West meant 3@D as to play, but, as I said, it is not clear that's what it means. So I would have passed with the East hand. I recommend you play my style over invitational 2N bids.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, if you play my style, any bid over 2NT is forcing. It is a frequency argument. There are more hands where you have a game forcing hand but are not sure where to play than hands where you want to stop in 3@D. So you give up on the occasional hand where 3@D is better than 2N in favor of the more frequent hands where you need to explore for the right game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the 1N bid over 1@D. It was the right bid given we play inverted minors. But it is one of my least favorite bids so much so that I do the following over 1@C. If I bid 1N over 1@C, then that shows 8-10. On occasion, with 6 or 7 points and 3-3-3-4 distribution I will bid 1@D with my 3 card suit just to avoid bidding 1N.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course that approach doesn't help over 1@D. So some pairs play the style, sometimes called "Criss Cross." They play that 1@D-P-2@D and 1@C-P-2@C are not inverted. They are simply 6-9 raises. They also still play that 1@D-P-3@D and 1@C-P-3@C are weak.|

AT| They bid 3@C over 1@D (e.g. 1@D-P-3@C) and 2@D over 1@C (e.g. 1@C-P-2@D). Not saying you should play that, but it does solve the problem of bidding 1N.|

It must be three or four cards to an honor or a singleton. (Under your methods partner wouldn't lead a low card from three or four low ones)|

Probably not. That would give declarer four diamonds and he is likely to have bid 2@D over 2@C. Where else can you look for additional tricks?|

Firstly, you should realize that partner has signaled for a club when he led the @H3.|

NT|^b@2
Secondly, I am sure everyone can see that the defense has nothing else to go for except a heart ruff. However, we should make it 100% clear to partner by returning the @C8 - it is best to avoid any confusion at all times, no matter how obvious the play might seem to you.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: The opponents had a natural and an invitational auction to 3@s. |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Opening Lead: @D2 - although a fourth best heart is definitely a reasonable alternative. |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play: After winning the diamond lead with the ace, you then had to think about the best way to defeat this 3@s contract. 

At first you might think that it's possible that partner has led from a singleton diamond (so we return a diamond to give partner a ruff) but a careful analysis from the bidding suggests that declarer is unlikely to hold four diamonds as declarer did not rebid 2@D over 2@C. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^b@2
With such intimidating clubs in dummy (and four small clubs in your hand), you should turn your attention to the heart suit if you hope to defeat this contract. Having the @sA (control) gives you a big advantage since it makes a heart ruff entirely possible - so you return the @H9. |
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If our partner has the @HA then he can duck our heart switch to keep communication, and if our partner has the @HK instead, we'd then have to hope that our partner will have a side-suit entry back to his hand to provide us with a heart ruff. On the @H9 switch declarer plays low as partner plays the king, winning, and the @H3 is returned. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This heart card, the @H3, is a suit-preference signal since our @H9 switch suggested that it was from shortness. Therefore, with this information in mind, when declarer plays off the @sJ from dummy we must not play a low spade from reflex (i.e. playing low and hoping declarer finesses into partner's potential @sQ) because our partner has told us that he has a club entry.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So it is prudent that we keep our @s3 intact and rise with the @sA, switch to the @C8 (also a suit-preference signal, suggesting that partner returns back a heart), and collect our heart ruff.|

Spades: Probably six winners and no losers. This assumes a 3-2 break. If trumps are 4-1 you have five winners and one loser. If trumps are 5-0, it doesn't bear thinking about;|

Clubs: One slow trick for sure, two losers (unless some idiot in defense leads the @CA or plays it on air).|
