^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is the time for a suit preference signal, assuming West carefully watched the spots. East is expecting West to ruff. Therefore, the spot she leads back in diamonds indicates which suit she wants back.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If she leads a low diamond back (as she did) she wants the lower of the remaining suits (clubs and hearts) meaning she wants West to lead back a club.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But why East wants a club, when you have a sure heart trick? Had she wanted a heart, she would lead back her high diamond, the @D8.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding.
If East wanted to pass in 1st seat, that would be ok. However, she does have 12 HCP + 8 cards in the red suits so meets the rule of 20. On the other hand, if she plays Bergen "adjusted" HCP she deducts one for @SQx and now is down to 11 HCP. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If the East/West partnership want to play that you don't open 8 loser hands in 1st and 2nd seat, that's ok. I stick with the rule of 20 myself, but the 8 loser rule is very reasonable.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The first 2 bids are fine. West has a problem and pass is acceptable if a bit conservative. 2@C is a bit strong although nice 7-card suits are rare. So I would not hate 2@C by West (and in fact that is what I would bid).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North should make the LOTT bid of 3@S, not 2@S. Better yet, she should bid 2@D, a limit raise. North has 11 Dummy points--9 HCP, one quality suit point, and one point for the doubleton.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given she bid 2@S, East is right to pass. But West has a clear 3@C bid. Even if East has a singleton club (voids are very rare), 3@C has got to be a reasonable contract. Passing 1@S on the first round is conservative but acceptable. But on the second round West has a very clear 3@C bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I completely agree with the bidding here. West's hand started out looking good but, as sometimes happens, it kept getting worse as the auction proceeded. My bidding 2@C was not helpful and East opening 1@H was not good for West hand either.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So although West should have had high hopes for the hand, they diminished as the auction proceeded. When you know you have a misfit, stop ASAP, which is what he did.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should they be in 4. They have a likely heart loser. So if they can hold their diamonds to 2 losers, they can make. But that is far from clear. I would not hate being in 4, but I don't think being in 3 is wrong either.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, East could bid 4@H over 2@S. She has 18 Bergen Starting points. And her heart suit is "self-sufficient" meaning it plays ok even opposite a singleton.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For the purposes of bidding, you are allowed to assume partner has at least a singleton in your suit, because voids are very rare. Therefore, East should bid 4@H once West shows 10 points with the 2@S bid.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East should really like her hand. Her club void is fantastic once I bid clubs and her @SK fits well with partner. All partner needs for 4 to make is a diamond honor and the @SA. And even without a diamond honor, it has plays.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There were 2 problem plays on this hand, one by each side. Given that West returned a diamond at trick six, the hand should make. North just needs to draw trump and just lose a club at the end. The way she played it, she lost an extra ruff.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, at trick 6, West should return the @c10 when in with the @SQ. If he does that, and East then wins the club and returns another club North has to ruff on the board. Then West has 2 trumps and  South only has 1 trump.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand a club is a better play than a diamond. If EW are getting a diamond trick, it is not going away. But if partner has the @CA, then west should be able to figure out that the hand is down 1.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Defending is hard and requires a lot of visualization. So I am not saying it is easy for West to figure that out, but it is doable.|

NT|^B@2
If the @CJ was in the diamond suit I still would open but the hand is not nearly as good. With with AKJ of clubs, the hand actually adds to 21 using Bergen adjusted HCP and the rule of 20. The problem with not opening is that you will never be able to get your strength across.|ub||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try. The 4-1 break did you in. What about my opening bid?|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even if you don't open weak 2s with an outside 4-card major, in 3rd seat you should and most do.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Preempting in 3rd seat is the most effective seat there is. The auction was fine although East is a little light for 3@H even though East technically has 10 HCP.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The @DQ is probably not worth much (as it turns out it did take a trick) and 4-3-3-3 is the worst distribution there is. Not to mention the hand has a lot of "quacks" (queens and jacks) and quacks are not worth as much as their HCP indicate unless the are paired with aces and kings. So although I would bid 3@H with the east hand I would not be happy.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to how to play the hearts playing the @HJ after cashing the @HA was not correct. East should either take the heart finesse, or just plan on taking 2 heart tricks.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Personally, I probably ruff the 2nd diamond and play a spade. Then that loses, I win the diamond return with my @DQ and play a club. That loses and I end up losing the same 5 tricks as it turns out (1 D, 1 C, 1 S, and 2 H)  but just a little differently :).|

A Kib: East shouldn't ruff @DK|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The Kib brings up a good point. If East does not ruff the @DK, and just pitches, I now have to play a club form the board and ruff in my hand. Then I am now out of trump and East takes the last 2 tricks with a trump and a club or heart (whichever she has remaining).|

A good rule is to not ruff with a natural trump trick. try and use it to draw declarer's trump.|

mb|p4h|NT|^B@2
That shows first or second round control in Hearts, but also promising a control in the Club suit that we have denied (else North would have just signed off in 4@S, knowing that the Club suit is wide open).|

Asking for number of kings (but also confirms that all of the aces are accounted for - if an ace is missing, you'd have just signed off in slam without needing to look for more information).|

PC|hahjh5|NT|^B@2
Rising with the @HA is a good start - East has already told you the whereabouts of the @HK from the auction (the double of the 4@H cue-bid). And, to boot, think of the @H9 discouraging lead along with the @HJ encouraging card that East has just played. That's three pieces of evidence to confirm it - the @HK is on your right!|
