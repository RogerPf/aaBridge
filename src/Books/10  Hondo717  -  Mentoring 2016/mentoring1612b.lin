^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was always making 2 because the @HA was onside. West needs to keep heart "parity" with dummy. That means West needs to keep the same number of hearts as dummy has, to avoid setting up a long heart. West needs to pitch spades instead. Other than that, this was a fairly mundane hand.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I expect in IMPs N/S would win 2 IMPs or so. In match points, I would guess we get an average plus.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to letting us play 1NT, I might choose to bid 2@S with the West hand over my 1NT, but I am not sure how well that does. With a diamond/heart cross ruff it might do OK. EW take 2 spades 1 heart and 1 diamond for sure.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The question is, can they win 4 more tricks with 2 ruffs in each hand. Probably 2@S is down 1. However I think I would bid 2@S. 2@S down 1 is a better score in Match Points  than letting me make 2NT or 3NT. Again, try to be aggressive in your bidding if for no other reason than it is easier to declare than defend.|

mb|p|mb|4D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting bid. That is a splinter. I would bid 3@H to keep the bidding lower, but 4@D is certainly very reasonable. You need to weigh economy vs. descriptiveness when considering your bids. Most players heavily weigh descriptiveness and don't think about economy. But economy can be important.|

NT|^B@2
nome: How can a pass hand bid Splinter please?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The answer is, you can splinter any time you have 4-card support, shortness, and enough points for a game force. On this hand, once West opens 2@C, East has enough points for a game force and therefore can splinter.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Another less obvious case would be the following auction. |CS|6|CP|4|AT|
^B{|ia|1DP1SP2HP!4C|at|}|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


HT|F|CP||AT|^M@2
On this auction opener reversed and responder could splinter with as little as 10 points since opener is showing 16. So 4@C only promises 10 points (and 5+ spades, 4 hearts, and a singleton club).|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||mb|p|MB|?|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4N here is fine, but let's play Kickback. Although I don't recommend it necessarily, lets have 4@S be RKCB. It allows you to do the queen ask more easily. The responses are 4N = 1 or 4, 5@C = 0 or 3, 5@D = 2 without queen, 5@H = 2 with queen.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|MB|?|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West can now bid 5@C asking about the @HQ. The queen ask is always one higher than the response.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


mb|5C|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand the response to the queen ask is 5@H--no queen. But if East had the @HQ he would bid the cheapest king he had (not counting the @HK of course). Therefore, if we add the @HQ to the East hand, East's response to 5@C would be 5@S (denying the @DK and showing the @HQ and @SK).|mb|5H|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, once you initiate RKCB you should bid 6 if you have all the key cards (as on this hand) or 4 key cards and the trump queen.|mb|6H|

UP|24|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West made a nice play in trump to guard against a 4-0 break. In Match Points, North should probably play a heart honor to ensure a heart trick. But in IMPs, playing low is OK. I shouldn't have the HK, but in case I do (East/West would then have misbid). It is our only chance to beat the contract once the spade lead fails.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Theoretically 6@S is down on a diamond lead, but if an East/West found that defense on that auction, frankly I would be suspicious.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think the "Garozzo rule" of "always lead a singleton" applies to a slam. 6@D is an easy contract. 6@S is a tougher play. Declarer has 3 clubs you have to get rid of. He has to take the heart finesse and throw 1 club on the @HA and ruff the other 2. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because West ducked the @SA and did not use it to capture declarer's trump, it made. Had he taken the @SA right away and led a spade, the hand goes down. Remember, aces are used to capture the opponents resources whenever possible.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen calls this his "favorite" auction. North is known to have nothing, East opened, South doubled, West redoubled. So South can't possibly think North has much. Therefore North can bid a lot with 0 points because North knows South will never play him for anything.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Marty Bergen (and I) would bid 3@C with the North hand and even if you don't play 3@C is preemptive there North should bid 2@C because North is not showing values, just showing a preference for a suit. Pass by North says South can pick a suit.|mb|3C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good point by jordy, Since West has the @CQ, North should play a suit preference signal when I lead the @CA. @C9 says North has something in the higher of the non trump suits (hearts). A low club would say North has something in the lower suit (diamonds on this hand).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure if they make 4@S even without the heart shift. It depends on how East plays the diamonds. If East plays me for Jxxx of diamonds, then they take 6 spades and 5 diamonds. But if East plays for a 3-3 diamond break, then they take only 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given the auction (e.g. North showing long clubs), the diamond finesse is probably better because North rates to be short in diamonds especially when North shows up with 3 spades. But North could have had Jx of diamonds. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, I suspect most competent declarers, assuming this auction, would have made the hand. On the other hand, they probably don't get the same auction at most tables. Very few Norths would bid 3@C.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is a good bidding principle to remember. When your partner makes a takeout double and the opponent redoubles you have a "license to steal" in terms of bidding. No matter what you bid, partner will not think you have many HCP. So you should pre-empt appropriately.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer opened 1@H (thereby showing at least five hearts). Secondly, declarer rebid 2@D (showing at least four diamonds). Thirdly, declarer then bid 3NT showing at least two clubs with a stopper.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
To work out whether declarer is 2-2 or 1-3 in the black suits, we shall go to the opening lead. Partner has led the @C3 which we can see must be from a four-card suit (we can see the @C2 in our hand)|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Thus, declarer has three clubs. Elementary, my dear Watson! Declarer's shape is exactly 1-5-4-3. Consequently, partner is 3-3-3-4.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Now that we have worked out all of that information (wasn't it fun?), surely it gives us a better picture as to how to defend this hand accurately?|PC|cac6|

Bidding: Your opponents, West (LHO) - East (RHO) have a seemingly natural auction to a seemingly normal 3NT, but little did they know that they had revealed too much information. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Who could blame them? We'd probably have bid the same way. 

Actually, playing devil's advocate ... it surely isn't unreasonable for East to have removed 3NT to 4@H.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the likelihood that West has a singleton spade to be bidding 3NT, East's abundance of values in both red suits (which are West's two main suits) means that the possibility of a 4@H contract could be better than 3NT as the opponents might well attack spades. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As on this deal, 4@H would certainly have been a better contract, able to take five hearts, four diamonds, and a club.

Oh well, who said Bridge was easy? |

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You are able to deduce the hand distribution of your partner as well as declarer's based on the information that is in front of you. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Better yet, when you are defending you should always get yourself into the habit of trying to visualize the distributions. Sometimes there might not be enough information available to give you the exact distributions, but if you are able to work out an approximation, it will at least help you out in one way or another.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |

If you are having a bit of trouble on this deal, fear not. Always try to go in baby steps, taking in the information one at a time.  |
