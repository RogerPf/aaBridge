^B@2^*BMM: I have the permission to roast our mentor as this is his first 2015 session. Gary, BBO nickname (magicgary) who first spotted the error and handed me the excuse for roasting Howard gets the honorable mention. We blocked the West hand. Please keep track of Spades and Hearts and plays by East. Yes even top experts may err.^*N|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is better if you do it immediately. The idea behind a preempt is to make it hard for the opps to exchange information. So you should preempt immediately to as high a level as you intend to go.|

up|36|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice play. If Mary bids 4@S (which is what I recommend) Judy still doubles and I assume Faye bids 5@D or 5@H. A double of 4@S is neither pure penalty nor pure takeout. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is the infamous and often dangerous "do something intelligent" double. It shows values but nothing specific. So partner has to figure out what to do. That is why we preempt, to make the opponents guess. And they often guess wrong.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It does say you have some tricks and are willing to play 4@S doubled but it is not pure penalty. Partner then can pass with a flat hand. In this board, in fact, with the @SK as a likely trick Faye could consider a pass especially if we were vul.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2 keys in deciding whether or not to pull a "do something intelligent double" are:
^c@2a) length and strength in the opps suit. The shorter you are in their suit, the more you want to bid. If you have a singleton or void, it is usually right to pull. 
^C@2The other reason is how balanced your hand is. The more balanced your hand, the less you want to bid, the more you want to sit. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you have a long suit of your own you might want to bid it. On this hand, had Judy doubled 4@S, Faye has a tough decision. She has a defensive trick in spades, which is a minus for pulling but she has two 5-card suits. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So had the auction gone 3@S-P-4@S-dbl-P-? I would probably decide to pull with Faye's hand given the vulnerability. And I would have bid 4NT which is NOT to play. It is, "partner I have 2 suits". The 2 suits are not necessarily clubs and diamonds because Judy's double does not explicitly promise hearts. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is just any 2 suits. So Judy would pick the better of clubs and diamonds. If she picked diamonds, she must be prepared to have Faye bid hearts. On this hand had the auction gone that way, they end up in 5 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other comment on the play. At trick 3 it is not clear that Mary should cover the @HJ, but if she does, then Faye goes down because I have the @HQ9 over the @H107 in dummy. This illustrates an important finesse principle. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should be reluctant in general to lead an honor from your hand to finesse. The reason being, if the opponent covers, it takes 2 of your honors to knock out 1 of theirs. But on this hand it is not clear how to play the hearts to only lose 1 trick. The @HJ could be right if I am the one with the doubleton honor.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now why I did not bid 1@S as my hand meets Rule 20. I am sure our feisty Kibbers are still here. -:) At that vulnerability, with my nice spades and good 7-3-2-1 distribution, 4@S would not have been unreasonable as a preempt in 1st or 3rd seat.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My hand meets the requirements for Rule 20 opening. However, although I will never pass a hand that meets the rule of 20, I don't always open it at the 1-level. Basically, I will open any hand with 11 or 12 HCP at the 1-level if it meets the rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will preempt with and any hands with less than 10 HCP, meaning I must have a long suit somewhere. It is reasonable for partner to assume I have some defense when I open at the 1-level (although sometimes I might not). The fewer HCP I have, the more the opps have, so preempting is more effective. Therefore,:|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Under 10 I preempt even if it meets the rule of 20

With 10, it depends. If I am 5-5 I usually open at the 1-level since a weak 2 should promise 6. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with 6-4, if my suit is a major, I definitely open a weak 2, unless I have 6-4 in the majors. With 6 clubs, since I cannot open a weak 2 clubs, I open 1@C. With 6 diamonds, it depends on how much defense I have. with little defense I open 2@D (or with 4 clubs).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is NOT forcing, although some students think it is. It is only invitational, partner only bids 4 with a good 8 or more Declarer Points. So 4@H should be a reasonable bid. But there is a better bid as I must force to game. I should bid 4@C.|mb|4C|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That bid says I have 20+ points, 4 hearts, and a singleton (or rarely void) in clubs. If partner has a nice club holding (3 or more with either no honor or the ace), that is a good fit with this hand and that in combination with 10 points or so might produce slam. One more point, a 4@H bid by me denies any shortness.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, here, partner does not like her hand over 4@C. The @CK does not fit well with my hand. Had the @CK been for example, in the heart suit, then her hand is a lot better. Therefore, her best bid now is 4@H.|mb|4H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played. Although we made 7, slam is very iffy. We should always lose a club. It is not a good slam because both red suit finesses work (25%). And if both red suit do not break we will likely lose at least 1 trick in each. In general, you don't want to be in a slam that is less than 50%. and even 50% slams are marginal.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss whether I should open 1@C or 1@D. The reason many experts open my hand 1@D is because they play that when it goes 1@C-P-1@H-P or 1@C-P-1@S-P, 2@C rebid tends to show 6 clubs. |

The Lost Language of Love and Courtship

^-|fp|4|ht|e|at|This is based on a blog |CP|1|AT|^*Hblog.dictionary.com/love-and-courtship/^*N|CP||AT| and I liked it. It goes to opine: To modern ears, the following excerpt from ^*uAnthony Trollope^*N's ^*BHe Knew He Was Right^*N, published in 1869, sounds risqué. Trollope writes: It is not pleasant to make love in the presence of a third person, even when that love is all fair and above board; but it is quite impracticable to do so to a married lady, when that married lady's sister is present.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|

As shocking as those sentences might sound to us, readers in Victorian times would have thought nothing of it. No, this scene does not refer to a sexually voyeuristic experience for the "third person." Rather Trollope writes of chaste courtship, the variety traditionally exercised in sophisticated 19th-century society, often with a chaperone present.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|

As Fraser Sutherland notes in his essay "^*BWhy Making Love Isn't What It Used to Be,^*N" the term make love has undergone a semantic shift over the last several centuries: "In English the phrase early on both referred to wooing and to sexual intercourse…Yet euphemistic usage was firmly entrenched by the early seventeenth century, and remained so into the early twentieth century." In Victorian times, the popularity of the euphemistic sense reflects the cultural niceties of a characteristically subdued society. It wasn't until the 1920s that make love reverted back to its physical sense, which had receded into the fringes of the English language. During an era of female empowerment marked by the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment, make love regained its somewhat forgotten carnal connotations, starting in the United States. This semantic change is not an isolated incident. Sutherland also notes that the term lover experienced a similar shift in these same periods.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|

By the time the phrase "make love, not war" arose as a 1960s anti-war slogan, the Victorian parlor-room-appropriate courtship connotations of make love had long since morphed into something more sexually explicit. Of course in this context, make love also stands in for peace and compassion. For younger generations make love is a loaded expression. While some use it sincerely, others find the use of make love to be sickly saccharine and roll their eyes at its overly sentimental quality.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|

Next time you pick up a Victorian novel involving courtship, keep in mind the evolution of the phrase make love over time. Though these books might be more tame than some readers might have previously thought, there's still plenty of scandal, intrigue, and passion within their pages.|

COMMENTS
Jennifer -  February 14, 2014 - 7:10 am. Referring to the Victorians as a "characteristically subdued society" shows a lack of historical knowledge. They invented the vibrator and sold it in mail-order catalogs. They were not repressed nor subdued by any means. Though the above excerpt almost certainly refers to wooing a lady, the author may have used it specifically knowing that the reader would be savvy enough not to allow his mind to go straight to the gutter and would understand that he/she intended the more chaste meaning.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |

Carly -  February 14, 2014 - 11:01 pm. Jennifer, your logic is clearly flawed if you assume that a few freaks selling sex toys in a catalog set the zeitgeist for the entire era. I'd also point out that, in Victorian society, vibrators were primarily used by doctors as a treatment for "hysteria." Recreational use was much less common, and certainly much less frequently discussed.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

Carly -  February 14, 2014 - 12:01 pm. If you're looking for some ‘gutter' poetry, you need look no further than John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester (Particularly his ‘A Letter From Artemesia in the Town to Chloe in the Country'). If you thought the Victorian's had dirty minds, look back to the 17th century to see where it started growing!|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

Andrew -  February 26, 2014 - 9:54 am. Robyn, my argument was that an anecdotal example of a product sold in a catalog doesn't set the tone of the times. This is evidenced by the fact that this product, while used for recreational purposes today, was used for medical purposes (a phrase that I use loosely) during the period in question. Your list of examples of this "medical" usage seems to lend my point credibility.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

To address your other point, ^*BI'd compare politicians of Victorian times who wanted sewing machines banned because they provoked immoral thoughts to their modern counterparts who don't want girls vaccinated for HPV because it would encourage them to have premarital sex.^*N They both would seek a society wherein conversation on anything below the belt is limited to the church's rhetoric.^*N|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |

andrew, YOUR logic is flawed. Doctors did a booming business treating 'hysteria' with vibrators and 'uterine adjustments, manipulations and message' some politicians wanted treadle sewing machines banned because they provoked immoral thoughts. (^*BAnd now that I am retired I learn all this.^*N)|

Bid 1@C: Almost all experts would consider this a mandatory opening bid. The hand contains only 12 points in high cards, but three Quick Tricks (or defensive tricks). It's true you would prefer that more of the high cards were located within the long suit. A hand with a long, strong major such as AKJ65, A76, 765, 32 would be more promising. Still, open one club.

Bid 3@S: You have found a trump suit but have too little strength to bid four spades, especially since some of your honors may be wasted.

Open 1@H: You may have trouble describing this promising hand. If you open one club and hear a response of one spade, you must stretch (and in the face of a possible misfit) to "reverse" by bidding a red suit. Some players would open one diamond, planning to bid two clubs next. An option is to open one heart, treating the suit as a five-carder.

Rebid 2NT (or 2@S): You have two options. A rebid of two spades would be permissible; it would not promise a longer suit. A bid of 2NT would (in most partnerships) suggest minimum values, but the distribution is not strictly balanced. I would try 2NT, but I have no strong feelings. I would not bid three clubs, which would suggest more strength.

Bid 1@S: You have substantial extra strength. Nevertheless, you must bid only one spade.
