^-|fp||hb|d|wb|b|ip|60|bm|http://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/images/mistysmall.jpg|ht|d|fp||at|^n@2As you all know Misty is the Schutzmans' adorable impish Chihuahua. She has attended all of Howard's mentoring sessions. Along with Ava and Howard she plays with other experts late at night at the Main Bridge Club. She learned bridge so quickly that the K9CBL (K9 Contract Bridge League) has recognized her as a Silicon Life Master.

After receiving that high honor, Movie Maker has asked her to act as a bridge "Dear Abby" fielding questions and problems from BBO students. Please feel free to send your bridge questions either to MM or to Howard. This week's question is from ^*BKia^*N, BBO nickname ^*Bnome^*N.

|HT|p|va|4|at|^B@2
^*BDear Misty^*N: Would you please settle my differences with my two partners. I play a jumpshift with a huge hand, 18-19 points, and game forcing. But what about a 2N rebid as a Jump-shift? I play that it can be passed.

^*BDear nome^*N: It continually amazes me how many "intermediate" human players have problem with a Jump-shift by opener. It shows a very big hand and is GAME FORCING. On the other hand, a 2NT rebid (as a jump-shift) is an obvious exception. That action shows 18-19 balanced, and can be passed.

Mr. Larry Cohen has a short lesson on the subject at his website.  You can find it at his website
|CP|1|AT|^*Hlarryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=22^*N|CP||AT|,

NT|^B@2In this case, the @SQ would be suit preference, presumably showing that North's entry is in hearts.|

NT|^B@2In that case Judy either has 1 or 2 clubs left. Even if Judy has Jx left, the @CQ cannot hurt. And if Faye has the @CJ, it is right to play the @CQ a rare case of 2nd hand high being correct.|pc|CQ|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Judy, when you double, you MUST have at least 3 cards in the unbid suits. What are you doing if I bid hearts. Double does not describe your hand. You have to pass and perhaps come in later.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is why Faye need not duck. She has A10987. I have played the @CQ. That means if she does not duck, we can only take 2 club tricks at most (the @CK and @CJ). But now we can take 3 club tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So remember, it is not always right to duck the first trick. Sometimes if you look carefully you actually have 2 stoppers.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2Yes, on the surface it appears Faye only had 1 club stopper. But careful analysis meant she had 2. It is quite often true that because of intermediate cards, ducking may cost you a 2nd stopper. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2So although ducking is right more often than not you should not do so by rote. You need to analyse the holding you have in the suit to make sure ducking does not cost a trick.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2On the first hand, ducking the spade, as Faye did was absolutely right as I said it is more often than not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mary was right to pass, especially vul, although 2@D surprisingly will work out quite often.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


mb|2C|mb|p|NT||lb|*bYour bid for North please.^^3h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Faye, you either have to bid 2@H right away or 3@H here. You must "support with support." If you think you are ^*Bnot^*N strong enough to how a 3-card limit raise, you must bid 2@H immediately.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2Here is the issue. If it goes 1@H-1@S-2@C-2@H, that usually is just a "preference" for heart and almost always shows 2 hearts because with 3 hearts and a weak hand you should bid 2@H immediately.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2With 3 hearts Faye has to decide if she has a weak raise or a limit raise. With a weak raise she bids 2@H right away. With a limit raise (10-12) and 3-card support she bids a new suit and bids 3@H next.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2She has a limit raise here. She has 9 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, and 1 point for the doubleton = 12 Dummy Points. It s pretty close to a 4@H bid and I would not hate it if she bid 4@H, although I think 3@H is slightly better.|mb|3H|

mb|p|NT||sk|s|lb|*bYour bid for South please.^^4h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In any case, I have a really good hand now. I have 13 HCP, 2 length points, 2 quality suit points, 2 points for singleton, and 1 point for side 4 card suit = 20 Declarer Points once we find a fit. Had she bid 4@H I might think about slam.|mb|4H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally I would say leading an unprotected ace, especially from AQ is not a good lead. But in this case Judy has a problem. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2Diamonds are the only unbid suit and it is usually wrong to lead suits the opps have bid and with Jxx of trump, it is possible leading a trump could give away a trick. So the @DA is a "least of evils" lead and it works well here.|pc|DA|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am making if club and hearts are 3-2. I can also make, as an extra chance, if clubs are 4-1 if the person with 1 club only has 2 hearts. Most people would not give themselves the extra chance but I will.|

There were also many who would never have made the list. My picks for the top 10 influential presidents were based on their historical influence and their actions while in office. This was a tough list to create -- especially once we move past the 7th president. If one more could be added it would be Ronald Reagan |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan^*N|CP||AT|.

As the first President, Washington |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington^*N|CP||AT| couldn't help but set precedents that were followed by later Presidents. His lack of a desire to be seen as a 'monarch' was an extremely important part of creating a citizen President. Also, the fact that he retired after two terms set a precedent only broken by Franklin Roosevelt. After Roosevelt's death, the two-term limit was added as the 22nd amendment to the Constitution.

On the assumption that trumps behave we need to avoid losing two tricks in the red suits. We could simply finesse for both red Queens - that would give us a 75% chance of success.|

The ten-card trump fit (which we knew about) is good news but the mirror distribution (two clubs opposite two and three cards in each red suit in both hands) is unwelcome. |

We could just draw trumps and try our luck with two red suit finesses. We'd be unlucky if both failed - overall we'd have about a 75% chance. However, why risk the contract when there is a 100% chance?|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |

If the opponents lead hearts for us we are home and dry. So the play is to draw trumps, cash the clubs and play three rounds of diamonds. Whatever the opponents do next we have the rest of the tricks. |

Before we play to trick one let's count our tricks.|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Eight clubs and four tricks in aces and kings makes 12. The spade seven in dummy is a well placed menace, and if East has sole control of the red suits (seven hearts and both the diamond honours) he becomes the victim of a simple squeeze.|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How can we do better?|
pc|s6s3|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The answer is that if East has seven hearts there is a double squeeze with diamonds as the pivot suit (the suit in which we keep communication) and hearts and spades each representing a well-placed single menace against the opponent who has to discard before them. |

The critical part of this deal is simple arithmetic. We need East to have sole guard of hearts -- if West can keep hearts and spades guarded then East keeps his diamond honour and the contract must fail.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If our assumptions are right East will have to keep hearts guarded and we must posit that he began with seven. He has followed twice to the ace and king. That leaves five! How many will he discard? Watch this space...|

At this point in the deal we have seen East follow to two hearts and pitch four of them. We know he started with seven of them (if he didn't we are dead). So our last heart is now no longer needed. And our attention switches to West.|

pg| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since West is keeping the spade queen, dummy's seven is not good. That is the bad news. But since East still has the 13th heart and West the 13th spade, neither opponent can have more than one diamond.|

The better (and winning) line is to cash both hearts then run the clubs. This is the ending as the last club is led:|

On the last club East must keep hearts guarded so pitches a diamond. Declarer lets the heart go and catches West in a spade-diamond squeeze.|PC|c3d9h3d5|

Incidentally narrow winners of the second final were Frank To and Bruce Neill, who took advantage of this deal too. To opened 3@C and Neill used Blackwood to get to 6@C. When East saved in 6 @H Neill passed to invite further action and To bid 7 @C when perhaps 6NT might have been wiser. |

Against 7@C the heart lead let declarer cash two hearts to pitch a spade then play spade ace and ruff a spade. He could now use the two club entries to ruff the spades good with the @DA as the late entry to dummy. |

Either minor suit lead would have seen the defense home (a diamond for sure, a trump unless declarer can see through the backs of the cards). For the record 6NT was an 83% board, -100 a 17% result.|
