NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people stretch and open 1N with a good 14. But, your hand, with 4-3-3-3 distribution is not in that category.  I use the following rule:|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of the time I just open 1NT if my HCP are 15-17. But I also count my Bergen Starting Points. If Bergen Starting Points are 16 or more, I will open 1NT even with only 14 HCP. On the other side, I do not open a 17 HCP hand which has 19 Bergen Starting Points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as making the contract,many people would lead either a club or a diamond with my hand. A club makes it easy for Kia to make. Cannot be done on a spade lead.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
vybdt:  Makes once north ducks the diamond. When he was in dummy he should played the @CJ - even though he expects to lose the trick. He needs to hope the club suit comes in and it does. If north plays the A diamonds he always goes down one.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's true. Also, when he was in his had, if Kia leads a low club to the J, he ends up taking 4 club tricks, 1 diamond, 2 hearts and 3 spades for 10 ticks because the C9 comes down in 3 rounds. So Kia and everyone else can experiment playing the hand from here double dummy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But Kia is more aggressive than I am :) and it does give our side a problem. Had kia passed I would bid 3@S to invite to 4. But now my 3@S bid might just be competing.|

texall:  Should I have had doubled?|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No your bidding was fine. I know YOU cannot have 5 spades because you would have overcalled 1@S to start with. Remember, sometimes you can figure out what is going on based on "negative" inferences. Her failing to bid 1@S but the bidding 2@S freely means she has 9ish points at least and 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my Dummy points:
^C16 HCP - 1 for dubious DJ = 15
^C+ 1 for doubleton as dummy = 16
So I will take a chance. However, bidding close games with only an 8-card fit is often iffy. I am not happy as a competitor, that Kia bid 3@D. I am happy as a teacher, however, that Kia bid 3@D :).|mb|4S|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was not the correct choice. I cannot give you a formula as how to pick the proper card here. But I can give you the thinking tools so you can always use it. Here, you have to consider the bidding and look at the dummy.The question would be, should you lead through the weakness or through the strength. Or guess correctly what your partner can have. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, more often than not, you lead through dummy's strength (e.g. when dummy is playing 2nd). You lead into dummy's weakness (e.g when dummy is playing 4th).|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first look at why leading into dummy's weakness is a good idea. Say dummy has the 567 in a suit. When you lead that suit, declarer has to play high. If he does not, then your partner is likely to win a trick with a low card (perhaps even the 8).|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading into dummy's strength is a bit more problematical but still often correct. The reason is, partner can see what dummy's high cards are and can often figure out, if forced to play 3rd hand high, which card to play. |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And leading into strength often does not give anything away. For example, on this hand, if you lead a club, if partner has the @CQ he will win it if declarer plays low. If he does not have the CQ declarer is entitled to 3 club tricks in any case.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to this hand, the reason it is good for you to overtake is because if partner stays on lead, she has no good suit to lead. Dummy's weakest suit is hearts, but it is still pretty strong. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner has a heart honor, leading a heart will give away a trick. So if you leave partner on lead, she will likely make a lead that could give declarer an extra trick. So you should overtake.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what you should lead back. The guideline of leading through dummy's strength is a good one here. If you lead a club you are not likely to give declarer a trick she is not entitled to.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you lead a heart, if partner only holds 1 honor, you could be giving away an extra trick to declarer. So a club lead is likely to either hurt or make no difference. Whereas a heart lead could easily give declarer an extra trick.|

}^-|fp||cs||ht|d|at|^B@2From "A Short History of Nearly Everything"  by Bill Bryson |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything^*N|CP||AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis work is as close as MM can even dream to get close to Cavendish Invitational. Last week in explaining the history of "Mason Dixon Line", we introduced you to how the distance between the Earth and Sun was calculated. This week we borrow material from a large chapter of the book in how the weight of the Earth was determined. Again we let Bill Bryson do the narration with a few changes.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BBill Bryson: ^*N|cp||at|Something else conjectured by Newton in the Principia |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica^*N|CP||AT| was that a plumb bob hung near a mountain would incline very slightly toward the mountain, affected by the mountain's gravitational mass as well as by the Earth's. This was more than a curious fact. If you measured the deflection accurately and worked out the mass of the mountain, you could calculate the universal gravitational constant - that is, the basic value of gravity, known as G - and along with it the mass of the Earth. Maskelyne, the astronomer royal realized that the nub of the problem lay with finding a mountain of sufficiently regular shape to judge its mass. |
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


AT|

We know that in 1772, at Maskelyne's behest, Mason accepted the commission to find a suitable mountain for the gravitational deflection experiment, at length reporting back that the mountain they needed was in the central Scottish Highlands, just above Loch Tay, and was called ^*BSchiehallion^*N ^*Ahttp://tinyurl.com/qbjo4mk^*N|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


at|

[Schiehallion (Scottish Gaelic: Sìdh Chailleann) is a prominent mountain in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Schiehallion has a rich botanical life, interesting archaeology, and a unique place in scientific history for an 18th-century experiment in 'weighing the world'. The mountain's popularity amongst walkers led to erosion on its footpath and extensive repairs were undertaken in 2001.]|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


AT| 

Nothing, however, would induce Mason to spend a summer surveying it. With Mason refusing to survey the mountain, the job fell to Maskelyne. So for four months in the summer of 1774, Maskelyne lived in a tent in a remote Scottish glen and spent his days directing a team of surveyors, who took hundreds of measurements from every possible position. To find the mass of the mountain from all these numbers required a great deal of tedious calculating, for which a mathematician named Charles Hutton was engaged. The surveyors had covered a map with scores of figures, each marking an elevation at some point on or around the mountain. It was essentially just a confusing mass of numbers, but Hutton noticed that if he used a pencil to connect points of equal height, it all became much more orderly. Indeed, one could instantly get a sense of the overall shape and slope of the mountain. He had invented contour lines. |
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


%%%page
NT|^B@2Extrapolating from his Schiehallion measurements, Hutton calculated the mass of the Earth at 5,000 million million tons, from which could reasonably be deduced the masses of all the other major bodies in the solar system, including the Sun. So from this one experiment we learned the masses of the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the other planets and their moons, and got contour lines into the bargain - not bad for a summer's work. |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


AT|

Not everyone was satisfied with the results, however. The shortcoming of the Schiehallion experiment was that it was not possible to get a truly accurate figure without knowing the actual density of the mountain. For convenience, Hutton had assumed that the mountain had the same density as ordinary stone, about 2.5 times that of water, but this was little more than an educated guess.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


AT| 

One improbable-seeming person who turned his mind to the matter was a country parson named John Michell, who resided in the lonely Yorkshire village of Thornhill. Despite his remote and comparatively humble situation, Michell was one of the great scientific thinkers of the eighteenth century and much esteemed for it. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


AT|

Among a great deal else, he perceived the wavelike nature of earthquakes, conducted much original research into magnetism and gravity, and, quite extraordinarily, envisioned the possibility of black holes two hundred years before anyone else - a leap of intuitive deduction that not even Newton could make. When the German-born musician William Herschel decided his real interest in life was astronomy, it was Michell to whom he turned for instruction in making telescopes, a kindness for which planetary science has been in his debt ever since.|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


AT| 

But of all that Michell accomplished, nothing was more ingenious or had greater impact than a machine he designed and built for measuring the mass of the Earth. Unfortunately, he died before he could conduct the experiments and both the idea and the necessary equipment were passed on to a brilliant but magnificently retiring London scientist named ^*BHenry Cavendish^*N. |
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


AT|

^*BCavendish^*N is a book in himself. Born into a life of sumptuous privilege - his grandfathers were dukes, respectively, of Devonshire and Kent - he was the most gifted English scientist of his age, but also the strangest. He suffered, in the words of one of his few biographers, from shyness to a "degree bordering on disease." Any human contact was for him a source of the deepest discomfort. |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


%%Page
NT|^B@2Once he opened his door to find an Austrian admirer, freshly arrived from Vienna, on the front step. Excitedly the Austrian began to babble out praise. For a few moments Cavendish received the compliments as if they were blows from a blunt object and then, unable to take any more, fled down the path and out the gate, leaving the front door wide open. It was some hours before he could be coaxed back to the property. Even his housekeeper communicated with him by letter. |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


AT|

Although he did sometimes venture into society - he was particularly devoted to the weekly scientific soirées of the great naturalist Sir Joseph Banks - it was always made clear to the other guests that Cavendish was on no account to be approached or even looked at. Those who sought his views were advised to wander into his vicinity as if by accident and to "talk as it were into vacancy." If their remarks were scientifically worthy they might receive a mumbled reply, but more often than not they would hear a peeved squeak (his voice appears to have been high pitched) and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish fleeing for a more peaceful corner. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


AT|

His wealth and solitary inclinations allowed him to turn his house in Clapham into a large laboratory where he could range undisturbed through every corner of the physical sciences -  electricity, heat, gravity, gases, anything to do with the composition of matter. The second half of the eighteenth century was a time when people of a scientific bent grew intensely interested in the physical properties of fundamental things - gases and electricity in particular - and began seeing what they could do with them, often with more enthusiasm than sense. |
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


AT|

In America, Benjamin Franklin famously risked his life by flying a kite in an electrical storm. In France, a chemist named Pilatre de Rozier tested the flammability of hydrogen by gulping a mouthful and blowing across an open flame, proving at a stroke that hydrogen is indeed explosively combustible and that eyebrows are not necessarily a permanent feature of one's face. Cavendish, for his part, conducted experiments in which he subjected himself to graduated jolts of electrical current, diligently noting the increasing levels of agony until he could keep hold of his quill, and sometimes his consciousness, no longer. [MM: None as bad as being my bridge partner -:).]|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


AT|

Among much else, and without telling anyone, Cavendish discovered or anticipated the law of the conservation of energy, Ohm's law, Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, Richter's Law of Reciprocal Proportions, Charles's Law of Gases, and the principles of electrical conductivity. That's just some of it. But our interest here is in Cavendish's last known experiment when in the late summer of 1797, at the age of sixty-seven, he turned his attention to the crates of equipment that had been left to him - evidently out of simple scientific respect - by John Michell. |
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


%%%Page
NT|^B@2When assembled, Michell's apparatus looked like nothing so much as an eighteenth- century version of a Nautilus weight-training machine. It incorporated weights, counterweights, pendulums, shafts, and torsion wires. At the heart of the machine were two 350-pound lead balls, which were suspended beside two smaller spheres. The idea was to measure the gravitational deflection of the smaller spheres by the larger ones, which would allow the first measurement of the elusive force known as the gravitational constant, and from which the weight (strictly speaking, the mass) of the Earth could be deduced. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


AT|

Because gravity holds planets in orbit and makes falling objects land with a bang, we tend to think of it as a powerful force, but it is not really. It is only powerful in a kind of collective sense, when one massive object, like the Sun, holds on to another massive object, like the Earth. At an elemental level gravity is extraordinarily unrobust. Each time you pick up a book from a table or a dime from the floor you effortlessly overcome the combined gravitational exertion of an entire planet. What Cavendish was trying to do was measure gravity at this extremely featherweight level. |
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


AT|

Delicacy was the key word. Not a whisper of disturbance could be allowed into the room containing the apparatus, so Cavendish took up a position in an adjoining room and made his observations with a telescope aimed through a peephole. The work was incredibly exacting and involved seventeen delicate, interconnected measurements, which together took nearly a year to complete. When at last he had finished his calculations, Cavendish announced that the Earth weighed a little over 13,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds, or six billion trillion metric tons, to use the modern measure. (A metric ton is 1,000 kilograms or 2,205 pounds.) |
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


AT|

Today, scientists have at their disposal machines so precise they can detect the weight of a single bacterium and so sensitive that readings can be disturbed by someone yawning seventy- five feet away, but they have not significantly improved on Cavendish's measurements of 1797. The current best estimate for Earth's weight is 5.9725 billion trillion metric tons, a difference of only about 1 percent from Cavendish's finding. Interestingly, all of this merely confirmed estimates made by Newton 110 years before Cavendish without any experimental evidence at all.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


AT|

So, by the late eighteenth century scientists knew very precisely the shape and dimensions of the Earth and its distance from the Sun and planets; and now Cavendish, without even leaving home, had given them its weight. So you might think that determining the age of the Earth would be relatively straightforward. After all, the necessary materials were literally at their feet. But no. ^*BHuman beings would split the atom and invent television, nylon, and instant coffee before they could figure out the age of their own planet.^*N|

Bidding: Natural bidding to a normal 4@H contract. |
PG| ***** 247 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: After two rounds of clubs and a trump switch, you should draw the necessary amount of trumps. Given that you only have nine top tricks, you will need to get a tenth from either the spade suit or the diamond suit. Which one should you go for?|
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It's best to attack the diamond suit. If the spade finesses loses, you have almost no recourse for a tenth trick. But if you lose a diamond (by playing, say, three rounds of diamonds) you can see if they break 3-3 or not. |
PG| ***** 249 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If so, you have your tenth trick and if not, you still have the spade finesse in reserve. |
PG| ***** 250 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So after drawing two rounds of trumps, you cash the @DA and play another diamond. When West follows to this second diamond with the lowest outstanding diamond (between the opponents), it is safe to play low from dummy because East will have to win the trick.|
PG| ***** 251 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East happens to have started off with honor doubleton, East is endplayed.|
PG| ***** 252 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East has a safe diamond exit, he will return a diamond. You will then see if diamonds break 3-3, if so (as on this layout) then your fourth diamond will provide you with a spade discard, and if not, you can fall back on the spade finesse. |up|31|

We used its material in full, however, we have improved it by making it more interactive.|

NT|^B@2
You are playing a weak-NT based system on this deal, but don't worry, we will guide you through the bidding.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Firstly, open 1@H with your hand (weak No-trump players tend to play a 4-card major based system).|
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Despite what David Bird says, it is definitely not true that most weak NT players use 4-card majors. In fact, they use 5-card majors. There is a bidding system called "Acol" which was popular many years ago in England. That system uses weak NTs and 4-card majors. But these days it is very rare to find someone who plays 4-card major openings regardless of whether or not they play weak 1N openers.|

Counting our top tricks would be a good start.|
PG| ***** 261 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, we have eight top tricks (@SA, @HAKQJ, @CAKQ) and we have good chances for a ninth. |
PG| ***** 262 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, if Clubs split 3-2 (or if there's a singleton Jack) then you will be able to set up two additional Club tricks. |
PG| ***** 263 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course, that begs the question - what will you do if the Clubs break 4-1?|
PG| ***** 264 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If Clubs split 4-1, then we will be in a bit of trouble.|
PG| ***** 265 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the @S10 opening lead, we can predict that East will be playing a Spade honor. Do we duck, or do we take the Ace? If we duck two rounds of Spades and Clubs break 4-1, then the opponents will be in prime position to cash their remaining Spades as they get on lead with either a Club or the @DA.|
PG| ***** 266 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So let's say we take the @SA at trick one.|
PG| ***** 267 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How can we play the Club suit in such a way that will increase our chances of making this 3NT contract?|
PG| ***** 268 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Hint: With eight top tricks, we only need one additional trick, not two.|

West leads the ten of Spades and East plays the Queen. How will you play?|
PG| ***** 287 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have eight top tricks and if the Clubs come in you will easily bump your total to ten. You must arrange the play so you can survive even if the Clubs break 4-1.|
PG| ***** 288 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Win the first round of Spades. This will leave you with J-3 of Spades in your hand, which will stop the suit effectively if West gains the lead.|
PG| ***** 289 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next you cross to dummy with the King of Hearts and cash the Queen of Hearts. Now comes the key play.|
PG| ***** 290 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You lead a low Club from dummy and finesse the ten. You do not mind whether the finesse wins or loses. When the cards lie as in the diagram, the Club finesse will win, and that will give you ten top tricks. 
|
PG| ***** 291 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What would happen if the Club finesse lost to the Jack?|
PG| ***** 292 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The safe hand would be on lead. He could not play a Diamond or a Spade without giving you an extra trick. On a passive return you would have nine tricks to cash. Note that it is not safe to cross to the Club Ace to finesse in Clubs. If this lost and a Club came back, this would cause a blockage. |
PG| ***** 293 ***** |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I do not completely agree with David Bird's analysis. His line of play does not guarantee the contract. Should the @C10 lose to the @CJ, if East has the @DA, then West can lead a diamond to East's @DA and East can lead a spade through South's @SJ. |
PG| ***** 294 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|The defense would then get 1 club, 1 diamond, and 4 spade tricks and beat the hand by 2 tricks. And if clubs were 3-2, the contract would go down when, in fact, it should make. Having said that, it is hard to say whether playing for 3-2 clubs or using the safety play suggested by David Bird offers a better chance of making.
