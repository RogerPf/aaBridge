^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4 spades is a so-so game and almost difficult to bid. I think Faye does in fact have a pass over 1@D had I not overcalled. Plus Faye was lucky in the heart suit. And they probably end up playing there, and  make 3 or 4.|

If clubs behave and the @CQ comes down I might make more by setting up clubs, but I can't count on that. So setting up diamonds is the way to go. I also have to be careful about unblocking hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on this hand, 3N is a good contract. Once again proving 3N is often as good or better than 5 of a minor. on another point, with margaret's hand, I might bid 4@D to show my shape.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|6@C require either the @CQ to come down, or the @DK ruffing finesse to work. And it turns out on this hand, because clubs are 2-2 and the @DK is onside for the ruffing finesse, we do make 7.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, I am not sure we get there. But just looking at the 2 hands I certainly would like to be in 6@C.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Margaret decide to bid over 3N, she should bid 4@D to show her 5 diamonds and 6 clubs. Because she started with 1@C and then rebid diamonds twice (which is why you started with 1@C) that shows me your distribution - 6 clubs 5 diamonds. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, I am not sure how to get to 6@C even if you bid 4@D over my 3N. With North's hand you cannot rebid clubs. Rebidding the diamonds is the way to show your 6 clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure whether or not I would open Shirley's hand. It does meet the rule of 20 if you use raw HCP. However, if you use Bergen "adusted HCP" Shirley has 12 HCP + 1 quality suit point -1 for @DQJ - 2 for 6 quacks and no A/10. So her hand is worth only 10 "adjusted HCP."|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nevertheless, 1@C was fine as was the rest of the auction. Notice that my negative double promises at least one of the following:
^Ca) a hand too weak to bid 2H or 
^Cb) a good hand with exactly 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had the (b) in this case, although you more often have the (a). A 2@H bid by me promises 5 hearts so I can't bid it even with my strong hand. I must double and then bid new suits.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. Shirley did fine, but I would have made one small adjustment. Once the club finesse works Shirly can count 2 spades, 4 clubs and 2 hearts for sure. She can set up 1 more heart trick (or 2 if the heart finesse works). But she can always set up 2 diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So once the club finesse works, I would play diamonds and knock out the @DA. That way I make at least 4. On this hand I actually make 5 because the @D10 is tripleton so the @D9 sets up. That is a slightly better way to play the hand, although Shirley's approach also guarantees the contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret is playing a short club. That means if she has exactly 4 spades 4 hearts 3 diamonds and 2 clubs she opens 1@C. If you play that, then a 1@D opener promises 4. I am not a big fan of short club. If you play short club, responder should still pass with a hand not strong enough to bid with, even with club shortness.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people play that with 3-3 in the minors they open 1@C regardless of their strength in each suit. If you play that way, then 1@D almost always shows 4 diamonds except when you have the exact distribution that Margaret has. Also a top expert in New England took "better minor" to extremes. He would open Margaret's hand 1@C because, although she only has 2@C, she has an honor in clubs and no honor in diamonds.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if Margaret had the same hand except Ax in diamonds and 3 small clubs he would open 1@D. I think that is a little extreme. Even if you  play better minor, you should open a 3 card suit when you are 3-2 in the minors. On this hand 1@C worked out better. Had Margaret opened 1@D, I was going to bid 2@C to make it harder for them. But she took away my 2@C bid :). |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You do have both red suits, but Faye has 2 points in your red suits. She has more defense than offense. With your hand (with 4-card spades), I would have either bid 2@D over 1@S or passed. Maybe reopening with a double if I bid 2@S and it goes pass pass to you. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the hand looks like a big misfit. Further, I doubt you make 3@D. You have no tricks outside of diamonds. Although if we don't lead diamonds you might make it on a cross ruff. I am not saying Faye would be wrong to bid 3@D, but it is far from clear. All considered then, then bid 2@D to start with or bid 2@D over 2@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You also might be able to beat 2@S although it is not clear. If you play a heart you might give partner a ruff or 2. Although I suspect Shirley will draw trump and play hearts.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|East-West are playing that a direct jump response to 3NT shows 16-17 points. There are a variety of interpretations of this bid, but this is their agreement.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We need a long pause to reflect here. We need five tricks to set these people. Let's figure out how many points partner has and what his lead means. |NT||lb|*mHow many points partner has?^Less than 7~About 8~12 plus^2|cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We know West does not have four. He would have bid them. Pard probably has five since he didn't pre-empt the bidding at his opportunity to open. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
(I told you the bidding would tell you the story.) That means the poor declarer only has three. We are going to have to play the suit carefully to garner (hopefully) five tricks in Hearts.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We took our five Heart tricks and the rest belong to the declarer.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|When we defend, every single card we play should send a message, and thus it is with this hand. Our partner passes at his first opportunity to bid, and when he leads the @H6 we begin our Count and Plan. We count the Heart suit and figure the declarer for three. Why? He didn't respond 1@H to his pard's opening 1@D opener, that's why. He surely can't have four. Since Pard didn't pre-empt, he isn't likely to have six. So there you have it: five for pard and three for declarer.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We pause to look at the dummy, and see that declarer is probably going to set up the Diamonds for five tricks. If Pard has the @DQ, it's toast (aka finessable). So! If we want five tricks, and we sure do, we need to find Pard with the @HA. |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|At trick 1, we smack down our @HK. We now return the @H3. This tells partner that we have an odd number of cards left in the suit. Pard will now know that we started with four. He has the suit counted out too. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Pard wins trick 2 with the lowest Heart he can. Trick 3 is where we can blow the entire thing. If we've been paying attention, we know that if we don't play our @H9 on trick 3, it will take trick 4 and that will be the last trick we take. Look at poor Pard. There's no way back to him! |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We unblock at trick 3, Pard takes tricks 4 and 5 and we very graciously let Them take the rest. Down one because we unblocked. Cool beans! |

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|This looks to be a tricky contract. Given the 1@S overcall, we can expect the @SAQ to be on our left. It looks like we need something favorable to happen in the Diamond suit.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
More specifically, we need to play the Diamond suit for four winners - so we can discard two of our Spades. This will require the @DK to be with West, of course, but what about the @D10? Should you play for Diamonds to be 3-3, or 2-4?|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Now the critical point. Should you ruff and play for Diamonds to be 3-3, or should you run this and play for Diamonds 2-4 with @D10 as East?|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||lb|*yshould declarer ruff?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The probable answer comes with counting out the opponent's hand distribution. What has West shown up with so far?|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has five Spades and a doubleton Heart. For West to have opened the play with the @CQ lead means that he most likely has @CQ-J-10-(x).|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has also shown up with @DK and @D6. This accounts for twelve out of thirteen of West's cards.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That should help you work out the likelihood of the Diamond suit distribution?|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|West leads the Queen of Clubs against your 6@H. When the dummy goes down, you see that partner had nothing to spare for his splinter bid. How will you tackle the play?|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You win the Club lead and draw trumps with the King and Queen, East throwing a Club on the second round. There is no escaping the Diamond finesse. You lead the Jack of Diamonds and this is covered by the King and Ace. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|After returning to the bare Queen of Diamonds, you re-enter dummy with the Ace of trumps. When you lead the nine of Diamonds East follows impassively with the Diamond seven. Should you run the nine or ruff in your hand, playing for the Diamonds to be 3-3?|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|It is not a close decision. West started with seven or eight cards in the majors, compared with East's two or three. Also, West had an easy trump lead from a doubleton, so his actual Club lead surely proclaims a Q-J-10(-x) sequence there. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|He will hold three Diamonds only when he holds five Spades, rather than six, and Q-J-10 bare in Clubs. You should therefore run the nine of Diamonds. On the evidence that you have seen the odds are around 3-to-1 in favour of this play. |
