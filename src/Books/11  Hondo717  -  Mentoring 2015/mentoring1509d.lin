^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay so several things to discus. First should Sue open 3@C? Arguing against preempting is she only has a 6 card suit and she has 2 aces. But arguing for it is they likely have a major suit fit. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think both 3@C and pass are reasonable choices. If I were playing against a strong pair I would open 3@C. If not, I might or might not.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now what should Tom do? Again it is unclear. On the minus side, he doesn't have that great a hand although it is an opener. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But having 3 little clubs is also a small minus. However, that also means that it is likely both Kia and I are short, which means Kia will be able to overruff me.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
WestElsdon:  I use the principle that to overcall at the 3 level I need 16+ points or a long suit 6+.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You really just need an opening hand and a reasonable 5 card suit, especially a major or a 6-card suit. you may be waiting a long time before you get a hand meeting your principle of requiring 16 points.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your hand is a marginal 3 level overcall over a preempt. Pass is ok but so is 3@H. Change one of your hearts to the @H10 and it is a pretty clear overcall.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia: with the same number of points and with the @CK as a king in another suit, has a clear 3@S bid. And even here, 3@S could be right, but his lack of top spades, @CK, and flatfish distribution (no singletons or voids) are probably too many negatives for him to bid. I would pass with Kia's hand.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Tom should raise 3S to 4S, the answer is yes. Although it is true that Kia is balancing and may not quite have an opener, Tom has more than Kia should expect and therefore should bid game. Hie should not be surprised if Kia goes down but he must raise because it is more likely than not that their side can make game.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over a preempt, when partner overcalls he is banking on the fact that on average you will have 7 or 8 points. So unless you have 10+ or you have good distribution (e.g. shortness in their suit and length in pard's suit) you should usually pass.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over preempts bidding is much less scientific. You are now playing the law of averages. That is all you can do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not open it. You know my feeling about light 3rd seat openers, and flat 10 or 11 counts ugh. On the other hand, using the infamous rule of 15 (open if your spades + HCP = 15) mean that some would open kia's hand. I very much disagree with a) the rule and b) opening his hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @CK and @S3 are both reasonable choices. I don't like leading K from KQ empty personally as it often gives away a trick.|

pc|S7|NT||lb|*CWhich card should East play?^^ST^Sat4|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tom, knows Kia has approximately 4 or 5 spades and he cannot see the other spades higher than @S3 - @SK J 9 6 5. If Kia has the @SK it means he led away from the KJ. Possible but unlikely. Because leading away from KJ on opening lead is usually a bad idea.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I guess he could have led away from the king only and I could have the @SJ. So Kia probably has 4 or 5 spades to one honor. If he has 5 spades to the king then the ace may be right because you would lose a spade trick since that would give me @SJx.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with any other holding, the @SA is probably the wrong play especially if I hold the @SK. This was a long winded way of saying that the @S10 is going to be right (or make no difference) more often than the @SA.|
