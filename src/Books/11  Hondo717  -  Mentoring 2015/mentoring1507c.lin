^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I clearly have a game forcing hand. A splinter bid here is a possibility. If I bid 4@C, that shows 4+ spades and a singleton (or rarely a void) in clubs. The problem with that bid is it takes up a lot of room. So, if you have more than a minimum opener (17+ dummy points) you should bid Jacoby 2N even if you have a singleton.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
lcmdir: Is splinter better than Jacoby 2NT here?|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It probably is. Let me count my Dummy Points. 12 HCP, 1 length point, and 3 for singleton (you count 3 for singleton with 4+ card support. Otherwise with 3 card support singletons count 2) for a total of 16 Dummy Points. My hand, therefore, is top of the range for a splinter bid.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||md|skj75h953ctdakj96|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, for example, if I made the @HA the @DA and the @D3 the @H3 (meaning my diamond suit is @DAKJ96 as you see above), now I would be too strong because I have a quality diamond suit, which could be worth a lot of tricks. In in that case I would bid 2N rather than 4@C.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, although I have a nice hand, it is not that nice, so I think 4@C is fine. Now, before I bid it let me discuss what partner should do over a splinter. A splinter lets you discover whether or not you have a good fit.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have no wasted values in responder's short suit, that is great, and you can often make slam with less than 30 HCP. That means if you have 3 or 4 small, or A-third or A-4th, that is the ideal holding.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, Margaret should very much dislike her @CKQ and bid 4@S and hope we don't go down. On the other hand, had I bid 4@D, now Margaret should like her hand more.|

mcannon:  Had you bid 2N - I only have one bid 4@Ss, right?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Had I bid 2N, Margaret having no singletons and a weak hand, uses the "fast arrival" bid of 4@S. As you saw 4@S was not cold because of the bad fit.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you are in a game forcing auction, you need to understand the principle of "fast arrival." That principle says, the faster you get to game, the weaker your hand. The reason being is that, with a stronger hand, over 2N Margaret would still want to look for slam. But with a weak hand, as she has, she is not interested in slam unless I have 18+ and she would bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point of the hand is Margaret needed to plan out her entries better. And managing your entries so that you can take the finesse twice if needed.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a non heart lead, if Kadu has the @CA, Margaret can either pitch her 2 heart losers on the @KQ of clubs, or if Kadu ducks the @CA she will not lose a club. But once she gets a heart lead, her only hope is that east has the @DQ. So, after drawing trump she needs to make sure she is in her hand so she can finesse for the @DQ.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
mcannon:  I knew when he lead the @HK he had the @Q. Should I play the @HA on the first trick?|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your heart play was ok Margaret, although it did not really gain you a trick since you can ruff the 3rd heart, and the discard on the @HA does you no good.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let me discuss both the bidding and the play. First the bidding. Some of you might feel that Margaret should open 1@S. But as most of you know, I (and virtually all experts) advocate opening 1NT with a 5-card major when you are 5-3-3-2 with 15-17. Otherwise you can never get your point count across. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on this hand, despite the 8 card fit it works better. If she opens 1@S I bid 2@S, she bids 3@S (or makes some other game try) and I bid 4@S. 2NT is just as good a contract as 3@S or the 4@S we probably get to.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to how to play the hand. You must plan out the hand. You do that by counting your winners and coming up with a plan to get to 8 winners if you can. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, with the diamond lead, Margaret can count 3 diamonds, and 3 aces for 6 tricks. She needs 2 more. Probably the easiest way to get 2 more is to play for a 3-2 spade break (although that does not happen to work here). |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, I would first try and get my other 2 tricks in spades, by playing a low spade. Jay wins and let us say he plays another diamond. Margaret wins and plays another low spade, getting the bad news. Now she only has 2 spades at most so needs another trick. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So Kadu wins, if she plays a spade Margaret can win and play another spade. If Kadu plays a heart Margaret can duck. And if Kadu plays a club (not a good play) Margaret can win in dummy play another spade and give Kadu her 3rd spade trick. In any case she takes 2 clubs 3 diamonds 1 heart and 2 spades for 8 tricks.|

With 5-4 in the majors, and a weak hand where you don't intend to invite you should simply transfer into your 5-card major as Margaret did pass partner's bid.

The ^*BBastille^*N, built in 1379 under the rule of Charles V, is best known for its role in the French Revolution. In the 17th century, the Bastille became a state prison that held political prisoners. July 14, 1789, marks the Storming of the Bastille. On this day a crowd of revolutionaries captured the prison in a historic demonstration against the existing political order. The French first celebrated Bastille Day as a national holiday in 1880 to commemorate the event recognized as the beginning of the French Revolution. More broadly, the word bastille refers to any prison or jail, or a fortified tower, as of a castle.|

The ^*Bguillotine^*N is the decapitation device famously used in France for official executions. It gets its name from the physician Joseph-Ignace Guillotine, who was a proponent of executions being as quick and painless as possible, and who helped pass a law in 1789 requiring all executions be done by machine. The French government used the guillotine for executions as late as 1977. In 1981, France abolished capital punishment, and along with it, did away with beheadings by means of the guillotine.|

In pre-Revolutionary France, the ^*Bbourgeoia^*N, or professionals of the middle class, were part of the Third Estate--the First and Second Estates were made up of the clergy and nobility, respectively. The term bourgeois comes from the Old French borjois meaning "town dweller." When the term bourgeois first entered English in the 1500s, it referred to the French middle class. However, over time, its meaning extended to include middle classes in other countries, as well. By the late-1800s, bourgeois was appropriated by communist and socialist theorists to refer to capitalists.|

While ^*Bbrioche^*N, a term referring to a type of sweet French bread, didn't enter the English language until the 1820s, this small cake played a large role in public opinion during the French Revolution. The infamous phrase "Let them eat cake!" attributed to Marie-Antoinette translates into "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche!" in French. This notorious shout by the clueless queen consort was in response to the March on Versailles on October 5, 1789, by a mob of angry peasants to protest the high price and scarcity of bread.|

The ^*BReign of Terror^*N, or La Terreur in French, lasted from September 5, 1793, to July 27, 1794. During this time the Committee of Public Safety, under the leadership of the radical Maximilien de Robespierre, executed around 17,000 people suspected of counterrevolutionary leanings. The Great Terror was a short and particularly bloody period of the Reign of Terror in which about 1,400 people were executed. Robespierre was ultimately guillotined without a trial on July 28, 1794, going down in history as a blood-thirsty dictator.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|This contract at first looks a bit easy. You will draw trumps, play off the @DQ, @DA, @DK to discard a Club, and take the Spade finesse.

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|North's 3@H set the trump suit and the next two bids were cue-bids, suggesting a slam and showing the Ace or King of the suit bid. (Some players prefer to cue-bid only when they hold the Ace of a suit.) How would you play 6@H when West leads a trump?|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid bird: ^*N|cp||at|With a 6-4 trump fit, it is obvious to think of elimination play. On this particular deal, though, you must be careful with your entries. Win the trump lead in dummy and immediately play the Queen and Ace of Diamonds. Ruff a Diamond high and only now play a second round of trumps to the dummy.|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Next you play the King of Diamonds, discarding one of your Clubs. This allows you to eliminate the Club suit by playing the Ace of Clubs and ruffing dummy's last Club in your hand.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDAvid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Finally you cross to dummy with a third round of trumps. Both minor suits have been eliminated, so when you play a Spade to the Jack and Queen West is end-played.

Partner leads a low Spade,  but is it from the @SQ or the @SK. We aren't sure. We do know though that partner's holding a major King is the only way we can set the contract.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |

At trick 1, we take our @SA and at trick 2, we lead the @HA, which asks partner "Do you have the @HK?" Partner's @H2 says "Sorry, Pal." |

At trick 3, we return a Spade, hoping that partner holds the @SK. He does, as the fact that our @SJ holds proves. After that, it's all over. There are no more tricks available to us, but hooray, three is plenty.|
