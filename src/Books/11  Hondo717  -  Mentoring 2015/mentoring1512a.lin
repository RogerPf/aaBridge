^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let us discuss the several options Sue has after 2@S pre-empt. The 3@H understates the value of her hand probably by 4 or 5 points. She really wants partner to raise with 6 points and 3 card support and partner won't do that when she bids 3@H. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Her proper choices for bid are:
^Ca). Double and correct to 3@H - be my choice. Normally that would show a 6-card suit, but a 5-card suit with 3 honors is close enough.
^cb). The other choice is to bid 2NT showing 15-18. Yes, she has a singleton diamond, but with a doubleton diamond she would bid 2N so a singleton is not that bad.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
scubagirl0:  Why won't partner raise to 4@H as you said?|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 3@H partner should not raise unless she has close to an opener. When you bid 3@H, you are basically counting on her, by the law of averages, to have around 8 points. If you want her to raise with 6 points, that means you couldn't bid 3@H unless you had 18 or so. And if you wait to bid with 18 points you are going to be passing most preempts. Your 3@H bid only promises a nice opening hand.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you are going to bid that way Kia, you might as well overcall 2NT to start with I think the 2 alternatives are to either double and correct to hearts (my choice) or bid 2N.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let us discuss a slight improvement in the play. Sue wants to ruff a spade.So, although 2nd hand low is usually right even by declarer, in this case it is better if she plays the @SA, plays a spade to the king, and ruffs a spade.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally against a suit contract I try to avoid leading away from honors unless I have no better lead. Leading a heart could be right if I have the A or Q but it also could give away a trick as it does on this hand. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer leading suits where I have nothing because then I am not giving declarer any finesses that they cannot take themselves. So personally I would have led a diamond, but on some hands a heart could work out better.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead should be a diamond. As to which one, it depends on style and this holding is more complicated than most. Playing the way most students play (top of nothing from 3 or 4 small), the @D10 is probably what they would lead. However, the @D10 is sort of a "half honor" so, even when playing top of nothing, I don't lead the 10 as  I don't want to waste it. I lead the @D7. Of course, I prefer leading count, even from 3 small, so I lead @D2.|

But defense is always harder than declaring, which is another reason why you should prefer bidding to defending.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of important points on the hand. First of all, when partner makes a takeout double, it is up to responder to show when they have a strong hand. With 10 points Jo An should bid 3@H and with an opener, as she had, 4@H is correct. 2@H is limited to 8 or a bad 9 at most.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The second point is how to play the trump suit. In general, when missing an honor, the preempter is more likely to be short, so you should finesse the preempter's partner for any missing honors. That is even true if you have a 9-card fit missing the queen. "8 ever 9 never" is not really a good rule.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However on this hand one of the kibs pointed out why the finesse is not a good play and he or she was right. The reason being, declarer knows that if the finesse loses, I can give partner a diamond ruff. Then we can switch to a spade before the @CA is knocked out and declarer will end up losing 1 spade, 1 heart, 1 diamond ruff, and the @CA for down 1.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this particular hand, the heart finesse was incorrect because if it loses, then the hand will go down. Whereas playing the @HA and the @HK means the contract always makes 4 (because the diamond ruff will be the natural trump trick that we would win anyway).|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few kibs questioned my opening 2@D. However, not vul against vul, I stand by my 2@D preempt. I would have preferred better distribution (like a singleton) but I have to bid the cards I am dealt.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see, we did go down in large part due to my flat distribution. If we get anything but a diamond lead, it is possible to make the hand because Sue will have time to pitch a losing diamond on the @CQ, but we do have 4 losers off the top. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it is not an "official" Bergen hand evaluation rule, if you want to deduct 1 point for 4-3-3-3 distribution, that would be fine. If I did that I would only have 9 HCP, not quite enough for a limit raise. Over a limit raise, Sue certainly has enough to bid 4@S. She should discount the @DJ as worthless. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even so, she has 13 HCP (not counting the @DJ), 1 length point is 14. We might only have 24, but vul in imps I think 4@S is ok. In match points however, where the game bonuses doesn't matter as much, I might pass with her hand because note it is also reasonably flat. And the doubleton AK of clubs is not great. Having half your points in your shortest suit is a bad thing. You much prefer to have your HCP in your longer suits.|

^Ca) 5 of a minor is rarely better than 3NT and is often worse

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner's rarely have voids, and it is ok to assume partner has a singleton at least in your long suit. In this case, opposite a small singleton, Faye probably still only has 2 spade losers at most, so she is willing to play in spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You did your best Faye. As it is unlikely we are going to duck our diamond. But you probably should have played a diamond from your hand towards the @DK early on in case Jo An decided to play 2nd hand low. However, since Jo An knows that the @DA is the setting trick, using my exception to 2nd hand low, Jo An should play the @DA when Faye leads a diamond from her hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Faye had a somewhat bad fit with having wasted club points. Her @CQ would have been much better as the @SQ for example. The bidding was fine. and the contract is not hopeless. It is possible, with either a 2-2 break, or Jo An having a singleton spade honor, to not lose any spade tricks.|

Play: Don't tell me you even thought about finessing the @CQ! You have a "gimme". |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|
Win the opening lead with the @CA and draw trumps. Assuming trumps break 2-2 or 3-1, play three rounds of hearts discarding a club from dummy. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The reason why you should discard a club from dummy is because you want to reduce dummy's clubs to the same number as your hand. This way, when you next exit with a club, the club suit will then be eliminated.  Whoever wins the club trick has to break diamonds or give you a ruff-and-sluff. Either way you only lose two more tricks. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The bottom line: After a hand has been stripped, equally-divided side suits can be used as "throw-in" suits, to force a lead in another suit. Here, you have an unequally divided side suit (clubs) in which you can turn it into an equally divided suit by using a heart winner, and subsequently will you then be able to use the club suit itself as your throw-in suit. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anytime you have a side suit of J x x (x) facing Q x x, you want to try and force your opponents to play that suit for you. By the way, if it so happens that you are faced with an unlucky 4-0 trump split, you will have to stop drawing trumps and work on the diamond (side) suit by playing a low one from dummy and hope that the @D10 is onside.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|How can we go about fulfilling this contract? We, of course, start with the Count and Plan regime. With five top tricks (@HAK, @DAK, @CA), we need to search for four additional tricks. It seems a bit easy to identify which suit those four tricks are going to come from. |

You should win the Heart lead in hand so you can keep the @HK as a later entry to dummy's Spades (when the suit becomes established).|

Looks like West started off with a doubleton Spade, just like you. That leaves East who started off with four Spades. No matter - three rounds of Spades have just been played. When dummy gets on lead, the @SQ will draw East's final Spade, and the @S7 will therefore become a winner.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|West leads the @H3 against your 3NT and the first thing you should (always) be doing is to Count and Plan. You can count five top tricks (two Hearts, two Diamonds, one Club) and therefore need to set up four additional tricks. They can be obtained either in Spades or Diamonds, but given that the Spade suit offers more tricks than does Diamonds, the natural reaction is to set your mind on the Spades. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Before planning the timing of your play, you should be thinking about how you will play the Spade suit. You have the @SK, @SQ, @SJ, and @S10 and using those honors, you can force your way to at least three tricks by knocking out your opponent's @SA. There is, however, a slight catch. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the Spade honor cards spread between your hand and dummy's, you should remember to unblock your honor(s) from the short side first. What this means is, to untangle the Spade suit, you should first lead out your @SJ and follow it up by leading a small one to one of dummy's spade honors. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The incorrect way to play the Spade suit would be to lead the @S6 to the @SK, and then the @S5 to your @SJ. If the opponents refuse to take the @SA then, after winning the @SJ, you will find yourself stuck in your own hand. |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now that we know how to tackle the Spade suit, we now go back to how we are going to plan the timing of your play. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the @H3 lead, should you win this trick in dummy or in your hand? |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


AT|

Since you might need an entry back to dummy to cash those winning Spades, you should preserve the @HK in dummy and win the opening lead in your hand. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That way, if you then play the @SJ (defense withholds the @SA), then a Spade to dummy's @SK (defense withholds the @SA once again), you can continue plugging away with dummy's top Spades until the @SA is knocked out, and you can later return back to dummy with the @HK.|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Notice how effective this defense of not taking Aces is. You need to store that one in your mind for future use. |
