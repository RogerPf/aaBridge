^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have an interesting challenge here. The heart is a nice lead for the defense as it turns out. My guess would be that West either has a singleton or small doubleton in hearts, as leading away from Qxx or Jxx is dangerous. So my plan is to hope that hearts are 2-2 and set up clubs.|pc|HT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was pretty lucky on that hand. I could easily go down in 4 if hearts are not 2-2 and clubs are not 3-3.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H would be invitational, 11 ish points. Upon further reflection, I agree that my original 2@H bid was an underbid and I should have bid 3@H. That is not forcing, but North has a clear raise to 4@H with her hand.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people think the auction 1@D-1@H-2@C-3@H, that 3@H is forcing. But it is definitely NOT forcing (although highly invitational and not passed often). The reason it is not forcing is because if I have a forcing to game hand with lots of hearts I bid 2@S, 4th suit forcing, first and then hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a good rule to follow. 4@S over 4@H is almost always right if you have a 9+ card spade fit. Since East's 1@S promises 5 spades (she would have doubled with 4 spades) West has a clear 4@S bid. Not to mention 6-4 is wonderful distribution.|mb|4S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the bidding. As far as the play goes, once I don't lead a heart, East should simply over take the @CK with the @CA, play 2 more clubs pitching hearts, and end up losing a spade or 2 and make 5 or 6.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, a singleton lead is not as good as on the last hand. It could work, but the problem is North only has 2 trump. So I need either the @SA or the @HA for it to work out. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, although singletons can be good leads, they are more speculative if you don't have a trump trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played West. I was just curious, if East bids 3@H do you bid 4@H?|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|
dragonfy:  Debateable. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have only bid 3@H with East's hand but I would bid 4@H with West's. So we would get to the same spot via a different route.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that I never suggested that East bid spades. It certainly should cross her mind, but "support with support" is always a good bidding principle to follow. Therefore, raising hearts is better than bidding spades on this auction.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And perhaps I should bid 5@C. If North had bid 4@C I might, because then I think we have a 10-card fit. But with a flat hand and only a 9 card club fit, I wasn't as eager to bid 5@C. However, North should bid 5@C we are not vul against vul opps, and he has no defense.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 5@C, we lose 2 hearts, 1 spade, and 2 diamonds probably for down 3. 5@H and 5@S both make. BTW, when partner opens 1 of a minor and you have to make a competitive decision with no further information about opener's hand you should assume partner has at least a 4-card suit in the minor.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That will be true almost 90% of the time. So from a law of total tricks perspective, North, with 6 clubs, should assume a 10-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good pass by East. With only 5 HCP and a singleton spade, pass is better. Some people would bid 1N with East's hand, but that is not as good as pass. When you suspect a misfit, stop bidding as soon as you can when you don't have the points for game.|

NT||lb|*bMake a bid for South.^^2h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is, how many hearts should I bid and what does 1@H vs. 2@H vs 3@H mean. 2@H and 3@H are not preemptive. Because with a preempt, I should pass and let them play 1@S.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this situation, normally I would bid 3H with my hand. But I don"t like my 4 spades, so I am bidding 2@H which should show around 11-14 or so with 6 hearts usually.|mb|2H|

mb|3C|MB|d|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an interesting bid. You have only 2 club tricks. Why do you think you are  beating 3@C? Do you think I have 3 tricks?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is very possible, but how are you planning on taking 5 tricks? |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have an interesting decision to make. Because West bid the black suits, it is likely, if pard doesn't have the @HQ that East does  my hearts are probably running. Further, I have 4 spades which means there is danger of a spade ruff in 4 hearts. Therefore, I will pass 3N although 4@H could easily be right.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing the @HA is very wrong although normally you might play for the drop. But, on this hand, a) based on the bidding West is short in hearts and b) you have no entries to my hand if the @HQ does not drop. You cannot always follow the rules for a specific suit. You have to plan the whole hand out.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the N/S bidding and play. Let us discuss West's opening bid. With 5 clubs and 5 spades, the modern theory is to open 1@S. But with a 5 card major and 6 card minor, you try and open your 6 card minor. Sometimes, you have to open your 5 card major if your hand is not good enough to reverse.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example with 5 hearts and 6 diamonds, you might open 1@H because if you open 1@D and pard bids 1@S, 2H is a reverse. But even then, with a 6-5 hand you only need 12 HCP or so to qualify for a reverse and with 5 spades and a 6 card minor it is easier. Because it is likely especially if your suits are clubs and spades, that you will get to rebid 1@S and not have to reverse. Not to mention that West is close to reverse strength anyway.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think the better opening bid is 1@C with West's hand as it is not likely to get her in trouble and allows her to show her distribution by bidding 1@C and then spades twice.|

^B@2^*BBill Bryson: ^*N|cp||at|Something else conjectured by Newton in the Principia was that a plumb bob hung near a mountain would incline very slightly toward the mountain, affected by the mountain's gravitational mass as well as by the Earth's. This was more than a curious fact. If you measured the deflection accurately and worked out the mass of the mountain, you could calculate the universal gravitational constant - that is, the basic value of gravity, known as G - and along with it the mass of the Earth. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

Bouguer and La Condamine had tried this on Peru's Mount Chimborazo, but had been defeated by both the technical difficulties and their own squabbling, and so the notion lay dormant for another thirty years until resurrected in England by Nevil Maskelyne, the astronomer royal. |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|

In Dava Sobel's popular book Longitude, Maskelyne is presented as a ninny and villain for failing to appreciate the brilliance of the clockmaker John Harrison, and this may be so, but we are indebted to him in other ways not mentioned in her book, not least for his successful scheme to weigh the Earth. Maskelyne realized that the nub of the problem lay with finding a mountain of sufficiently regular shape to judge its mass. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|

At his urging, the Royal Society agreed to engage a reliable figure to tour the British Isles to see if such a mountain could be found. Maskelyne knew just such a person - the astronomer and surveyor ^*BCharles Mason^*N. Maskelyne and Mason had become friends eleven years earlier while engaged in a project to measure an astronomical event of great importance: the passage of the planet Venus across the face of the Sun. The tireless Edmond Halley had suggested years before that if you measured one of these passages from selected points on the Earth, you could use the principles of triangulation to work out the distance to the Sun, and from that calibrate the distances to all the other bodies in the solar system. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

Unfortunately, transits of Venus, as they are known, are an irregular occurrence. They come in pairs eight years apart, but then are absent for a century or more, and there were none in Halley's lifetime. But the idea simmered and when the next transit came due in 1761, nearly two decades after Halley's death, the scientific world was ready - indeed, more ready than it had been for an astronomical event before. |
PG| ***** 140 ***** |

The next transit will [be on June 8, 2004, with a second in 2012]. There were none in the twentieth century.|

With the instinct for ordeal that characterized the age, scientists set off for more than a hundred locations around the globe - to Siberia, China, South Africa, Indonesia, and the woods of Wisconsin, among many others. France dispatched thirty-two observers, Britain eighteen more, and still others set out from Sweden, Russia, Italy, Germany, Ireland, and elsewhere. |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|

It was history's first cooperative international scientific venture, and almost everywhere it ran into problems. Many observers were waylaid by war, sickness, or shipwreck. Others made their destinations but opened their crates to find equipment broken or warped by tropical heat. Once again the French seemed fated to provide the most memorably unlucky participants. Jean Chappe spent months traveling to Siberia by coach, boat, and sleigh, nursing his delicate instruments over every perilous bump, only to find the last vital stretch blocked by swollen rivers, the result of unusually heavy spring rains, which the locals were swift to blame on him after they saw him pointing strange instruments at the sky. Chappe managed to escape with his life, but with no useful measurements. |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


AT|

Unluckier still was Guillaume Le Gentil, whose experiences are wonderfully summarized by Timothy Ferris in Coming of Age in the Milky Way . Le Gentil set off from France a year ahead of time to observe the transit from India, but various setbacks left him still at sea on the day of the transit - just about the worst place to be since steady measurements were impossible on a pitching ship. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

Undaunted, Le Gentil continued on to India to await the next transit in 1769. With eight years to prepare, he erected a first-rate viewing station, tested and retested his instruments, and had everything in a state of perfect readiness. On the morning of the second transit, June 4, 1769, he awoke to a fine day, but, just as Venus began its pass, a cloud slid in front of the Sun and remained there for almost exactly the duration of the transit: three hours, fourteen minutes, and seven seconds. |
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


AT|

Stoically, Le Gentil packed up his instruments and set off for the nearest port, but en route he contracted dysentery and was laid up for nearly a year. Still weakened, he finally made it onto a ship. It was nearly wrecked in a hurricane off the African coast. When at last he reached home, eleven and a half years after setting off, and having achieved nothing, he discovered that his relatives had had him declared dead in his absence and had enthusiastically plundered his estate. |

^B@2In comparison, the disappointments experienced by Britain's eighteen scattered observers were mild. Mason found himself paired with a young surveyor named ^*BJeremiah Dixon^*N and apparently they got along well, for they formed a lasting partnership. Their instructions were to travel to Sumatra and chart the transit there, but after just one night at sea their ship was attacked by a French frigate. (Although scientists were in an internationally cooperative mood, nations weren't.) Mason and Dixon sent a note to the Royal Society observing that it seemed awfully dangerous on the high seas and wondering if perhaps the whole thing oughtn't to be called off. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|

In reply they received a swift and chilly rebuke, noting that they had already been paid, that the nation and scientific community were counting on them, and that their failure to proceed would result in the irretrievable loss of their reputations. Chastened, they sailed on, but en route word reached them that Sumatra had fallen to the French and so they observed the transit inconclusively from the Cape of Good Hope. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

On the way home they stopped on the lonely Atlantic outcrop of St. Helena, where they met Maskelyne, whose observations had been thwarted by cloud cover. Mason and Maskelyne formed a solid friendship and spent several happy, and possibly even mildly useful, weeks charting tidal flows. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|

Soon afterward, Maskelyne returned to England where he became astronomer royal, and Mason and Dixon - now evidently more seasoned - set off for four long and often perilous years surveying their way through 244 miles of dangerous American wilderness to settle a boundary dispute between the estates of William Penn and Lord Baltimore and their respective colonies of Pennsylvania and Maryland. The result was the famous ^*BMason and Dixon line^*N, which later took on symbolic importance as the dividing line between the slave and free states. (Although the line was their principal task, they also contributed several astronomical surveys, including one of the century's most accurate measurements of a degree of meridian - an achievement that brought them far more acclaim in England than the settling of a boundary dispute between spoiled aristocrats.) |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

Back in Europe, Maskelyne and his counterparts in Germany and France were forced to the conclusion that the transit measurements of 1761 were essentially a failure. One of the problems, ironically, was that there were too many observations, which when brought together often proved contradictory and impossible to resolve. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|
^B@2The successful charting of a Venusian transit fell instead to a little-known Yorkshire-born sea captain named James Cook, who watched the 1769 transit from a sunny hilltop in Tahiti, and then went on to chart and claim Australia for the British crown. Upon his return there was now enough information for the French astronomer Joseph Lalande to calculate that the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun was a little over 150 million kilometers. (Two further transits in the nineteenth century allowed astronomers to put the figure at 149.59 million kilometers, where it has remained ever since. The precise distance, we now know, is ^*B149.597870691 million kilometers^*N.) The Earth at last had a position in space. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT|
 
As for Mason and Dixon, they returned to England as scientific heroes and, for reasons unknown, dissolved their partnership. Considering the frequency with which they turn up at seminal events in eighteenth-century science, remarkably little is known about either man. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


AT|

No likenesses exist and few written references. Of Dixon the Dictionary of National Biography notes intriguingly that he was "said to have been born in a coal mine," but then leaves it to the reader's imagination to supply a plausible explanatory circumstance, and adds that he died at Durham in 1777. Apart from his name and long association with Mason, nothing more is known. |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


AT|

Mason is only slightly less shadowy. We know that in 1772, at Maskelyne's behest, he accepted the commission to find a suitable mountain for the gravitational deflection experiment, at length reporting back that the mountain they needed was in the central Scottish Highlands, just above Loch Tay, and was called ^*BSchiehallion^*N. Nothing, however, would induce him to spend a summer surveying it. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|

He never returned to the field again. His next known movement was in 1786 when, abruptly and mysteriously, he turned up in Philadelphia with his wife and eight children, apparently on the verge of destitution. He had not been back to America since completing his survey there eighteen years earlier and had no known reason for being there, or any friends or patrons to greet him. A few weeks later he was dead. |

PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The bidding was relatively straight-forward. When East overcalled our pard's opener with the Diamond preempt, we were not deterred. After all, we have an opening bid opposite our partner's, and a lovely five card suit. Pard had a fit, so we ended up in a Heart game contract. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Our initial Count and Plan showed only three losers: one Spade and two Diamonds. But we listened to the bidding and realized that West would be ruffing the third round of Diamonds also. Not good news. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here's a little rule of thumb. When declarer is threatened with an overruff and when dummy only has one more card in the suit being ruffed, it is often a good strategy to play a loser on a loser. This hand is a good example. Let's play it through. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Tricks 1 and 2 go to the defenders Diamonds, and at trick 3, we face a choice: Should we trump or should we dump? Visualize. If we were to trump low, West would take the trick, and we'd still have our Spade loser at the end. That equals four tricks. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


qx||NT|^B@2
If we trump high, West's @HJ grows up and we lose a fourth trick. If, however, we dump the Spade loser, we lose the trick, but no more. Should "they" continue the Diamonds, dummy can overruff and we'll have no trump losers either. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So at trick 3, we drop a losing Spade. We win the Spade return at trick 4 (why a Spade? Nothing else was attractive for them), pull trumps, cash our winners and call it a day. |
