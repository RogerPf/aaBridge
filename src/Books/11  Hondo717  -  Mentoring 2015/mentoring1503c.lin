^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss with 6-4 what Judy should bid over 2@C. Here is what I do. If I have 6 spades and 4 hearts I bid 2 hearts, preferring to show my other major over showing my 6th spade. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if I had 6 spades and 4 diamonds, I bid 2@S to show my 6th spade which I think is more important. However some people prefer to show their 4-card suit regardless.|mb|2H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying you are wrong Faye, but you do realize that playing 2 over 1, 3@H is a slam try? The reason being is that "fast arrival" applies on this auction.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The quicker you bid 4 hearts, the weaker your hand is (given you already promised an opener). In this case, let us count your dummy points. 11 HCP, 1 length point, 2 doubletons for total of 14. I would say you need at least 16 or a good 15 to make a slam try. So 4@H is probably a better bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite the awful break you made the hand. Well done. This is a case where Mary started out with a pretty nice hand, but it got very bad very fast as the auction proceeded.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
As far as Judy's rebid. Her 2 choices are 1N and 2@D. I don't like to rebid 1N with a singleton spade unless I have no other good alternative because 1N does promise 2@S. On this hand, with her very nice diamonds, Judy has a perfectly good 2@D bid. Even opposite a singleton in my hand, she is likely to only have 2 losers in the suit at worst.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have at least 2 better bids IMO. 1NT is the bid most players would choose and is very reasonable. The other choice is 2@S. On this auction 2@S generally shows 4. but with certain hands it is ok to raise with 3-card support such as when you have a singleton or even a small doubleton.|

mb|1N|mb|p|NT||lb|*bYour bid for West please.^^4s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mary, you know Faye has at least 2 spades. That assures you of at least an 8 card fit. Let us count your Bergen Declarer Points and hopefully you will see why passing 1NT is not a good idea.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have 10 HCP, -1 for @HJ, plus 2 length points, plus 1 quality suit point, plus 2 for the singletons, and plus 1 for the 4-card side suit giving you a total of 15 Declarer Points.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, you should bid 4@S - at least 3@S. True, if partner has the wrong hand, such as a small doubleton in spades, it could go down. I would not hate 3@S invitational, but I would bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |

NT|^B@2
He would say your hand is worth 22 or 23. It has a 5 card quality suit. It also has 6 quick tricks which is a huge number. You probably won't get another 6 quick trick hand for 6 months.|

Like English, the Yiddish language is a mixture of many tongues. Its main influences are German and Hebrew, fused with elements of Slavic and Aramaic vocabulary. If languages were dogs, Yiddish would be an adorable mutt. It's written using Hebrew characters and pronounced with German inflection, and the language has brought many well-loved words to English. In this slide show we'll explore the wide world of Yiddish loanwords. By the end of this slide show you'll be a Yiddish maven!|

In common usage, a glitch is a malfunction in something, often a machine or in a block of code, but this tech jargon was on the lips of European grandmothers long before sparks flew from a keyboard. Glitch is likely derived from the Yiddish glitsh meaning "a slip," from German root glitschen. Astronaut John Glenn brought the word into popular usage in his 1962 book Into Orbit. "Another term we adopted to describe some of our problems was 'glitch,'" Glenn writes, "literally... spike or change in voltage."|

Meaning an expert or connoisseur, maven entered Yiddish via the Hebrew word mebhin meaning "one who understands." In the early 1950s maven entered popular English usage. A 1952 article in The New York Times Magazine used an early transliteration of this Yiddish term to complain about know-it-all customers: "The most trying type of all is the 'mayvin.'" The article then explains to readers unfamiliar with the word that this term "of Yiddish origin has entered the language."|

A spiel is a high-flown talk or speech, often given in the style of a sales pitch. The word can also be used in a verb sense, "to spiel" or to give such a speech. It is derived from the original Yiddish and German spielen meaning "to play." The term was on the way to its current definition in 1896 when spiel meant "to speak in a glib manner." But a 1870 source claims that at the time to spiel meant "to play circus music," which is related to the German word singspiel which literally means "a singing play."|

This spirited word came to English from Yiddish in the 1890s meaning "audacity, nerve, gall, and courage bordering on arrogance." First transliterated as khutspe from the original Yiddish, our modern chutzpah was perhaps best defined by humorist and Yiddish lexicographer Leo Rosten as "^*Bthat quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.^*N"|

This worldly word was introduced to English in the early 1900s from the Yiddish shmuesn meaning "to chat." Schmooze was used in a 1939 edition of The New Yorker discussing the social habits of New York's fashion elite: "But schmoozing in the garment district is more than just a lot of idle chatter. Schmoozing is a careful tradition, dear to the hearts of everyone in New York's most thickly populated business section."|

A tchotchke is an inexpensive souvenir, trinket, or ornament. The word entered the American vernacular in the late 1960s from the Yiddish tshatshke from similar terms in Slavic languages, including the Polish word meaning "knickknack," czaczko. Tchotchke also meant "pretty girl," but today this sense has largely fallen out of use in English.|

To plotz is to collapse or faint, as from surprise, excitement, or exhaustion. The word is derived from the Yiddish platsn meaning "to crack" or "split" from the Middle High German platzen meaning "to burst." Plotz gained popularity in America English in the 1940s. In Patricia Welles' 1967 book Babyhip she writes, "You're not smoking that filthy thing in here. I'll plotz, Mrs. Green said."|

If you've ever stared on in confusion as musicians and performers talk about their level of schmaltz, wonder no more: they're talking about chicken fat. In the kitchen, schmaltz refers to fat or grease most commonly from a chicken and often used in soups. In Yiddish schmaltz means "melted fat," but in the 1930s the word took on the figurative meaning of an overly sentimental or overwrought performance. A 1935 issue of Vanity Fair described it as "a derogatory term used to describe straight jazz."|

And finally, we give you one of the most beloved Yiddish exclamations of all, oy! or oy vey! The term combines the Yiddish shout of dismay oy, with the German term meaning "woe," weh. Used mainly to express annoyance, oy vey! is the quintessential expression for that moment when you miss the train, spill red wine on your white table cloth, or simply can't hear another word from your mother-in-law.|

You can sometimes improve your chances by drawing some (but not all) of the defenders' trumps before playing for a ruff. On the present hand, this allowed you to cash three club tricks and then ruff the fourth round. The same play - drawing two rounds of trumps and leaving one or two trumps out - can also prevent a defender from over ruffing the dummy. |

You would have gone down if clubs were 4-2 and the person with 2 clubs had 3 or more trump. It is true that, with this line of play, sometimes you end up going down 2 when you might have only gone down 1 by simply playing for 3-3 clubs. |

Against Gothe's contract of 3NT, Wlodzimierz Ilnicki led the @C3, and partner Stefan Cabaj smoothly inserted the @CJ. When Gothe took the trick, the contract could no longer be made.

What's going on? Firstly, that's a VERY strong dummy facing a 4H opening bid. Secondly, what's happening in Clubs? The natural play is for declarer to cover the @CJ with dummy's @CQ. Why has he not done this? What is your defensive plan?|

It looks as though you are on the right track. You rightly smelled a rat at trick one when declarer played a low club from the table. |

This play in diamonds suggests that declarer has the @DK and partner has the @DA.|pc|d9d2|
