^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 1 of a minor, if you have an opening hand and 4-4 in the majors - my hand, you should strain to make a takeout double. Partner might bid 2@C and you only have a doubleton, but partner also strains to bid a major and often only bids 2@C with 5 clubs. Therefore, double is more likely to work out well for you than pass.|sb|s|mb|d|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have way more than 9 HCP in support of diamonds. Using Bergen hand evaluation, before the bidding starts you have 9 HCP, 1 length point, and 1 quality suit point for 11. Once partner opens 1@D, you can add 4 for the void.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can bid a Jordan 2N with 11+ or redouble with 10 points and over an overcall you can cue bid. All raises after a double, in both the majors and the minors are weak. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double raise to 3 just shows more length and distribution but still a weak hand. I would probably redouble with Jean's hand, but 2N is also acceptable.|
mb|r|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, let us discuss what 2@C and 1@S by Jean mean. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|2@C is definitely a weak bid, showing less than 10 and 6 clubs or a good 5 card suit. The way I play, which is not standard, is that any bid over the double other than redouble or 2N (which is a limi+ raise) denies 10 points. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, just to make things confusing, the way most people play is that 1 level bids are forcing. They can be made with less than 10 points, but there is no upper limit, but 2 level bids are weak.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you don't play the way I like to, then 2@C by Jean is weak. However, 1@S by Jean is not necessarily weak. I don't know about you, but I find that less than obvious.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now back to opening bid by East. East does not really have an opener, certainly not in 2nd seat. 11 HCP + 8 cards in 2 longest suits = 19 if using the rule of 20. So I would not open that hand. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am a big believer in the rule of 20. Flat 11 counts are not as good as they look. Flat hands in general are not as good as they look, but as I said we will let the bid stand, because it made for a very interesting auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good bid by Jean. Partner almost definitely has 4 diamonds at least on this auction.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if Laura thinks I have 4 hearts (and she should because I raised), then we have 9 hearts. Therefore by the law of total tricks (and my competitive bidding guidelines) she should bid 3@H. Granted he @DKJ are iffy and don't fit well with me.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ecolodge:  I did figure you for 4 hearts, Howard . . . and I know that the LOTT means I should bid 3.  I didn't know if there was a minimum pt count.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But LOTT has been a reliable guide for me.|

Govner:  What are my rules for doubling had North bid 3@H?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need good trump, which you have. You are saying you think you can beat 3@H. Given your partner has 10 points, it is likely that you can beat 3@H. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in IMPs I think it is too risky. It is possible we are down 2, but we also might make. In Match Points, I think it is a very good double, however.|

NT||up|37|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see what happens in 3@H for N/S. If not doubled, we probably lose 2 hearts, 2 clubs, and 1 diamond. But if doubled, we would place the @HJ with East and might only lose 1 heart trick (although the 4-0 break is tricky to handle). |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In any case the LOTT works as it usually does. And the double might actually help us make the contract. But double would be a reasonable bid, especially in Match Points.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ecolodge:  Question Howard.  With LOTT, does the responder need a minimum pt count? Should I have just bid 3@H over 1N to show 5 and a weak hand?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not really Laura. I mean you should not raise partner right away with less than 6. But once you show a min response, then LOTT is all that matters. HCP do not matter. Actually over the redouble, 3@H would show a weak hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because if I have an opener, East has an opener, and West has 10, you can't have much. But I probably only bid 2@H with your hand. Partner might not have 4 card heart support.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Govner:  When you say Match Points, is that the equivalent of teams rather than duplicate?|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|IMPs is what most play on BBO and what you play in teams. The size of your score matters in IMPs. So if you bid game or set the opponents a lot doubled, that is good. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But Match Points is what you play at most live clubs and most live games. In Match Points, it just matters how many people you beat, not by how much. In IMPs if you are for example, +110 and everyone else is +100, you won't win many IMPs because you only beat everyone by 10 points. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in Match Points, you would get a 100% top score, because you beat everyone, even if only by 10.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When giving partner a ruff, you make a "suit preference" lead. That tells partner what to lead back after ruffing. The 2 remaining suits (besides trump and clubs) are hearts and diamonds. So if Laura leads back a low club for me to ruff she wants a diamond back. If she wants me to lead a heart back (and she certainly does), she should lead a high club.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about light 3rd seat openers. The idea behind light 3rd seat is that after 2 passes, it is likely, if you have only 10 or 11 points, that 4th seat has a good hand. And you want to make it more difficult for 4th seat to bid.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally, I am a big fan of very frisky preempts in 3rd seat for that very reason (for example, opening a weak 2 with a 5-card suit and a singleton). But I am not a big fan of opening light at the 1-level, especially 1 of a minor. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you do that, then partner will never know whether or not you have a full opener. And when partner has close to an opener and a fit, he won't know how high to bid. So I don't open light at the 1 level.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a preference for better minor. If you play the style where, with 3-3 in the minors, you always open 1@C, then when you open 1@D you almost always have 4. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only time you have 3 diamonds is when you have exactly 4-4-3-2 distribution which is very rare. Having said that, if you want to play short club, that is not terrible. But what is very terrible is that if partner opens 1@C and you have less than 6, you SHOULD NOT BID even if you are short in clubs. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand the light opener worked out reasonably well. Another example of why you need not play Inverted Minors. I could bid 2@H to show a limit raise in diamonds, freeing 2@D to mean a weak raise. But I think I like 2@C slightly better on this hand. The point is you don't need 2@D to be inverted any more once there is competition.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hard hand to play. The spade play was reasonable. It works so long as East has 1 honor - 75% - that you lose 1 trick.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But let us look at the whole hand: and plan it out. I like to count winners. 3 spades likely for starters (4 if guess right), 2 hearts, 1 club, and 1 diamond. So only 7 tricks, you need 3 more. You should ruff 1 diamond at least. That gets you up to 8. If the diamond finesse works you are up to 9. And if you guess spades that gives you 10.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although this is far from obvious, I would win the @HA at trick 1 and lead a diamond. If the finesse wins I play the DA and ruff a diamond. Then I play the @SA and a low spade, I hope an honor pops up. But if West plays a low spade I guess whether to play the @SQ or @S10. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lots to talk about here. First of all, I think West has a clear 2@H opener in 3rd seat. As most of you know, I don't agree with the style that says a weak 2 cannot be made with an outside 4 card major. But even if you play that style, all bets are off in 3rd seat. Even those who play that style will preempt in 3rd seat with an outside 4 card major. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Preempting in 3rd seat is an extremely effective tactic. If west opens 2@H North bids 3@C and East should bid 3@H (LOTT). It goes pass-pass, and I probably pass with the North hand although 4@C would not be terrible.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@H they lose 1 diamond, 1 club, 1 heart and 2 spades for down 1. So on this hand, in IMPs they break even more or less (-100 vs -130). But given the auction it was fine, although I might bid 2@H over 1@D.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense, Jean needs to think, "Why did pard lead back a diamond instead of another suit?" Any of the other 3 suits seem like a better lead than a diamond. With a 5 card diamond suit, Jean should figure out that pard is looking for a diamond ruff. That only saves an overtrick, but it is still important to follow partner's lead on defense.|

Cast your mind back to the bidding. It is highly improbable that East intervened with a vulnerable bid of Spades on small cards only in the suit. Therefore he can be placed with the @SA. He may, of course, have both missing aces; but you can't count on that. More in the post-mortem comments.|

There are two immediate tricks in Clubs and one more in Hearts. Two Diamond and three Spade tricks can be promoted, making, with the Heart trick you have already, nine tricks in all. IS THE MAKING OF YOUR 9 TRICKS ENDANGERED IN ANY WAY?|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, for in setting up your Diamond and Spade tricks you have to let opponents get the lead twice. If they knock out your Heart stopper the first time they have the lead, the next time they get it they may be able to run off two or three Heart tricks. SO WHICH SUIT DO YOU TACKLE FIRST TO MINIMIZE THE DANGER?|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Cast your mind back to the bidding. It is highly improbable that East intervened with a vulnerable bid of Spades on small cards only in the suit. Therefore he can be placed with the @SA. He may, of course, have both missing aces; but you can't count on that. |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West may be treasuring the @DA as an entry for his Hearts. In case that should be so, you lead Diamonds to get the Ace out while you still stop Hearts. You lead a small Diamond towards dummy's King. If opponents refuse to take the first round of Diamonds, you play a second round, leading dummy's Knave. |
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To return to your own hand with the @CK in order to lead Diamonds towards dummy again would be a fatal mistake for two reasons. First, on getting in with the @DA, opponents could play Clubs. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Secondly, if opponents duck Diamonds twice and similarly wait to take the third round of Spades, there is no entry left to your own hand. Having made the two Diamond tricks you need, you switch to Spades. |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|A great defense by South. Next let us make a few comments.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West makes a take-out Double of your 1@H opening bid, East bids his Clubs. West then names a new suit. That shows a hand that was too large for a plain old overcall. East has enough to go to game.|
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Before we look at the defense, let's look at this hand from the declarer's point of view. He sees ONE Spade loser, TWO Hearts, and no others. He of course doesn't expect a 4-1 trump split, and sees no reason he won't make the hand.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One additional comment about his hand... you can see how he does need to pull trumps to avoid having us ruff in on his all-good minors, right? |
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sadly he won't see the bus that hits him till too late (that would be US!) We've clearly got two Heart tricks and the @SA. With a long side suit, we can knock the declarer's trumps out one at a time thusly taking advantage of our trump length. |
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Tricks 1 and 2 fall to our top Hearts. We continue the suit at trick 3. Now declarer only has four left, we think. When at trick 4, declarer pulls a round of trumps and Pard follows suit, we know we're on our way. Trick 5, declarer gets the bad news about the trump split, but he valiantly continues pulling. |
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We hatch our @SA like an egg, holding off until the third round of trumps. And now, the fatal blow: We knock out declarer's last trump by leading another Heart. Now declarer has zero trumps left and we have one. |
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It's just a matter now of waiting till we get in with our last trump and playing our final winning Heart. |
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is called a "forcing" or a "tapping" defense and as you see, works like a banana peel under the foot of the poor declarer. |

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|This is a great bargain. You give up a Diamond trick that you did not have to lose. In exchange, you get TWO black-suit losers away. Two-for-one is a great deal at your local supermarket. It's just as good when you're playing a vulnerable slam at the bridge table.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Comments: You bid boldly to a small slam in Hearts. Rightly or wrongly, West leads the @DK. You win with the @DA and see a potential loser in both Spades and Clubs. |
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One way to save a trick would be to find a 3-3 Club break. You could then establish the thirteenth club for a Spade discard. This relies on a lucky break. |
PG| ***** 272 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A better idea is to draw trumps and then lead the @DJ, discarding one of your black-suit losers. West is welcome to win the trick. Dummy's @D10 will then be established and you use it to ditch your other loser.|
PG| ***** 273 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This technique is known as a loser-on-loser play. You threw a low Spade (one loser) on the @DJ (another loser). So far it was a clean exchange of one trick for another. The gain came when the @D10 was established in the process. You could then discard your Club loser too.|

You have five fast tricks. Their diamonds are (most likely) dividing 5-4 and they can eventually take three diamond tricks. The safest suit to develop for two extra tricks is Spades, the suit in which you have INEVITABLE losers. |

PG| ***** 291 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have six fast tricks (including the first heart). Develop diamonds, not clubs. If you develop diamonds, the opponents can take four heart tricks plus the @DA. If the clubs finesse loses, you will lose not only four hearts and the @DA, but the @CQ as well. For shame!|

You have six fast tricks including your spade winner. West has five spades and East has four. The opponents can take three more spades, besides the ace, once they get in. Because their fast trick count trick is too great, you cannot afford to drive out the @DA. Instead, use your club entries to take repeated heart finesses.|

As long as you can establish your needed tricks (4) in suits in which you have inevitable losers (and they have inevitable winners) and the opponents do not have enough fast tricks to defeat you when they get in, DO the clubs first.|
PG| ***** 310 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Attack clubs (the longer combined suit in which you have inevitable losers), and then hearts. Between those two suits you can establish the four tricks you need without increasing their fast trick count. YOU DO NOT NEED DIAMOND TRICKS.|
