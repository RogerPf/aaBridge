The reason I say that is that Judy would have opened 1@H with a 5 card heart suit, so I know she has no more than 4. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |

And also on the 2nd heart, Faye led back her "remaining count" meaning she started with 4 hearts and had 3 left. So I am 99% sure I am making 3NT. The rest is easy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me talk about the bid by Mary. The 3@S by Faye, which is really very aggressive, put pressure on Mary and she decided to be conservative and bid 3N. However, conservative is a 2 way sword and does not always help. Probably a better bid here is 4@D or pass.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem on this hand is Judy probably needs 2 stoppers to make 3N because even if she has the @DA, with only 1 spade stopper you are taking 5 diamonds and a spade. Judy has to take 3 more tricks and you have no help for her outside of diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing Match Points, double is possible because down 1 doubled is probably a good score for you + 200 and if we happen to go down 2, +500 is a wonderful score.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see how we do in 3@S. We lose 1 spade, 2 hearts and 2 clubs. That is down 1 (-100) not doubled.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see how you do in 4@D. You lose 1 heart and 2 Diamonds at the most. As we see 3N was probably not your best call and being conservative was not necessarily correct. it was just a matter of what aggressive bid was best. I am not saying 3N was completely unreasonable. It might make but it was definitely chancy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the key thing was, that Faye's aggressive 3@S bid - based on Law of Total Tricks - was what caused all your problems. And I suspect if you had Faye's hand you might not bid 3@S. Anyway, this is a good illustration of why the Law of Total Tricks is a good guideline.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Faye tells me she bid 1@C so she can rebid 2@D - a reverse. However, you are not allowed to distort your distribution to reverse. If you open 1@C and rebid 2@D, that promises 5+ clubs and shorter diamonds.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, it is true, if you open 1@D and I bid 1@S especially (I will talk about 1H in a minute), you are not strong enough to jump shift to 3@C.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if it goes 1@D-P-1@S-P-2@C, Faye could have as much as 17 (as on this hand). But, I, as responder, have to keep that in mind and on this hand, that will cause a problem for me. Nevertheless, when you reverse, you must have the correct distribution, so you have to live with the fact that a non-jump rebid by opener is up to 17.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not my favorite bid, but I certainly can't pass. In fact one could make a case that I underbid. BTW, had it gone 1@C-P-1@H-P-?, now Faye's hand is a lot better and she might be justified in bidding 3@C because we have a potential heart fit, and her singleton spade could be an asset.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But when I bid 1@S, her singleton spade is a liability so she definitely is too weak to jump shift (which is game forcing).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss how Fay can decide what would be her best bid. She has 9 HCP, -1 for dubious @DQ (although with me bidding diamonds it is less dubious), and + 3 for singleton with 4 trump for 11 Bergen Dummy Points.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
My 1@D followed by 1@S bids promise 12-17 points. With 15-17 and a balanced had I would open 1N. With 18 I would jump shift instead of 1@S.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, although Faye has to account for the fact that I might have as much as 17, she should assume it is more likely I have 12-14 because that is what I have a majority of the time.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But on this hand, with 11, she wants me to bid 4 if I am close to the top of my range (e.g. good 15 to 17). So she should bid 3@S. This is why it is critical that you use Bergen hand evaluation to bid your hand.|

NT||cs|6|fp|1|ht|b|at|^-{ Word Fact: Fewer vs. Less 
From Dictionary.com }
^-|fp||aT|^B@2
Misuse of the terms ^*Bfewer^*N and ^*Bless^*N will set off alarms in the heads of many language enthusiasts. According to usage rules, fewer is only to be used when discussing countable things, while less is used for singular mass nouns. For example, you can have fewer ingredients, dollars, people, or puppies, but less salt, money, honesty, or love. If you can count it, go for fewer. If you can't, opt for less.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

However, it's not that simple. Since the reign of Alfred the Great, a time when Old English was spoken, less has been used in the same way that fewer is currently used. This long history of usage accounts for supermarkets posting the words "10 Items or Less" over the express lanes, when "10 Items or Fewer" is the grammatically correct option.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

If we know the intended meaning of the supermarket signs, does using fewer or less really matter? To many who have internalized the fewer or less distinction, the answer is yes. Using less where fewer is expected will sound jarring to their ears, so consider this as you count items or amounts in the future.|

From Dictionary.com }
^-|fp||ht|e|at|^B@2^*BWord Fact: ^*BAssure^*N, ^*BEnsure^*N, and ^*BInsure^*N: One of our readers recently inquired about the differences between assure, ensure, and insure. As with many words that share ancestors, these terms' meanings overlap thematically, but they are not necessarily interchangeable. Here's a look at the key differences.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


at|

Assure, ensure, and insure ultimately derive from the Latin word securus meaning "safe." ^*BAssure^*N was the first of the three to enter English with a reflexive sense of "to have confidence, trust, rely." Today, the term is most commonly used to mean "to state with confidence to" or "to cause to know surely," conveying the action of putting someone's mind at ease, as in She assured us that everything would turn out all right.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|

^*BEnsure^*N entered English shortly after assure with the meaning "to declare earnestly to; state with confidence to." Today it is widely used to convey the action of securing or guaranteeing an outcome or development, as in This letter will ensure you a hearing.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


AT|

^*BInsure^*N entered English as a variant of ensure. However, in the mid-1600s, insure picked up a financial sense of "to pay a sum to secure indemnity to or on, in case of loss, damage, or death." This financial sense is what distinguishes it today. Nowadays, we primarily use insure to talk about providing or obtaining insurance, as in After all his car accidents, the company refuses to insure him again. Insure can be used to talk about other kinds of risk, as in We insured against disappointment by making an early reservation, but note that in this usage the term is typically followed by the word against.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT|

As you can see, all of these terms address the action of making certain or guaranteeing, but each in a slightly different way. The most important distinction to remember when trying to decide which to use is that insure is the only of the three that explicitly refers to insurance policies and financial risk.|

On this contract you will make an overtrick if the two key suits break favorably. This is the moment when you should think hard how you can make the contract when one or both of those suits are not so accommodating.|

West's 2@H is a weak two-bid, showing a 6-card suit and around 5-9 points. Nowadays, players tend to open 1H when they hold 10 points and a fair 6-card major.|

Let us look at your options.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |

Here you are very happy that spades become trumps. You would have to respond 2@S even if you held just 1 or 2 points, so that would be a poorly judged response.|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


nt|^B@2
3@S would be much better, but that is a non-forcing bid and you could easily miss a good game if partner passed.|

mb|P5Sp|nt||lb|*bPlease make a bid. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^6S|nt|^B@2
When the opponents have bid a suit a raise of the trump suit to the five-level (when trumps are one of the majors) carries a special meaning. It denies a control in the opponents' suit and asks you to bid a slam if you hold one: Ace, King, singleton or void.|

Time to round up the wagons and assess the situation. In spades let us hope for no worse than 4-1 giving you one possible loser. There are two heart losers, none in diamonds and one in clubs. That is a total of four possible losers and you can afford only one. For now let us win the opening lead in hand and decide he next move.|

That is a no brainer. West announced six hearts and you see six hearts between you and the dummy. Let us go to the next quiz.|

NT||lb|*mWhich opponent most likely may have 4-card spades if there is a 4-1?^East~West~I have no clue^1|nt|^B@2
From the bidding and the fact that East has been silent throughout most likely he has the 4 spades if there would be such a break. But don't bet the farm on it. We will see soon.|

So it would be fair to play two round of trumps. But,|
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


NT||lb|*yDo you start trumps from your hand? ^^Y|nT|^B@2
Of course. With the lay of spades a low to Ace and then back to your hand is the best technique to guard against 4-1 break. Let us proceed.|
