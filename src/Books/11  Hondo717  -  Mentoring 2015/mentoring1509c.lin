^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying dbl is wrong, but what were you planning to do if I bid 1@S? Double not only shows opening points but usually shows support for all the unbid suits. So if the auction goes 1@C-dbl-p-1@S-p-2@D, what do you think that shows? |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is called a "double and correct" and shows a 16+ point hand with 6 nice diamonds. You cannot make a takeout double only to show points regardless of your distribution. Don't forget a takeout double also promises shape -- support for all 3 other suits, especially the unbid majors.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With this hand you can make a case for double and correct, although you are a tad weak and need another card in spades. Your double works great only if I have hearts. Further, you can overcall with 8+ points at the 1-level. You also can overcall with stronger hands up to 16 points even a little more. On this hand I think double and correct is acceptable and so is bidding 1@D.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


sk|e|mb|1S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play that 1@S by East shows less than 10 points and is not forcing over a takeout double. However, the standard way that most players play is that 1@S is forcing and unlimited (although often less than 10 points). Regardless, that is a very reasonable bid by Jean. Her other choice is 3@C. On the other hand, with her very nice spades I like 2@S better and it is 1 level lower.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, Sue did not raise you so at best you have an 8 card fit, and most likely a 7-card fit since sometimes she would raise you with 3-card support on this auction.|

scubagirl0:  Do I know yet her points?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S did not absolutely promise 5 but it tends to show 5. remember ostensibly Judy is showing spades with her double. If you play the way I play, she has less than 10 points because she did not redouble after the double.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you don't play my way, she could have a bit more. 2@S is certainly not forcing and in fact it is to play because you bid 1NT and limited your hand. So it doesn't really matter how many points she has. Jean has just said she wants to play 2@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am a believer in using the rule of 20 in all seats. So I would not open the East hand. But lots of people would. However, this hand is a good example of how it often gets you in trouble.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Judy has 11 points, close to an opener. From her perspective 3N could easily be making if pard has 14 or 15 points. But now she is in a 21 point difficult 2N contract. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opening light at the 1 level, although it may occasionally make it more difficult for 4th seat, often just confuses partner. BTW, this is a rare area where I do not agree with Marty Bergen. He thinks light 3rd seat openers are a very good idea.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see how we do in 4@S. We take 7 spades and a club trick for sure. So at worst we are down 2. Therefore, -500 vs -420 is not great but not horrible at IMPs. at Matchpoints it is not good. So at any other vulnerability 4@S is a good bid over 4@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's see what Judy should do over 3H. She has 12 Starting Points - 11 HCP -1 for @SJ + 2 length points. Once hearts are supported, she can add 2 for the singleton, 1 for the 4 card diamond suit, and 1 for the 6th heart now that they have a fit. That is 16 declarer points more than enough to bid 4@H. Therefore, they should get to 4@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done Judy. Bidding 3@S was fine although it gives Sue a tough problem. Judy's other choice is to make a negative double. Then Sue probably bids 3@D. An expert then would then bid 4@C with Judy's hand asking sue to pick her better major.|

Who knows? If diamonds break 3-3 then all you need to do is to play the king then ace of spades and proceed to discard a loser on a winning diamond (forcing the opponents ruff with their natural trump trick); a loser-on-loser play.|

If diamonds break 4-2, then you are still in with a chance depending on which defender has the doubleton.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: East on this hand was being very cheeky. Taking advantage of the third seat (where opening bids can be light and lead-directional), East opted to open his suit of A Q 10 9 rather than Q 10 8 5. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even cheekier is your partner, North, who raised your 1@S to 2@S with a doubleton! It's fair enough, though, because the doubleton support is chunky (@SA J) and a 1NT bid instead without a heart stopper is generally not advised. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over the 2@S raise, you could go slowly with an invitational bid but for some reason you decide to jump to game due to the lovely aces, the sixth trump, and the well-placed king of hearts. |

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Play: On the heart lead, you can see a club loser, two heart losers, and a potential spade loser. To reduce those four losers down to three, you can obviously guess the location of the @SQ (assuming spades break nicely). |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, you shouldn't put all of your eggs in the spade finesse basket - instead, test the diamonds.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Win the club switch at trick 2, play the ace then king of diamonds, and ruff a diamond with a middle spade (don't ruff low or else West might overruff with a small trump). |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If diamonds break 3-3 then all you need to do now is to play the king, then ace of spades and proceed to discard a loser on a winning diamond (forcing the opponents ruff with their natural trump trick), loser-on-loser play. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If diamonds break 4-2 with East having the diamond length, and the third diamond is overruffed by West (with the @SQ), then you still have a chance to discard a loser by using both of dummy's spades as entries for further diamond establishment. Say the diamond is overruffed and a heart comes back.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Win the @HK, cross to dummy with a spade, ruff a diamond (setting up dummy's fifth diamond) remembering to ruff it with another middle spade, and return to dummy with another spade. |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If all trumps are gone, you will then be able to discard your other loser safely on the diamond winner. In other words, you may not have to guess the location of the @SQ at all if you play on diamonds before spades!|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Did you notice something interesting? |
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


AT|

What if West NONCHALANTLY discards on the third diamond!? Then there would be a good chance that you will play East for the @SQ and go one down! |
