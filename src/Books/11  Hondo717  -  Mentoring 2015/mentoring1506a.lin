^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first discuss the bidding. Faye has no good bid over the double. I see her as having the following choices -- 1@S, 1N, or 2@H. None of them are great alternatives.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S, as a choice, should promise 4 spades. But with 3 to 2 honors, she has nice 3-card support. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 2nd choice is 1NT. She has the distribution and points to bid it. But she lacks a heart stopper.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 3rd choice is 2@H. That would ask Millie to bid NT with a heart stopper. Some people call it the Western Cue Bid. The probem with 2@H is if Millie has a weak hand (6-8), which she easily could have,  2N is awfully high.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is my first choice. That seems like the best compromise. But on this hand, with the 5-1 break, that works out really badly. 1N is my 2nd choice. 2@H is a distant 3rd choice.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as my lead, normally you lead Q from QJ with no higher honor. But on this hand I am guessing Faye has the @HK based on the 1N bid. So I want to knock the @HK out while Bonnie still has a heart. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Faye did have the @HK, she needs to take it. Otherwise when Bonnie gets in she will lead a heart and Faye will lose 5 heart tricks. That is why the @HQ is the best lead on this hand from my holding.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another bidding point. Over 1N Millie has a choice of 2N or 3N. I personally would probably bid 3N. She has 12 HCP. Granted her 4-3-3-3 distribution is a minus. But her intermediate cards (10s and 9s) are a plus. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on my theory that there is a lot of upside and not that much downside to stretching to bid 3N I would bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course on this hand, I would have been wrong both by bidding 1@S and by bidding 3N. Good thing Millie and Faye were playing E/W and I was not one of their partners :).|

up|40|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 3 choices here -- double, 3@S, and 3N. Double works if pard has a major but is bad if pard bids clubs.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S works if pard has 3+ reasonably good spades.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N describes my points and shows my diamond stopper, but we could be missing a major suit fit and I have a singleton. 3N seems like the best description in terms of points. Over double, pard could easily bid 4@C and we will miss game.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another alternative that one of the kibs suggested is 4@D. I hadn't thought of that. That ostensibly shows 5-5 in the majors. @SAKQx is close to a 5-card suit, so that would not be unreasonable but we might miss 3N.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2
tapanzee: Isn't 3NT risky with a singleton?|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All bids are risky. It depends on which risk you want to take. There is a saying called "Hamman's Law" which says "If you are at the 3 level and 3N is a reasonable bid, bid it."|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ladydoc: I thought, and we play it shows no singleton, and all suits controlled if possible.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It does but I have no better bid.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After my 3N, Bonnie should bid 4@D transfer here. As it turns out, we may have missed 6@H. Not sure we get there absent the preempt. One kib suggested I bid 4N since I know we likely have a 10 card fit. That is possible, but Bonnie needs the right hand. We could easily be losing a club and a spade. Although my hand is worth 18 HCP + 1 quality suit point + 1 length point + 3 for doubleton = 23 points.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Bonnie has 10 dummy points slam is possible. Therefore, although I don't think 4N is unreasonable, it is a bit risky. The questions are a) could we be going down in 5@H when 4@H makes?|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| and b) how likely is it that 6 is making and lots of pairs will bid it?|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My guess is that it would be hard for most pairs to bid it, so that is why I bid 4@H. My general philosophy is to go for averages and average plusses. the tops will take care of themselves and it is a bad idea to risk a bottom.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at what happens if Faye passes rather than bidding 3@D?|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT| Many players (very incorrectly IMO) would not open 3@D because their suit is not good enough. But hands with singletons and long suits have excellent distribution.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, if East passes, I open 1@S, Bonnie bids 1N I bid 3@H.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count Bonnie'sBergen Points in that case. She has 6 HCP, 2 length points, -1 for DJ = 7 starting points. Once we find a fit, she counts "declarer" points.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why "declarer points" when she will be dummy, because the hand with the long trump counts declarer points (even if they are not officially declarer). |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So Bonnie can add 2 for the singleton, 1 for the 4 clubs, and 1 for the 6th heart once a fit is found. That gets her up to 10, not enough to bid slam.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At that point, I probably just bid 4@H with her hand, although 4@D as a control bid would not be out of the question.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately 3N is down 1 when they take their 5 tricks off the top. But I still like the bidding. Note that 5@C is always down 1 (losing 2 diamonds and a spade).|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again proving when choosing between 5 of a minor and 3NT, 3NT is overwhelmingly the best choice on most hands.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And actually a kib pointed out I made a slight misbid although we end up in the same place. I should bid 2@S. That is not a reverse playing 2/1. Once pard makes a game forcing 2 level bid, opener just bids out their shape. 2@S would show 5 hearts and 4 spades and does not promise anything extra. But we still end up in 3N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I only have 1 club, that leaves 12 in the other 3 hands. That means on average Faye has to have 4. additionally the odds greatly favor her having more clubs because she opened 1@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you asked me to guess how many clubs she held on this auction, I would say 5 would be the most likely number which is why passing 1@C is right even though it did not work out on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The key to the defense was Faye playing the @CJ. Many players would not do that, fearing a ruff/sluff. But we have no tricks anywhere else since Bonnie's spades are set up. Next, let us talk about a different line of play.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie needs to set up spades to make the hand. Bonnie has 2 choices of how to play. She can either lead a heart to the ace and play a spade towards the 10. Even if that loses, she will take 4 spades, 4 hearts, 1 club ruff, and 1 club for 10 tricks. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is how I would play the hand because dummy's diamonds are protected and she can't lose 2 diamond tricks since if Faye leads a diamond, Bonnie has to win a diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Her other choice is to draw 3 rounds of trump and play Faye for the @SQ. I don't like that line as much because she could end up losing 2 diamonds, 1 club, and 1 spade.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the best way to play the hand is to play a spade to the 10. That loses, but Bonnie still ends up making 4.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Some of you might think that South's 2@S bid should be preemptive. But that makes no sense. You only preempt when you think they have the majority of points and you want to make it hard for them to find the best game contract. |
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|But in 4th seat, with a weak preemptive hand, South should simply pass. Letting the opponents play 1@C when you have a weak hand opposite a passing partner would not be a bad result. That is why the 2@S bid shows a 6+ card spade suit and at least an opener. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|It shows the same hand as if South opened 2@S in 4th seat after 3 passes. That is also not a preempt (for the same reason as discussed above). It shows 11-14 HCP or so and a nice 6-card spade suit.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding tells the story on this hand. West's opening bid promises at least 12+ points, and we've got 24. That doesn't leave a whole lot for East. This enters mightily into our planning. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We see three Heart losers, a possible Diamond and two possible Clubs. Honestly. We see two possible strategies: We have a Club finesse going toward the dummy, and a Diamond finesse toward our hand. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We reflect on the bidding. We should find the preponderance of honors in West, so it only makes sense to take the Club finesse. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We sit back and take our punishment on the first three tricks. We notice at tricks 1 and 2 East giving partner a high-low. At trick 3, East takes the lead and at trick 4, he plays the @DJ. |

NT|^B@2
Several Boot Campers thought they'd get an extra trick by trying the Diamond finesse, and of course it failed, giving them yet another loser.|

We need to play the @DA, and then pull our trumps, which only takes one round. |
PG| ***** 174 ***** |

Now we take what we hope is the winning play. We see the @CK as a sort-of marked finesse, and play our @CQ. It holds, so we continue the Clubs, and create another winner in dummy on which to dump the losing @DQ.|

^B@2^*BMM: It may be a good idea to read his comments on the bidding and play of the hand. We take you to the first bid.^*N|
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT||ub|23|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: You have a pretty strong hand so a 1@S opening is out of the question - you open a game-forcing 2@C.|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


mb|p2dp|NT|^B@2
There are many systems that deal with the responses to 2@C, but we will just employ something simple whereby a 2@D response is a "waiting bid".|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You now start to show your suits with 2@S and this gets raised to 3@S. Because you are in a game-forcing auction, a 3@S raise is a stronger raise than 4@S (a 4@S raise would mean a weak raise) and some might consider this as part of the "Fast Arrival Principle" whereby you bid game immediately if you have a weak hand and start slow with a strong hand.|mb|2sp3sp|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over 3@S, you should now start to cue-bid your controls. Generally it is not a good idea to ask for key cards (aces) when you have a void. The reason being is because sometimes you cannot be sure which ace partner has.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This hand is an exception however, because you have all of the key cards except the @DA so if your partner showed one keycard, you will be certain which one that is. |
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, because you are more interested to hear about the @HK and potentially a club control, you opt to cuebid with 4@C. |mb|4cp|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your partner will then co-operate with a 4@D cuebid,|mb|4dp|
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


AT| then you cuebid 4@H, then partner cue-bids 5@C (which you now know is a club singleton or void since you are looking at the @CA K), then you cue-bid 5@D.|mb|4hp5cp5dp|
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over your 5@D cue-bid, your partner does not have the @HK to cue-bid and bids 5@S. This was all of the information you need as you lack the @HK to bid a grand slam, so you settle for a small slam of 6@S. |mb|5sp6sppp|

NT|^B@2
Play: As declarer, based on your hand you might have two club losers and two to three heart losers. To deal with the potential club losers you can ruff two of your clubs in dummy.|
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your LHO has led a trump but you still have two more trumps in dummy to trump the losing clubs. |
PG| ***** 247 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What about the heart suit? You can discard a losing heart on the @DA, but you will still have @HA Q 8 in your hand. What should you do? |
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Right, you should take a finesse and hope your RHO has the @HK, or someone has a doubleton @HJ. It looks like you have a lot of work to do, so the key to this hand is all about the timing.|
PG| ***** 249 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Firstly, we win the opening lead in our hand. Next, we cash the @CA and ruff a small club. We do not want to cash the @CK just yet because we want to be able to ruff two clubs without needing to take the risk of being overruffed.|
PG| ***** 250 ***** |


NT|^B@2
An opponent might only hold three clubs and as a result, if we cash the @CK early then our fourth club may be (over)ruffed. After ruffing the club, the @DA is cashed to discard a heart and now a diamond is ruffed back to our hand.|
PG| ***** 251 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that we should not take the heart finesse to get back to our hand because of the danger that our LHO might win and exit with a trump which removes dummy's final trump.|
PG| ***** 252 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So we ruff a diamond, ruff another club, and NOW we can play a small heart from dummy and finesse with the @HQ. If it wins (like on this deal), we draw trumps and claim for twelve tricks.|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If the finesse loses, we win the switch, draw trumps and hope someone now has the bare @HJ (so the @HA will drop the @HJ setting up dummy's @H10). |
