^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A new suit here is forcing Joan. 3@D is reasonable and should be a slam try in diamonds and spades. There is some chance you have slam. If Millie likes diamonds she should control bid hearts or clubs. if she likes spades she bids 3@S.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand Millie should bid 3@S to show her 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, given Joan decided to bid 3@D trying for slam, you should bid 4@C as a control bid in clubs. In this case your singleton is 2nd round control.|mb|4C|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A kib: Some may play 4@C as Gerber which in this bidding I know is wrong. But, how could be avoided?|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One way to play is not to play Gerber at all, which is not a bad idea. But if you want to play Gerber, it should only be when you jump to 4@C over 1N or 2N. Here, they are in a spade auction, so 4@C is not Gerber.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@D would show a diamond control, 4@S would say you have a min hand and are not really interested in slam, and 4N would be RKCB.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@D by Millie shows a diamond control and slam interest. She could also bid 4N since she has both diamonds and hearts controlled. Joan has nothing more to say so she bids 4@S hoping Millie can go on.
With a double fit and 16 HCP I would bid 4N with Millie's hand, but pass would not be unreasonable either.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you get rid of your club loser on your heart, then 5 is guaranteed to make as you will only lose 2 diamonds at most. You did block the diamond suit because you did not play your high cards from the shorter hand first. But it did not matter here.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One good declarer technique is when one hand has a long suit, play the high cards from the hand with the shorter suit right away to avoid blocking the suit. Fortunately since diamonds are 3-2 Millie's failure to unblock did not hurt her, but if diamonds were 4-1 it might have.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie was very unlucky on this hand. She got a 4-1 spade break and the club finesse lost. The bidding and play were fine.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I having a very marginal opener was one of the problems and bonnie's 4-3-3-3 distribution is also not good. That is why our 26 HCP game did not make. It basically needds a 3-2 spade break plus a winning club finesse.|

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My bid, if any, is sometimes called a ^*Bfree bid^*N. Some people (incorrectly) play I should not, in this bidding postion, bid unless I have at least 9 or so. However, the best way to play is to say you are allowed to bid if you have something you want to communicate to pard (such as a long or strong suit).|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Otherwise you can pass. Passing does not mean you have less than 6. (although it does mean you have less than 10, because then you would redouble). On this hand I have nothing I want to say.|mb|p|

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is how many hearts should Millie bid? Here is the problem. Since Bonnie did not jump to 2@H, she has no more than 8 or a bad 9 and she could have 0 in theory (although in practice she almost never does). So what does 2@H vs 3@H by Millie say?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H says Bonnie should bid game with a hand close to a 7 or 8.

3@H says Bonnie should bid game with 4-6 or so. Since Millie has a flat 18 and does not want Bonnie to bid game withouth 7 or 8, 2@H is a very nice bid by Millie.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Millie is using losing trick count. I am not a big fan of losing trick count because I don't think it is nearly as accurate as Bergen hand evaluation. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a good example. A 7-loser hand is typically a minimum opening hand. But this hand is far from being a minimum opening hand. So to call it a 7 loser hand, although technically accurate, really undervalues the hand.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, Millie still made a very nice bid. Most players would incorrectly bid 3@H so regardless of why she decided to bid only 2@H, she made a good decision.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Furthe, this hand was a good illustration of why you should not hi-low with a doubleton when a ruff would take away a natural trump trick. Most players always high-low with a doubleton, and that is usually correct. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, when you have a trump trick that you would lose by ruffing, that is the one time you should not high-low with a doubleton. Watch what happens on this hand if I high-low.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand requires some careful planning. I likely have 2 diamond losers. Therefore, the trick is to limit my spade losers to 1. Based on the bidding Joan is much more likely than Bonnie to hold the @SQ. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if she does, I can limit my spade losers to 1 trick. Also notice I don't have a lot of entries to dummy. And I may or may not have a useful pitch on the @CA.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A diamond discard is not useful because I can ruff my 3rd diamond. A heart might be useful, but I can play Bonnie for no more than 2 hearts, meaning if hearts are 4-2 and Joan has Jxxx of hearts. I can finesse the @HJ.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because if I play the @S10 and Joan goes up with the SA, I need another entry to dummy to play another spade through Joan's queen. ^*BAll of this is a long winded way of explaining why I am "wasting" the @CK by playing the @CA on the first trick.^*N I need 2 entries to dummy and I don't need the pitch.|pc|C3|pc|cK|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose you had a weaker hand where you wanted Bonnie to bid 4@S with 9 points or a good 8 point hand (e.g you had a game invitational hand and no slam interest). You would also bid 3@H as a game invite.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule for control bidding is as follows. If you are not in a game forcing auction, your first control bid has to be above 3 of your major. So on this hand you would bid 4@C as a control bid because 3@H is not a control bid. It is a game invite. That is pretty subtle I must admit

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me first discuss why 6@S is inconsistent with your bidding. You asked for the @SQ. So unless you were planning on bidding 7@S if she had the @SQ and bidding 6S otherwise, there is no reason to ask for the @SQ. More likely it sounds like you decided you wanted to bid 6 regardless of whether or not Bonnie had the @SQ. In that case there was no reason to ask.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let me analyze whether your should bid 6 or not. Bonnie definitely does not have the @HK. She would have bid 4@H over 4@C if she did. So at best, you are missing the @SQ and the @HK which means that you have one potential loser for sure.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have 10 spades between the 2 hands. If spades are 2-1 you have no loser. Or even if Millie has 3 spades to the Q you can finesse her. The only time you have a spade loser is if I have Qxx. That is only a 11% chance. So it is unlikely you have a spade loser and 6@S is fine.|

They may have roamed the earth millions of years ago, but the word dinosaur has been with us for a relatively short period of time. In 1841, the British paleontologist Sir Richard Owen proposed the name Dinosauria, derived from Greek words deinos meaning "terrible; fearfully great" and saûros meaning "lizard," to refer to a suborder of extinct reptiles, some of which are the largest known land animals to ever inhabit our planet. In the 1950s, dinosaur picked up the figurative sense of "something that is anachronistically outmoded, or unable to adapt to change."|

[joo-ras-ik]  Audio pronounciation Link  ^*Ahttp://static.sfdict.com/staticrep/dictaudio/J01/J0119000.mp3^*N|CP||AT|
This term refers to a period of time 200 million to 146 million years ago marked by an abundance of dinosaurs as well as the first appearance of birds and mammals. It is one chapter of the Mesozoic era, which occurred between 252 and 66 million years ago and saw both the rise and extinction of dinosaurs. The Jurassic era gets its name from the Jura Mountains, which border France and Switzerland; the fossil-rich limestone formations of this mountain range were estimated to have taken shape in the aforementioned time period.|

One of the most recognizable dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous period, which followed the Jurassic period, is the triceratops. This distinguished beast is known for having a bony crest on the neck, a long horn over each eye, and a shorter horn on the nose. Its name comes from the Greek terms trikératos meaning "three horned" and ops meaning "face" or "eye."|

A brachiosaur would be easy to spot in a crowd thanks to its signature long neck. These massive dinosaurs (about 80 feet long) had nostrils above their eyes and long forelegs. Much like modern giraffes, the herbivorous brachiosaur used its height to reach vegetation in trees. Brachiosaurus comes from the Greek words brachion meaning "arm," in reference to its long front legs, and sauros meaning "lizard."^*N|

The tyrannosaur, specifically the Tyrannosaurus rex, is possibly the most famous of the dinosaurs. This large, carnivorous predator had relatively small forelimbs for a creature that could grow to lengths of 47 feet, leading paleontologists to believe that the tyrannosaur relied mainly on its speed and jaw strength to hunt. Tyrannosaurus rex is often translated as "the king of the tyrant lizards" from its Greek and Latin roots: tyrannos is Greek for "tyrant" and rex is Latin for "king."|

The stegosaur, which gets its name from the Greek stégos meaning "covering; roof," was an herbivore with horizontal spikes on its tail and a double row of large, bony plates on its back. This dinosaur, although it could grow to a length of 20 to 40 feet, had a brain the size of a walnut.|

The pterodactyl is one of the most well-known (and, thanks to the silent first letter of its name, most often misspelled) prehistoric creatures. Pterodactyl is the colloquial name for these flying reptiles, but it was first used for one specific pterosaur, Pterodactylus antiquus, and is not applicable to other pterosaurs. The so-called pterodactyl was not technically a dinosaur, although it lived among them during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. It had a short tail, a slender head and neck, a birdlike beak, and a wingspan of about 25 feet. These massive wings extended from its elongated fourth fingers, earning it a name that combines the ancient Greek pterón "wing" and dáktylos meaning "finger" or "toe."|

[ti-ran-uh-sawr, tahy-]  Audio pronounciation Link ^*A^*N|CP||AT|
The name of this dinosaur draws from the classical Latin velox meaning "swift" and raptor meaning "robber." Velociraptors used their long, curved claws to tear apart prey and their two hind legs for leaping and running. These carnivores were quick and relatively small (approximately six feet in length). Today, the term velociraptor is sometimes used to refer to a person who is vicious or otherwise predatory.|

The allosaur got its name from the Greek word állos meaning "other, different" because their vertebrae differed from those of other dinosaurs known when it was discovered. Allosaurs lived in North America during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, and were similar in form to tyrannosaurs but significantly smaller (adults were about 30 feet long).|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
This is a fairly standard looking auction. Hope you weren't tempted to Double 1@H - you only have two spades and having a two-card holding in an unbid major is a big no-no. |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Opening Lead: 
@C2 - Any lead could be right. A club lead has more chances for it to be safe - we just need to find partner with either the ace or the queen. This can be considered as an aggressive (or attacking) lead.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at| Play: 
When you win the @CK on the second trick, it is best to continue the aggression with the @SA followed by a small spade. It's too dangerous to switch to a diamond as declarer might easily have the @DQ.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It's also too dangerous to play another club in case declarer is out of clubs for it might provide a ruff-and-sluff.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
And a trump switch (a passive play) will unlikely benefit us - remember, we do need to find six defensive tricks after all to try and beat the contract.|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Therefore, it is better to exit with the @SA and a small spade. Switching to a small spade is reasonable play too but you might find yourself end-played later on in the play. Besides, there's a very small chance that partner might have the @HA to give you a spade ruff, so it is better to shorten yourself in spades.|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it so happens on this deal, declarer will win with the @SK and take a trump finesse. You win and you must now change to passivity and play back a trump. Switching to a diamond is still too dangerous as declarer might have the queen. |
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer at any point plays the @DQ from hand, make sure to cover that as quickly as possible!|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer has the @DJ after all then it doesn't matter what you play, but if partner has the @DJ then you better help out and set up the @DJ!|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand you had to analyze the defence very carefully throughout the play in order to maximize your chance in defeating the contract.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sometimes in a bridge hand this requires a full-on aggressive defensive, and sometimes being passive will do the trick. There are also times like on this deal where you needed to interchange between aggressive and passive defence. |
