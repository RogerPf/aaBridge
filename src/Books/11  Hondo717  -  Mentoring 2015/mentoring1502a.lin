As long as diamonds are not 4-0 you have no losers i diamonds. But the bidding should give us some concern. West must be short in hearts and long in spades and clubs. Further, East must be short in both black suits. Then it is important who has the @DJ. |

^B@2^*BMM: A few weeks back we had a roast but this week we have a toast. -:) ^*N Please review Howard's thought on his play next.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


up|32|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My first thought was I am glad I did not double 3@H which I considered. It looks like we only have 4 tricks at best (2 diamonds and 2 hearts). The reason I did not double is because, although I had a lot of trump, they were all low and with partner's diamond raise we are not taking very many diamond tricks. So we probably have to take at least 3 tricks in spades and clubs which does not look likely with my hand.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have to decide how to take 10 tricks in diamonds. I only have 1 trick outside of diamonds although I might be able to set up a 2nd club trick.  I might be able to score 9 diamonds (assuming they don't figure out to lead diamonds) by ruffing 4 hearts in dummy. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But this presupposes that East, who is long in hearts, also has the @DJ. If West has the @DJ he will be able to ruff one of my hearts with the @DJ and I will end up losing 2 spades, 1 cub, and the @DJ.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I started by leading a club so that I have club ruffs as entries to my hand to begin ruffing diamonds. Fortunately, the defense continues by cashing their spade winners, setting up my cross ruff. Once they try and cash a 2nd club, the cross ruff is set up, assuming East has the @DJ.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since luckily East has the @DJ, I end up taking my 10 tricks with the @HA, 4 heart ruffs in dummy, and 5 diamond tricks in my hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again a preempt makes it hard for you to decide what to do and lots of times you have to guess. One good principle to follow is that the shorter you are in the opponent's suit, the more you should want to play the hand (and vice versa). And a void is a short as I can be.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have losing 2 hearts and a diamond for sure. The important issue is not lose more than 1 diamond. I have to figure out who most likely has the @DJ.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The general principle you should always use is if one defender has more unknown cards than the other, then assume that defender has whatever card you need to find. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case Mary presumably has 8 clubs and hence only 5 unknown cards.Whereas Faye has 4 known cards (3 clubs and the @HK) and hence 9 unknown cards. Granted she very likely has the @HQ and some more hearts. But the point is I know 9 of Mary's cards and only don't know about 4. Whereas I know much less about what cards Faye has. So, when times come, I will play Faye for the @DJ.|

As you know I recommend leading the strongest and longest suit which is not bid by the opponents.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again aggressive bidding wins the day. Even on a club lead, it turns out we can only take the first 3 club tricks because of the way the suit is divided. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Judy chooses to lead a low club, so long as Faye plays low on the 2nd trick, the club suit is blocked and we only take 3 tricks. And if she leads the @CK (which is not the correct lead), we still only get 2 tricks.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With any other lead Faye has 9 top tricks. Also note that if Mary got conservative and only bid 2NT, Faye has a clear pass with just 3 queens. So unless Mary chooses the aggressive (but I think correct) bid of 3N they don't get to game.|

Alan Sontag was supposed to play with regular partner, David Berkowitz, in a regional last month in Florida. Due to illness, Sontie had to cancel and Larry got the call to replace him. He dug out his Berkowitz-Cohen convention card (their last session was 5 years ago) and tried not to embarrass himself. But, on this deal... |

"In 2009, I pretty much "retired" from playing bridge -- so that I could focus on teaching and writing. Other than an occasional date, I've stayed on the sidelines. If nothing else, I haven't had any embarrassing bridge deals for 5 years."|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |

"In December, 2014 the phone rang. David Berkowitz's regular partner (since 2009), Alan Sontag had to cancel out on a Florida Regional. Would I fill in? I had to cancel some golf dates as well as some lesson-planning and writing. Off to the Regional I went. Our team did well, but this deal proved quite embarrassing. With many kibitzers (maybe they thought it was their last chance to ever see me play --- and if there are many more deals like this one, they could be right), I held:"|

He opened 1@H|mb|1hp|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |

PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|
South has wasted club cards,|hc|CAKJ|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


AT| but still quite a good hand. Should South explore for slam?  A good idea is to picture a few possible hands for partner, such as:

@SA876 @HKQ42 @DQ762 @C3 or @SQ765 @HKJ42 @DAJ76 @C3. Opposite those hands, slam is great. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|
Even opposite an unsuitable hand such as: @SQ765 @HKQ42 @DKQ32 @C2, you'd still be okay on the 5-level. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|
So I would try for slam, and RKC seems the best tool (no need to make a control-bid).|mb|4np|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|
If partner has 2 key cards (either 2 aces or 1 ace and the @HK), you can bid the slam.|

After 4NT, partner answer 5NT.|mb|5np|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


AT| What on earth is that? There are many methods for showing a void after Blackwood, but in most methods, 5NT means 2 key cards and a void. This response should be used only if the Blackwooder will know where the void is. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|
Here, it is quite obvious that it is in clubs (partner's Splinter suit). So, partner has the required 2 key cards (the void isn't of much help), and you bid 6@H.|mb|6hppp|md|0,SQT64 H DKJ43 CT9876,SA8753 HKJT3 D9765 C,SJ9 HQ42 DAQT2 CQ432|

How should you play after the @C10 lead?|pc|ct|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|
If trumps are 2-1, you will be able to draw trump and claim--probably making an overtrick by setting up the spades to discard your singleton diamond.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|
But, what if trumps are 3-0? If you knew who had the 3 and who had the 0, you would start with the ace or king accordingly.|

NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: I am a bridge challenged player and should be reminded that Declarer has a sure diamond loser and cannot afford losing another trick to @HQ.^*N|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|
Without knowing, how should you start trumps?|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|
There is no clue from the bidding, but there is a subtle reason to start with the @HA. Can you see why?|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


pc|d5cqca|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


pc|ha|NT|
If everyone follows, it won't matter either way. |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|
If RHO shows out on the @HA, you will have a marked finesse for West's @HQ42.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|
But, even if LHO shows out, you still have a chance. If spades are 3-3, you will be fine (play the top spades, ruff the 3rd round and then throw a diamond on the 4th round as the opponents get their @HQ). |
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|
But, the extra chance comes if spades are 4-2. If you lay down the @HA and find RHO with @HQxx and also only a doubleton spade, you are still going to make your contract. |
pc|c6h3h2|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |

and play the 5th spade (now good) to throw your diamond loser regardless what East plays.|

Why won't this work if you start with the @HK? Because if LHO has @HQxx, you can't benefit from 4-2 spades the wrong way.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|
You have to ruff the 3rd spade and LHO will overruff and cash a diamond winner.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|
Summary: If spades are 3-3, any play in hearts will work. |
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|
But, if spades are 4-2 with the person holding 2 spades also holding @HQxx, you can still make the hand if RHO has @HQxx, but not if LHO has that holding.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|
Accordingly, the correct play is to win the @CJ (throwing a diamond from dummy) and to play the @HA next. |
PG| ***** 218 ***** |

You make on any 2-1 hearts or if West has 3 hearts or if West has 0 hearts and spades behave.|

ht|d|AT|For Intermediate players, "Reversing" is possibly the least-understood area of the game. The topic is so confusing that I sometimes hear people ask: "Do you play reverses?" or "Should I play reverses?" This isn't something which is optional. It is part of the bidding, like it or not.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


AT|

After opening 1 of a suit, we have to examine the situation where the opener's rebid is on the 2-level (or higher) in a higher ranking suit. Here are some examples:|

ht|d|AT|Reversing typically shows 4 cards in the suit reversed into and at least 5 cards in the suit opened. As stated above, it shows a very good hand. With a so-so hand (such a 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 points), opener must not reverse! He has to find some other rebid. In the following quiz, you can test yourself.|
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


AT|

Note: I do not recommend getting involved with this issue after a 2-level response. I want everyone to play that a 2-level response is natural and Game-Forcing. After this, opener can "reverse" without promising extras. So, 1H-Pass-2C-Pass-2S while a "reverse," should not guarantee (though it may contain) extras.|

Bid 1NT - Usually, this rebid would show a balanced hand. This hand isn't perfectly "balanced," but close enough. This is a much better description than repeating a 5-card suit. Opener should not reverse (2@H) with his minimum.

Bid 2@H - Raising responder usually shows 4-card support. Here, the 3-card raise is the least-bad option. Rebidding 1NT with a singleton is out of the question. Repeating the 5-card club suit is not a good idea. Reversing to 2@D with a minimum is unacceptable. Note: Some players might open 1@D (yes, the shorter suit), to avoid potential rebid problems. That way, if responder bids the dreaded 1@S, opener could rebid 2@C without reversing.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If playing 1NT forcing, bid 2@C. This is a known problem with forcing NT (opener being 4-5-2-2 with a minimum opener and partner responds a 1N forcing over 1@H). 2@C is the accepted solution. In real life, this problem will occur once every 6 months so it is not worth worrying about. Most of the time partner will pull 2C (often to 2S) and you will end up in a perfectly reasonable contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, despite the fact that 2 of my favorite experts, Larry Cohen and Marty Bergen, strongly recommend you play 1NT semi-forcing, I do not agree (very rare for me to disagree with them). I have tried it and found there are more hands where 1NT forcing works out best. Examples include when responder has a 3-card limit raise or a 6-card suit of their own. 1NT semi-forcing ends up in your playing a very inferior 1NT contract rather than getting you to a better contract.|

Bid 1NT - I "never" rebid 1NT with a singleton, but never say never. Here, you have to tell some lie, and I think this one is the least bad. At least the singleton is an honor (and in partner's suit, so likely we have them stopped). The alternative of repeating the 5-card suit is worse. Reversing with a minimum is a definite no-no.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I don't like rebidding 1NT with a singleton in partner's suit, I am not as averse to it as Larry Cohen is. I choose it when it is the "least imperfect" of all imperfect choices.|

Bid 2@H - Finally, a reverse! You have enough strength, and the correct shape. A reverse typically shows 4 cards in the suit you reverse into and at least 5 cards in the first suit. While 3@C would show a good hand, 2@H accomplishes the same thing and is much more accurate.

qx|A7|cs|6|fp|2|ht|b|at|^-{     Persian Letters (Letter 7 - Fatme to Usbek, in Erzeron)     }
^-|fp||ht|c|va|4|AT|^*B^B@2MM^*N: "Letter 7" is from ^*BPersian Letters^*N (French: Lettres persanes) a literary work, written in 1721, by ^*BCharles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu^*N, - a French lawyer, man of letters, and political philosopher who lived during the Age of Enlightenment - recounting the experiences of two Persian (Iranian) noblemen, Usbek and Rica.

"Usbek and Rica, arrive in Paris just before the death of Louis XIV and in time to witness the hedonism and financial crash of the Regency. In their letters home they report on visits to the theatre and scientific societies, and observe the manners and flirtations of polite society, the structures of power and the hypocrisy of religion. Irony and bitter satire mark their comparison of East and West and their quest for understanding. Unsettling news from Persia concerning the female world of the harem intrudes on their new identities and provides a suspenseful plot of erotic jealousy and passion." 

Montesquieu considered as one of the great political thinkers of the modern world. His views on the nature of states and their constitutions had a tangible impact on the world around him. In Russia, Catherine the Great drew on his writing in her legislative reforms of the 1760s, and in America the Founding Fathers looked to his great ^*BSpirit of the Laws (De l'esprit des lois, 1748)^*N in framing our constitution for the new republic.

In Persian Letters, in 1711, Usbek leaves behind five wives (Zashi, Zephis, Fatme, Zelis, and Roxane) in the care of a number of black eunuchs. Over time, various disorders surface back in the seraglio, and, beginning in 1717 (Letter 139 [147]), the situation there rapidly unravels. Usbek orders his head eunuch to crack down, but his message does not arrive in time, and a revolt brings about the death of his wives, including the vengeful suicide of his favorite, Roxane, and, it appears, most of the eunuchs.

I present letter 7 to show that a woman by expressing her love and desire, even in year of 1711 and from Isfahan can put passionate fire in the heart of any man. Alas, that is only fiction and the words are by the master himself. Fatme who lived in 1711 in Isfahan probably could not write.

If interested please check |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Letters^*N|CP||AT| for more information. To my knowledge there are several English Translations. One is by JOHN DAVIDSON. LONDON, September, 1891. You can read this version free at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bartleby.com/167/1000.html^*N|CP||AT|. The newer one, my source, by Margaret Mauldon Oxford University Press 2008 is available for cheap from Amazon |CP|1|AT|^*Htinyurl.com/pzr8p5q^*N|CP||AT|.|

Fatme to Usbek, in Erzeron

Two months have passed since you left, dear Usbek, and I, in my dejection, still cannot quite believe it. I hurry through the seraglio as if you were still here; even then I cannot accept the truth; what is to become of a woman who loves you, who was used to holding you in her arms, whose sole occupation was to discover ways to prove her love? A free woman by her high birth, but a slave to the violence of her passion. |

When I married you, my eyes had not yet seen the face of a man; you are still the only one whose features I have been permitted to look upon, for I don't regard as men those hideous eunuchs, whose least significant defect is that they are not men. When I compare the beauty of your face with the ugliness of theirs, I cannot but think myself happy; my imagination is unable to conceive anything more beautiful than the alluring charms of your person.|

I swear to you, Usbek, that were I permitted to leave this place where I am kept imprisoned by the laws of my condition; were I able to escape the guards surrounding me and choose freely among the men living in this capital of nations - Usbek, I swear to you that I would choose no one but you; there can be no one but you in this world who deserves to be loved. |

Do not imagine that your absence has made me careless of a beauty you treasure; although I can be seen by no one, and the ornaments with which I adorn myself can give you no pleasure, I still try to maintain the habit of pleasing: I never go to my bed without first perfuming myself with the most delicious essences: my memory dwells on those happy times when you would come to my arms; a delightful, seductive dream shows me the dear object of my love; my imagination, lost in its desires, is lulled by hope: sometimes I think that, wearied by the vexations of travel, you will return to us; the night passes in dreams I dream between waking and sleeping; I seek you at my side, but you seem to be eluding me; soon my overpowering desire itself dispels these enchanting fancies and brings me to my senses: I find then that I am so aroused… |

^B@2You may not believe me, Usbek, but it is not possible to live like this; fire runs in my veins; why can I not describe to you what I feel so vividly! And how can I feel so vividly what I cannot describe to you! In those moments, Usbek, I would relinquish power over the entire world, in exchange for one of your kisses. How wretched is a woman, to feel such violent desires when she is denied the very person who alone can satisfy them; when, left alone with herself, without any distraction, she is forced to pass her life between continual sighs and the violence of awakened passion, and, far from being happy herself, she is not even granted the blessing of promoting the happiness of another; a useless ornament of a seraglio, guarded for the sake of honour, and not for the happiness of her husband. |

You men are so cruel! You are delighted for us to feel desires we cannot satisfy: you treat us as if we were insensible, yet you would be very angry were that actually the case; you believe that our long-suppressed desires will be aroused on seeing you; it's a difficult task to win someone's love, it's quicker to rely on our amorous susceptibility to obtain what you dare not hope to win by personal merit.|
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


AT| 

Goodbye, my dear Usbek, goodbye; you may be sure that I live only to adore you; my heart is full of you, and your absence, far from making me forget you, would inflame my passion, were it possible for it to become more violent.
