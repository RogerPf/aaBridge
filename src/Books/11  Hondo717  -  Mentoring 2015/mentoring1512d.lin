I am quite certain that if Margaret had been sitting East, she would have played the hand better. Why is that?|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although in theory it shouldn't matter which hand is declarer and which hand is dummy when you play the hand, psychologically it does matter to many players. I did an experiment a few years back where I gave my students a hand to play. Most of them got it right. Then a few months later I gave them the same hand to play except I arranged the bidding such that who was declarer and who was dummy was reversed.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And most of them got that same hand wrong. This hand was an example of that. Margaret needed to visualize that she wanted to set up dummy. 

For example, there was no reason to ruff diamonds. There generally is no reason to ruff in the long hand unless you need the entries. Let me reload the hand to show you how I would have played the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is true that if you are playing the suit yourself, you should play the honor from the short side first. However, there is also the matter of "2nd hand low". |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you think about it for a second, you will see that if you play a low diamond at trick 1, you are guaranteed to have 3 diamond winners regardless of who has the @DQ. Because either I will play the @DQ, setting up your @DJ, or I will play something lower than the @DQ and you will win your @DJ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is one of my least favorite auctions. Shirley certainly has her bid but you often end up in the wrong spot. I might have bid 2@D with her hand, as an inverted raise, it's  pretty close. Also, if you play 2/1 the way I do, 2@C is another possible bid because I play 2@C over 1@D is not a game force.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ladydoc: I play 2@D as an absolute game force.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can play 2@D as an absolute game force Shirley, but that is not standard and I try to play standard.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|
ladydoc: It is part of a system.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand, but we have to have that agreement and we don't. Anyway. although 1NT is acceptable, it is not the bid I would have made.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Play: I think Shirley took a reasonable line. The diamonds were very unfavorable, however. Another way to play the diamonds is to take 2 finesses against Ben. Say she leads the @D9 intending to duck if Ben plays low. Even if that loses to the @DJ, she can take another diamond finesse and will take 3 diamond tricks any time Ben has at least one honor which will happen 75% of the time. Half the time the honors will be split, and 25% of the time Ben will hold both honors.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted if Margaret had Ben's diamond honors then the play I suggested would lose 2 tricks. Playing the way Shirley played, when Margaret played a low diamond at the 2nd diamond trick, she would have to guess whether to put up the @DQ or @D9. Playing the diamonds the way I suggested eliminates any guessing, but she was still unlucky.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another thing to note was Ben's very nice heart play. That is an expert's trick. Whenever you see KJ on the table and you hold the Ace behind dummy as on this hand you should lead low. Declarer has to guess what to do and will often guess wrong when your partner holds the Q. And if declarer holds the Q your play does not matter. It is either a good deceptive play or it makes no difference at worst.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
nome: When it goes 1 minor-P and the responder has 6-9 HCP and no 4-card major but has 4 or 5 card minors, is there a rule of thumb when to bid 3 of the minor and when to bid 1N?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 5 cards in the minor I tend to jump to 3 (assuming you are playing inverted minors). With 4 cards in the minor and no 4-card major, as Shirley had, I sometimes have to jump to 3 also.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At times, with 4-cards in the minor, and no 4-card major, and 6-9 you have to bid 1NT which I don't like to do. However, over 1@C, if you are exactly 3-3-3-4 (e.g clubs is your only 4 card suit) if you have 6 or 7, many experts (including me when partner agrees) will bid 1@D with their 3 card suit just to avoid having to bid 1NT. That way they play 1C-P-1NT shows 8-10 which works out much better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: Obviously you can't open a weak 2 in clubs so if you want to preempt with a 6-card club suit you have to open 3@C. That 3@C is sometimes done with a 6-card suit. However, you need to have a good reason to open 3C with a 6-card suit. 3rd seat is always a good reason. 2nd seat is a negative against opening with a 6 card suit. In general, your 2nd seat preempts should be relatively disciplined.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nevertheless, you certainly should preempt in 2nd seat when you have the appropriate hand, but 2nd seat is the hand where the preempt is not as likely to work. The reason is because partner is more likely to have a good hand and a preempt may preempt partner rather than the opponents. Why is partner more likely to have a good hand? because 1st seat has passed, showing a relatively weak hand.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a weak hand, that means 3rd and 4th seats hold a majority of the points and since partner is 4th seat, he is more likely to have a good hand. So you need to be a bit more careful in 2nd seat. although, having said that I would still open 3@C in 2nd seat at this vul because I am not vul, I am short in the majors (making it likely that the opponents have a major suit fit).|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Preempting has a lot of upside going for it and despite the fact that, if I were Margaret I would be annoyed at partner for ruining my nice hand, the preempt still worked well.|

ladydoc: Would you bid with Ben's hand? I would have passed.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absolutely I would bid 3NT. If he passes, the opponents are likely to be stealing the hand. Bidding against preempts is a matter of playing the odds. You no longer have room to explore.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you have to make bids that are going to work out more often than not. Basically you are now playing the odds. And sometimes you are going to get burned. But you are going to get burned more often if you pass and play scared bridge. I love playing against timid opponents when I preempt.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's true, he only had 5 hearts, but you didn't know that Shirley. Again, you can play what you like, but you will be missing a lot of opportunities to preempt the opponents if you have such rigid requirements.  Apparently, you won't preempt on many hands where you could. The idea behind a preempt is not to be precise. It is to disrupt the opponents.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you don't take the opportunity to disrupt the opponents they will bid more accurately on many hands. When you preempt you are sacrificing some accuracy in your bidding hoping that the reward of disrupting the opponents is more likely to pay off. And that philosophy has proven itself out which is why preemptive bidding has gotten more and more popular over time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I guess Shirley scared Ben into not bidding :). My style is to play there is no gap between a weak 2 and a 1 bid. With a 6 card suit you either open a weak 2 or 1. You don't pass :),  But many would pass with Ben's hand thinking it is too strong for a weak 2 and not good enough to open 1@D.|

yleexotee:  Do you make any adjustments for having a void?|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, many people will not open a weak 2 if a) they have a void or b) they have an outside 4 card major. That is fine if you want to do that, The reasoning being, with an outside 4-card major you (but only very occasionally) might miss a major suit fit. And a void makes your hand too strong to preempt. However, I am definitely not one of those people.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I have a 6-card suit and 5-10 points I open a weak 2 or 1 if it meets the rule of 20 sometimes. With Ben's hand I open 1@D. He has 11 "adjusted HCP" (add 1 for the quality diamond suit) and 10 cards in the minors.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Partner has @H9 8 x x or @H9 8 x Nothing else makes any sense. It can't be from @H9 x as West would have four Hearts and would have rebid 2@H. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner is known to have four Spades on the bidding and can't lead that suit - a passive Heart must look best to him. Which is more likely, do you think? A three-card or a four-card holding? What is the most promising defense?|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner might have a four-card Heart suit (in which case winning the @HK and leading back a Heart would be best defense) but the odds favor a three-card suit.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If that is the case you must duck the Heart - but signal encouragement at the same time.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Comments How to play: This time you are in third seat after East-West bid to 3NT by West. Your partner leads the @H9 and an odd-shaped dummy appears. Declarer thanks his partner and calls for the @HJ. How should you defend?|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The first step in accurate defending is to ^*BRead the Lead^*N. Here, West is unlikely to have four Hearts (think of the bidding – with 5-4 in the majors West would have rebid 2@H). So this Heart lead is not from @H9 ×. So partner has led the highest card from a poor suit, either @H9 8 × × or @H9 8 ×.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, if declarer has @HQ 10 alone it would be right to win the @HK and play one back but this is slightly against the odds. North is known to have four Spades and cannot lead one after this bidding. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner's most likely holding is a three-card Heart suit. If that is the case then it is essential to duck the opening lead (with the @H7, of course, to show encouragement).|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner gets on lead with the @CQ and leads another Heart and then gets on lead with the @CA to play his third Heart and you have three Hearts to cash. If you were to grab the @HK at trick one the contract would make easily.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is based on a real-life hand, dating back over 60 years. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Can you land 3N here?|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


AT| Well, to tell the truth, that's not the case. Sure, we have 28 points between us but that may not be enough. There is mutual shortage in Spades with the lead coming through the exposed @SQ and the combined @HA K Q J are only worth three tricks. Still, this is no time to neglect our Count and Plan. Well?|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|^*BSpades^*N: One top trick. Maybe the @SQ will be worth a second trick...? In your dreams, baby, in your dreams; |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|So there are seven top tricks with the possibility that the @SQ might be worth an extra (the opening lead would have to be from @SK J 10 x for that to be the case, though). |

up|20|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Again you arrive in the world's most popular contract (3NT) and West starts off by leading the @SJ. That's bad news for your side with mutual shortage in Spades and the @SQ unlikely to be worth much.|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You try the @SQ at trick one, of course, as players have been known to lead from @SK J 10 × but East dashes your hopes by covering with the King. So, having taken the @SA you are wide open in Spades and must run for home with the next eight tricks.|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Counting your tricks you can see seven: one Spade, three Hearts, one Diamond and two Clubs. There is no time to set up a long Diamond, even if Diamonds were 3-2; the opponents would run through you in Spades. Your only chance is to pick up four tricks in Clubs to up the winner count to nine. So, the crux of this hand is to play the Club suit for four tricks.|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We know by now that the right play in Clubs is to take the finesse rather than to lay down the @CA and @CK in the hope of catching a doubleton Queen. However, which way should we finesse? Through East or through West? It's a dilemma – or is one of the horns less sharp than the other?|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The possession of the @C8 gives you the correct play. Just as in previous deals in this set you should take into consideration the possibility of a 4-1 Club break. If West has @CQ 9 × × you simply cannot make four Club tricks. If you try to lead off the @CA and follow it with the @CJ West would cover with the @CQ and could not be prevented from taking a fourth round trick with the @C9. |
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You cannot make four tricks on this layout. So, to play West for the @CQ you'd need West to hold the @CQ and for Clubs to break 3-2. However… if East were to hold the @CQ you could pick the suit up for four tricks no matter how many Clubs East had.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Correct technique is to lead to the @CK (just in case the @CQ is singleton). Now comes the crucial card – the @C10. East has no counter play – if he ducks you run the Ten and have an easy route to four tricks. If, as happens here, East covers the @C10 with the @CQ you win the @CA and note the 4-1 break. This gives you a marked finesse in Clubs – so you cross to a top Heart and play a Club to the @C8.|
