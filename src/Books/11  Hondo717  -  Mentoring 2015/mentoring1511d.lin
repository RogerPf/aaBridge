^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For the purposes of teaching we will try Puppet Stayman here. It is not necessary to play Puppet Stayman over 2NT but it does have a small advantage in finding a 5-3 fit when opener has a 5-card major. Having said that, Ava and I have never played Puppet Stayman and we have never missed it.|mb|3C|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 3@C is still Stayman. but the responses are a bit different.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|if opener bids 3@H or 3@S that promises a 5 card suit. But if opener has one or two 4 card majors she bids 3@D - which is what she should bid on this hand playing Puppet Stayman.|mb|3D|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had a 4 card major, I would bid the other major. If I had hearts I would bid 3@S. If I had spades I would bid 3@H. This would allow partner to be declarer by bidding her major if we had a 4-4 fit. (This is similar in concept to Smolen, for those of you who play that).|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, say I had 4 spades. I would bid 3@H. Since partner has 4 spades she would bid 3@S and we would end up in 4@S. But on this hand, since all I was doing was looking for a 5-3 spade fit, I simply bid 3N since partner does not have 5 spades.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Puppet is somewhat complicated, so unless you want to bother to study it, I don't think it is a big deal if you just stick to regular Stayman. If you play Puppet, then 3@C is always puppet. if you don't then 3@C is regular Stayman.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed the bidding. On the play, let us start with trick 1. Susan should not play the @C8 from the dummy. Let's see why. She played the @C8 and Georges played the @CQ and she played the @CA. Now when she led the @C10, although normally you play 2nd hand low, Margaret now clearly should cover the @C10 with the @CJ. If she does, since Susan played the @C8, that would set up 2 club tricks for Margaret. Let me reload the board to illustrate.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Margaret cannot cash two club tricks. But Margaret did not cover so the @C8 play didn't matter. Had Susan played a low club at trick 1 she is guaranteed 3 club tricks the way the clubs are distributed. No big deal.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Other than that, the line she took was fine. Her other alternative was to try for 3 spade tricks, which she can win if Georges has the @SQ or the 10 falls. On this hand it turns out spades are very favorable and Susan can take 4 spade tricks. But hearts are also very favorable so she got an extra heart trick instead.|

Had Georges passed, then you could bid 3@S if you preferred. That would tell me to bid 4 with 8 or so. But once Georges bids 3@D your options are limited. 3@S is just competing to some degree.|

fazzzoola:  Howard, serious question about BBO:  Do you know if the hands BBO deals out are truly random?|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people feel that computer dealt hands, on BBO or in live bridge clubs, are "fixed" and they throw out hands. But that is not true. They are truly random. People feel they are more distributional. When you manually deal cards out by shuffling, most people don't shuffle the cards enough. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to shuffle the cards with good shuffling technique at least 6 or 7 times. So manually dealt hands tend to be much flatter than random hands because they are not truly random. They are actually flatter than random. That's why people think computer dealt hands are deliberately set up for wilder distributions because they are used to the less random manual deals. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in fact computer dealt hands are really random and manually dealt hands are not. Poor shuffling makes them flatter because each trick often contains 4 cards of the same suit in a row. Therefore if you dealt a hand without shuffling, everyone would get 1 card in that suit when there are 4 of the same suit in a row.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret should not bid 5@D, but Georges should using the LOTT with an 11 card fit. 5@D is down only 2, losing 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 club. Should we get to 6? Maybe. It is a very good contract but hard to bid it even without George's 5@D bid. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could be down more. Susan should probably opt to throw clubs and keep hearts. And Margaret might figure out, based on the auction, that Susan has a singleton or doubleton spade. How might Margaret figure that out?|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because Susan showed 5 hearts and at least 4 clubs giving her a possible one diamond and 3 spades. But she could also have 5 clubs meaning only 3 cards in diamonds and spades. Further, she did not show support for partner's spades.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So by cashing a 2nd spade Margaret can find out what is going on. And once she sees Susan is out, she can lead another spade for a ruff and hope that Susan has the heart ace and Margaret can get another ruff. But even if that is not the case, 3@D is down off the top, losing the first 5 tricks.|

PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets talk about what Susan might bid. 1@H is fine. Another choice would be unusual 2NT, showing 5/5 in the 2 lower unbid suit, hearts and clubs. Over 1@H Georges might consider bidding 3@D especially at this vulnerability. His hand is very weak and on this hand we happen to have only an 8 card fit,|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, most of the time (90+%) we will have a 9 card fit. He would like it better to be more distributional, with a singleton or void.Nevertheless, I still think 3@D is a reasonable choice. 3@D shows more diamonds than 2 diamonds in competition.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Could Georges bid only 2@D with his weak flat hand?|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


AT| Sure,but as you know I prefer the more aggressive preempts in general. It also turns out that East/West make 4 clubs, taking 5 clubs, 2 heart ruffs, 2 spades, and the @HK. But if Georges bids 3@D right away it is almost impossible for them to find 4@C. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, Vul vs not vul, 4 over 3 is rarely right and Margaret does not know that Susan has 5 clubs. And 4@C over 3@D is probably too high based on the law of total tricks. beating 3@D in IMPs is fine. A plus on a hand where there is no game is an ok result. Again, if it went 1@D-2NT-3@D, then 4@C by Margaret would be reasonable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Margaret. Once she gets the favorable spade lead and can count 9 tricks, she should be grateful to take 9 tricks. So the lesson on this hand is Susan should bid 2@D over 2@C. When you get a chance to make a relatively safe lead directing bid, you should do so. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, you might get doubled and go down 2 or 3. But more likely you will get partner to make the best lead. Opening leads are very hard. Susan knows that a diamond lead is best but that partner is very unlikely to lead a diamond without help from her.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Susan. Let's discuss the auction. 1@H was fine. I prefer that to 2N (Unusual NT) because Susan has 6 hearts and could easily want to play in 4@H. As to 2@S bid, normally most people play a weak jump shift shows a little weaker hand no more than 4 points. But some people do play it shows a weak 2 hand.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you have to decide which style you prefer. Obviously if you play very weak jump shifts, then Margaret has to bid 1@S, but if you play it shows a weak 2, then 2@S is fine. And 2@S did make it hard for East/West to bid.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had Margaret chosen 1@S I would bid 2@H with Georges hand and given her great distribution I hope Susan would bid 4@H. However, over 2@S, Georges has a tough choice. with 3 mediocre hearts, @SQ on offense, and only 4 HCP otherwise, I think pass was reasonable.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would be worried about not bidding 3@H but I would also be worried that partner might think I had a better hand. 3@D by West was a very nice bid. I still think Georges should bid only 3@H. 4@H is a reasonable contract, but they could end up losing 2 hearts, one diamond, and one spade. You should only bid 3 over 3 with a 9-card fit or a singleton in their suit.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding:  Your partner has a shown a pretty good hand by Doubling and bidding 3@d. We have most likely a double stopper in spades, the @HA as well as three card diamond support. Therefore you should co-operate with partner by not passing, but by bidding 3NT instead.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Usually the opponent's club bid can be as short as three cards (sometimes even two!) and when the opponents have announced their fit in spades, it is more important to have a spade stopper than a club stopper. Given that partner has a pretty good hand, it is likely that partner will have a club stopper for us anyway.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Overall we should trust partner's bidding more than the opponents'. Maybe your RHO has opened light, and maybe your LHO has responded light - whatever the case is, we should trust that partner has a good hand for his bidding. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Play: It might seem a bit odd as to why North (your RHO) played the @SQ rather than the @SA on the first trick. Your RHO wanted to keep an entry back to their partner's hand with the spades. By winning with the @SA and a spade return, you, declarer, will be able to hold up the spade suit as many times as you want. Why is this relevant, you might ask. Well imagine if your spade suit was K x x x (with no intermediate cards).|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Actually, imagine if your hand were @SK x x x @HA x x @Dx x x @CK x x  then if your RHO takes the first trick with the @SA and continues with a spade, you would duck twice to break communications with your LHO. |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you don't duck the spades twice, you might see yourself go one off when you take the @sK and then a losing diamond finesse to your RHO and your RHO will have a spade to play - but what if your RHO plays the @SQ? now it's too dangerous for you to duck as your LHO might actually have led from @SA J x x x! |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, on this hand you actually have a double spade stopper thanks to your intermediate cards so North's @SQ play was a good try but no cigar.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, a good defender would have reflected that South must have something outside the @SJ for his 1@S response (the @HA or the @CK) and might well have won the @SA and found the club switch. After all, you are really marked with a double spade stopper for your 3NT bid. Still, we can all do with opponents like this...|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the diamond finesse losing, but the defenders continuing with their misconceived plan, 3NT romps home with an overtrick.|
