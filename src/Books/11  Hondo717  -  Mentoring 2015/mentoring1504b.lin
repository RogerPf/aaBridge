|at|^b@2
^*BQuestion^*N: This just came up today so my question is what to bid when holding 6/6 in the majors and pard opens 1NT. 

^*BDear Sandy^*N: Even with very few HCP, 6-6 is a very powerful hand so you will want to at least be in game. Since partner can have at most 1 doubleton, you are guaranteed to have at least a 9-card fit in one of the majors. So you should use declarer addons when evaluating your hand.

To start with you have 4 length points, 2 points for the singleton, 4 points for the void. Plus you get to add 1 point for the 6th trump and one point for the 4-card side suit. That gives you 12 points without accounting for any of your HCP or quality suits.

If you want to be conservative, you can decide not to try for slam unless you have at least 8 HCP or so. But you could easily have slam with as little as 6 HCP.

If you decide you only want to be in game, bid 2@H (transfer to spades) and then jump to 4@H over the forced 2@S bid. That tells partner to pass 4@H or correct to 4@S - |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/survivalkit.htm^*N|CP||AT| 

If you decide you want to be in slam, the auction starts 1N-2@H-2@S-3@H, showing at least 5-5 in the majors and slam interest. Over 3@H partner should correct to 3@S with better spades. With better hearts partners makes a control bid in clubs (or diamonds if no club controls).

If partner corrects back to 3@S, then you can start control bidding to show slam interest. One problem is that you do have a void. So if you choose to bid RKCB, to be safe, you must assume one of partner's key cards is in your void (the way around that problem is too complicated to explain in a brief answer).

If you end up with 5 key cards, or 4 key cards and the trump Q, you can bid 6.|

^B@2^*BMM: North/South play 2/1.^*N|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 styles of 2 over 1. I strongly prefer what I will call the Bergen/Hardy approach, where if I bid 2@S it promises 6. As I think LOTT really helps hand evaluation (e.g. suit length is very important) this makes sense to me.  But Mike Lawrence plays that 2@S by me here is simply the "default" bid, meaning I have no other good bid.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer 2NT be the "default" bid meaning it does not necessarily promise stoppers in all suits, simply a hand with no other good bid. Regardless of which style you play, 2@S is the right bid. But playing Lawrence, Mary would not know if I had 6 spades or not. But playing my style, she knows for sure.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok Mary, now you have to think about what you are trying to accomplish here. What is the most likely contract after I bid 2@S?|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

msphola:  If you have 4 Diamonds, then we have a fit. I really don't like NT.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should make it easy on your partner. There are very few hands where 5 of a minor is better than 3NT. So Mary should bid 2N since she has both diamonds and clubs stopped.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I don't have a club stopper, so my only choice is to bid 4@D since I am assuming you are a) denying a club stopper or b) trying for a diamond slam. On this hand, however, 3N is much easier than 5@D, as it usually is.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|NT|^B@2
msphola:  but I am afraid that with our misfit, we might have difficulty navigating the hand. I bid 4@S then, as it seems everyone wants me to do it now -:).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count tricks. I probably have 6 spades. I have 1 club and 2 diamonds for sure. That is 9. If diamonds break 3-2 or the @D10 is singleton or East has 4 diamonds I have another diamond. Otherwise I need a heart.|

PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mary should anticipate that 3@D is going to give me a possible bidding problem and she should bid 2N to show her stoppers.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other point, when I play a diamond, based on the auction Faye should know that Judy is out of diamonds. Why?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because, I raised 3 diamonds to 4 diamonds so I have 4 diamonds, dummy has 4 diamonds, Faye has 4 diamonds, therefore, Judy has 1 diamond. At trick three after winning the it with @DA Fay should have played a diamond and given Judy a ruff - set -1. Experts always use the bidding as clues to defending properly. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And this is a very good example of using the bidding. Most less experienced players forget about the bidding once the play starts. But as both declarer and defender, the bidding often provides crucial information as to how to play or defend.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
msphola:  Howard, after my 3@D bid, could you have bid 3@H, since you have 2 and you know that I have 5?|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could have bid 3@H, but it sounded to me like you were possibly interested in a diamond slam. So I thought 4@D was more likely to work out better. Your 3@D pretty much denied a club control unless you were interested in slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice bidding and play by Faye and Mary. Faye was a tad aggressive here, but I like the bidding in general. Even though they only had 22 HCP, the 9 card fit allowed them to make 3. They weren't even particularly lucky other than the 2-2 break.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember a 9 card fit is often works an extra trick with the same number of HCP which is one of the reasons the LOTT works. Many players would pass Faye's hand with her mediocre spade suit, but I like her bid, especially at this vulnerability and it earned her a well deserved excellent result.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am actually glad Faye it did not occur to you to pass. She is buying into the notion that "bridge belongs to the aggressive bidders."|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After North's limit raise showing 10-12 dummy points with 4-card support. South should count their declarer points to see if they have enough to bid game. The starting points are 12 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point, and -1 for dubious @DJ for a total of 14 starting points. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once the fit is found South has the following declarer addons: 1 for the 2 doubletons, and 1 for the 6-card spade suit once a fit is found. That means South's hand is worth 16 points meaning that North/South have at least 26 points between them, enough to bid game.|mb|4S|

pg| ***** 82 ***** |


pc|C3|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead illustrates a key play for both declarer and defense. Since South is missing the @CK, @C10, and @C9, with correct defense South will lose 1 club trick regardless of who has the @CK. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Many declarers would go up with the @CQ, hoping that the opening leader had the @CK. But that does not really help. Even if the @CQ wins the trick, South will eventually have to lose a club trick. And if, as on this hand, East covers the @CQ with the @CK, South has a club loser. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But what South can do is hope for a misdefense. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |

He plays a low club from dummy hoping that East will play the @CK.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And in fact, that is what happens. Now South has no club loser. Note, however, East should have played the @C9. If South has the @C10 it does not matter which club East plays because, since the club king is onside, South always has no club losers if he holds the @C10.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |

However, as on this hand, if East plays he @C9, then South is forced to play the @CA and East's @CK will take a trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|South is still not out of the woods. He potentially could lose 2 spade tricks and 2 heart tricks if both the @SQ and the @HA are in the West hand. But South should hope that at least one of those cards is onside (a 75% chance). |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 18 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, and a known 8-card fit, West has a clear 4@S bid. Some Wests would bid 2NT but there is no point to that.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If you know where you want to go, just bid it. The 2NT bid will not provide any useful additional information to West. West will bid 4@S regardless of how East responds to 2N. So there is no purpose in bidding 2N first. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Many players bid 2NT in response to a weak 2 way too often. There are some hands, when you are not sure whether you should play at the 3-level, the 4-level, or in 3NT. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On those hands 2NT can be useful in helping responder make that decision. But on this hand, as on most hands, the 2@S bid is descriptive enough that responder can usually place the final contract with no additional information.|mb|4S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no obvious lead with the East hand. A spade is possible but risky. Leading away from a king can often end up giving away a trick unless you are leading a suit partner has bid.|

NT|^B@2
Sometimes it does work out well, but it is a high risk lead. Another possible lead which is probably safe is the @HA and another heart. |

NT|^B@2
A diamond is also a possible lead. You should avoid leading doubletons in general, but with the trump ace and no other good lead, you might end up getting a ruff. That is the lead I would have chosen. But the spade lead worked out just as well. The only suit East should not lead is a club.|pc|S3|

This Americanism is one of the most popular nicknames for money. The buck is thought to derive from buckskin, though buck can refer to a male deer, antelope, rabbit, hare, sheep, or goat. In the 1850s, the skin of deer was used by Native Americans and frontiersmen as a unit of exchange in transactions with merchants. We've come a long way from having to skin an animal to pay our bills, but in the vernacular the buck prances on.|

There are a whole host of words in American usage that refer to money by its color, from spinach to plain old green. But none of them ring with as much delightful weirdness as cabbage. The term refers specifically to paper money, likely harking back to the paper-like quality of the green vegetable's leaf. Cabbage as a verb can mean "to steal" or "to pilfer," likely originating from the Old French cabas for "theft." So please, think twice before you cabbage cabbage.|

Clams aren't simply bivalve mollusks that taste great in a light cream sauce. The word clam is slang for dollar bill. The usage is thought to originate from the various shells used as units of exchange in ancient times. In China, India, and Southeast Asia cowries were used as currency. Even into the 19th century, Native American tribes used various shells (including clamshells) as money.|

From the Latin word for "duke," the term ducat refers to a currency first issued by Roger II of Sicily, Duke of Apulia, in the 11th Century. The coinage spread throughout Europe in the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance when ducats played an important role in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Ducats have traveled from medieval Italy all the way to the malls of Beverly Hills. In the 1995 film ^*IClueless^*N, Cher Horowitz describes her teacher's meager wages using this term: "He earns minor ducats for a thankless job."|

Though it may seem that this term simply relates to the color of American money, greenback has more history to it than meets the eye. In the second year of the Civil War, the Union was racking up more debt than it could sustain, and the Demand Notes authorized by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase were not enough to pay the soldiers. So, on February 25, 1862, President Lincoln signed the first Legal Tender Act, printing $150,000,000 worth of paper currency using green ink, a unit that came to be known as "the greenback."|

Shekel is the only term on our list that is an actual form of currency used today. The shekel is the national currency of Israel, though it has also been used in English as a slang term for "cash" since the first half of the 19th century. The term was in use long before the shekel became the official currency in modern Israel in 1980. The word is derived from a Babylonian unit of weight, sheqel, which came to refer to a coin of this weight, minted in silver by the ancient Hebrews, bringing the shekel full circle in the Hebrew language.|

Commerce would be much more delicious if money were made of cheese, but for now we'll just have to sink our teeth into this piece of slang. Though the link is uncertain, ^*Bcheddar^*N, often pronounced chedda, is perhaps related to the cheese distributed to welfare recipients by the US government, referred to as "government cheese" in a short story by author Junot Diaz. The word cheddar comes from the village in Somersetshire, England, where the cheese was first made.|

Last but not least we give you ^*Bdough^*N, a monetary Americanism that's been with us since the 1850s. The term derives from ^*Idoughface^*N, a biting nickname given to Northern Democrats who worked for the South for financial gain preceding the Civil War. At the time ^*Idoughface^*N referred to "man who allows himself to be molded" as in Northerners who became the political puppets of the South. ^*BBut whatever you call it, it's important to remember that money is just a means to an end, and a dollar is only as good as the dough, cabbage, and cheddar it helps us enjoy.^*N|

It doesn't matter what you lead at this point, declarer has the rest - and says so.|

Let us claim play and proceed directly to the after-hand comments.|mc|9|

Bidding: A raise to the four-level (4@H here) is not based on points, but rather, based on distribution. You don't know whether 4@H is going to make or whether it's going to be a save against 4@S, but you certainly hope to buy the contract.|
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Most pairs have methods to show good hands with Heart support rather than shapely hands (cue-bidding the opponents' suit is common practice).|
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You would have bid 4@H without the 1S interference -  again, with a strong hand with four-card support you  should have alternative methods here to show that. (Many play a 2NT response as an unlimited raise in hearts).|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over West's 4@S bid, you should definitely compete to 5@H - you don't really want to defend 4@S, do you? |
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You would have made the same 4@H bid if two of your small diamonds were in clubs, so your hand is actually more offensive (as opposed to defensive) than a typical hand for a 4@H raise.|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Again, you don't know whether 5@H is going to make or if you're just taking a sacrifice (e.g.. if partner has:
@S x x @H A K x x x @D K Q x @C x x x
then 5@H makes!), so you take the push to 5@H. (5@H would go one off on this deal - but imagine if partner had a doubleton diamond ... then 5@H would make!) |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Opening Lead: Before making the 'automatic' heart lead, you should take a few seconds to think before leading. So, what do we know?|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We know that we can't be sure whether our side will have a heart trick or not. We have a big fit in hearts, and the opponents have a big fit in spades, so it should not surprise us if an opponent is void in hearts. |
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, you can see a trick - the @DA. We now need to find two more tricks, and an easy way to do that is to find partner with the @CA to give us a club ruff. So lead your singleton club.|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: After a club lead partner wins it with the @CA, and rather than returning back a club (which is what partner probably should have done - we probably would have led a heart instead if we had a doubleton club), partner cashes the HK.|
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Luckily, declarer follows suit to this trick. We can see a singleton heart in dummy and that partner's HK is winning (indicating that partner also has the HA). Does it matter what heart card we play? |
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well probably not. We have two tricks in the bag, and whichever minor suit partner switches to next we will have our third trick.|
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given that we know the contract is about to go down, why don't we plan for a second undertrick? We prefer that partner returns a club so we can ruff it and take the @DA for two down. |
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, we should play the @H2 as a suit preference signal for the lower of the two suits outside of hearts (and trumps) - which is clubs in this case.|
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On defense, when you or your partner leads/switches to dummy's singleton suit with the ace (or a winning king), it is best to play suit preference signals on this trick - you want to help partner to know which suit he next should switch to after winning that trick. |
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, partner obliges with a club switch in which you ruff, and then cash the @DA for two off. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |

^B@2^*BHoward schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I would be very disappointed, assuming they let us play there, if 4@H went down. You are a huge favorite to make. If partner has as little as the @HAK and a singleton diamond, you are making 4@H. So the statement that you don't "know" if 4@H is making, although technically true, is very pessimistic. And, in fact, although I would bid 4H, I would actually be a little worried about missing 6.|
