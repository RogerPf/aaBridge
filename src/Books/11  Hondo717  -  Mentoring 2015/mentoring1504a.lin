^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people play 1@C or 1@D - P -2N shows 11-12. So Judy is a tad strong for 1N. Her bid is 2N. The 4-3-3-3 is a detriment but the Q J 10 of spades is an asset.|mb|2N|

AT| and 1 for quality diamond suite. Bergen would say you should have opened 1N and I would agree. I discussed my philosophy for opening 1N using Bergen points a few weeks ago. It is a bit involved but I will explain again.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||ls|ed|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have the normal HCP (e.g 15-17) you open 1N. If your Bergen points are 1 higher than the bottom of the range (e.g.. 16 for a 15-17 bid, or 21 for a 2N 20-21 bid) then you also open 1N (or 2N).
In this case, since Faye's Bergen points are 16, 1 higher than 15 I also open 1NT.|sb|s|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, Bergen hand evaluation helped Faye to bid game. You always count Starting Points to begin with. And then once you find a fit either add dummy points if you are the hand with short turmp or declarer points if you are the hand with long trump.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The Bergen dummy/declarer points calculations assume that you are playing in the trump suit in which you found a fit. Therefore, if you choose to play in NT, the declarer and dummy point calculations do not apply. Those calculations assume there will be some trumping of short suits to generate extra tricks. Obviously in NT that does not happen.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mary if pard bids 1N, are you planning to bid 2@S?|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT|
msphola:  Yes. The hand has only 5 losers.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you think your hand is good enough to reverse. It is actually a much nicer hand than its HCP. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is the issue with 5-6 hands where the 5-card suit is higher ranking than the 6-card suit.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you feel your hand is strong enough to reverse then you can open the 6-card suit and bid the 5-card higher ranking suit.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you don't feel your hand your hand is good enough to reverse, you should bid the 5-card suit and treat it as 5-5.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, Mary's hand is deceptively stronger than it looks. It only has 9 HCP. But it has 3 length points (2 for hearts 1 for spades), 1 quality suit point, and the spade intermediates are nice. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It does evaluate to 13 Bergen Starting Points, but not enough for a reverse (you would need 17 to reverse). On the other hand, she has 5 losers.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is using the Klinger "losing trick count" hand evaluation technique. I don't think that is as accurate as Bergen but I do use it on occasion when I am not sure how good my hand really is. If you use LTC, you have 2 spade losers, 1 heart loser, and 2 diamond losers. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a 5 loser hand, which is the equivalent of around 17 points or so. Then, by that measure it is good enough to reverse. Personally I think it is not strong enough to reverse.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I am also troubled by the fact that if I open 1@S, I am bidding my much weaker suit and partner will sometimes incorrectly take a preference to spades when we should be in hearts.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So Mary, with this hand has 3 choices, all of which are flawed:|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
She can open 1@S, treating the as 5-5;
She can open 1@H, treating it as 6-5 intending to rebid 2@S as a reverse; or
She can treat it as 6-4 and bid 1@H followed by 2@H.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think I like the 3rd choice best. I would open 1@H and rebid 2@H. Nevertheless, any of the 3 alternatives could be right.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over a takeout double you prefer your major. And if no major then your best suit.|

msphola:  Should I have transferred to @S?.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mary certainly could pass but transfers are on, so 4@H is another possible call. With only 5 HCP they have at most 23 HCP and Mary's suit is good enough to play even opposite a small doubleton which is unlikely. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of the ace in a suit, as I am sure you know if you think about it, shows the King. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of aces and kings in NT are rare, and have special meaning on opening lead. Lead of ace is usually done from AKJxx or even AKQxxx and says pitch the K or Q if you have it, otherwise give count. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the lead if the king does come up more often. That asks partner to show attitude. High shows an honor, usually the Q or J or A. |

Bill Obitz, a Seaman at the time, recalled that the attacking plane approached at an extreme angle and estimated that it was 20 feet (6 m) above the water. Although struck by intense antiaircraft fire, the plane survived and struck the ship's starboard side at frame 169 below the main deck.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


ht|l|AT|^B@2While the impact of one of the plane's wings started a fire at 5-inch mount number 3, its 500-pound bomb did not detonate, so the damage was minimal. There were no American casualties, but the Japanese pilot died. Parts of the plane's wreckage and the top half of the pilot's body landed on board the Missouri. The plane's wing was turned over to the crew to be cut up for souvenirs.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|

Despite protests from some of his crew, Callaghan insisted that the young Japanese airman had done his job to the best of his ability, with honor, and deserved a military funeral. Ivan Dexter, a crew member, gave his account of events to Herb Fahr, recalling that the top half of the Japanese pilot's body was scattered over the deck, while the bottom half fell with the rest of the plane into the sea. What remained of the body was brought to sick bay for examination, and various Missouri crew took souvenirs from the clothing, including the helmet, scarf, and jacket. Following examination, the remains were placed in a canvas bag with dummy shell casings to weigh it down.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|

The following day, the Japanese pilot received a military funeral at sea. An improvised Japanese flag, sewn by one of the ship's bosun's mates, covered the bag holding the man's remains. The ship's chaplain committed the body to the sea and the six pallbearers let it slide overboard, accompanied by a volley of rifle fire. Fahr wrote, "There was still much bitterness on the part of many in the crew, but now, the honorable thing was done." |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |

According to Lee Collins, visitor operations director for the Battleship Missouri Memorial, Callaghan said that the ceremony was simply a tribute to "a fellow warrior who had displayed courage and devotion, and who had paid the ultimate sacrifice with his life, fighting for his country."|

Callaghan is perhaps best known for ordering, despite disagreement from some of his crew, that an honorable funeral be held for an enemy pilot who died during a suicide attack on the Missouri in 1945. Following World War II, he directed the US Navy's transportation service and filled senior command roles in eastern Asia, including leadership of the US Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force during the Korean War. He retired from the US Navy at the rank of Vice Admiral in 1957 and worked in civilian maritime transport before retiring to Maryland.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

Callaghan's decision on the Japanese pilot's funeral in 1945 would receive praise years later, although a memorial service aboard the Missouri in April 2001 attracted controversy. Leading up to the service, Callaghan's son said, "My father believed a burial at sea for the pilot was the right thing to do. He felt it would set a good example for the crew in showing respect for the life of people, even for the people you are opposing."|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|

Junko Kamata, a niece of one of the Japanese pilots killed in the April 1945 battle, said, "I want to thank Captain Callaghan for his humanitarian consideration for kamikaze soldiers." Minoru Shibuya, Japanese Consul General, called Callaghan's actions "a glorious deed, to salute the [pilot's] bravery."|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

Daniel Inouye, US Senator from Hawaii, reflected that "from the dawn of civilization, warriors respected their adversaries; it was an unspoken code of honor. When Callaghan saw the broken body of his sworn enemy lying upon his ship, he saw him not as an enemy, but simply as a man."|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

At a 1998 reunion of Missouri veterans, many of those present who had served during World War II felt that, on reflection, their captain had acted correctly. Robert Kihune, a retired US Navy Vice Admiral, said, "^*BIn wartime, courage is measured as much by one's actions as their strength of leadership during the heat of battle ... I think the leadership qualities showed by Captain Callaghan illustrate the ideal of what we want our military leaders to follow.^*N"|

NT|^B@2
What this means is that rather than banking on a guess of a finesse, we should try to see if there is a doubleton queen in a red suit by cashing the other top honor, and if the queen doesn't drop, we can finally then try a finesse in the other red suit.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So in which red suit should we try to drop a potential doubleton queen?|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We should try to drop a potential doubleton queen from the red suit where we have more cards (giving the opponents fewer cards in that suit).|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here we have eight diamonds between us and seven hearts between us. It is far more likely, therefore, that the @DQ drops in two rounds than the @HQ drops doubleton.|

PG| ***** 219 ***** |

PG| ***** 220 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Life is never that easy though, so if clubs break 4-2 you will have to bring home one of the red suits ... but which one? |
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|^B@2

PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After winning the @SA you should cash two top clubs in dummy. Before playing the third round of clubs you might as well try dummy's @HA to see if anyone has a singleton @HQ.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After that you try a third round of clubs and you then see that they break 4-2. |
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given that you have more combined number of cards in diamonds than hearts (eight diamonds versus seven hearts), you should try to drop a doubleton queen of diamonds. |

If a doubleton queen of diamonds does not arise, you can then revert back to the heart finesse.|

I cannot tell you whether it is right to win the club ace, unblock diamonds, then cross to the club king and pitch dummy's club on the diamond ace. Or whether it is right to follow the line chosen by the player at the table of winning the first club in order to lead a spade up. Both lines have merit and if clubs are 4-2 or 5-1 declarer's line looks at least as good. So let's live with it! |

Finesse or go up ace? Would your LHO have been able to duck the spade ace so smoothly? I have no idea -- I was spectating the event and thought that the duck was indeed possible. But declarer decided that his LHO didn't play the ace because she didn't have it. Reasonable enough --and as we shall see, right in practice too.|

PG| ***** 257 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is a strong argument for guessing your LHO has a singleton heart ace. Without it on a 5-2-3-3 eight count she might well not have overcalled on a bad suit when vulnerable. The extra distribution gives her a little more shape to justify her action.|

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|In the finals of the Gold Coast pairs Kelvin Ng found himself at the helm in 4H after he had opened one heart. Barbara Travis overcalled 1S and Choon Chou Loo jumped to 4H. Travis led a club and Ng won in hand and led a spade, guessing to put in the jack when Travis played low. |

Melbourne won his ace and returned the club queen to dummy's ace. Ng unblocked diamonds and cashed the @SK to pitch a club from hand, then ruffed a spade back to hand, on which Melbourne discarded his club, and declarer ruffed with the heart three, a play he would later regret. |

Now he cashed the @DA to discard dummy's club, and led out a high trump. Travis won in this ending|

She could lead her club to let Melbourne over-ruff, and exit with a diamond. Declarer had no choice but to ruff in hand, and was unable to overruff in dummy, and thus could no longer take the trump finesse.|

To make the contract Ng had needed to ruff the spade with @H7, leaving himself with the heart three at the critical moment.|

Alternatively, he could have won the club lead in dummy to cash the diamonds and play a second club at once, then pitch dummy's club and ruff a club. This leaves him playing for overtricks.|
