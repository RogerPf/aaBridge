Transcribing Howard's instructions for the first two boards took some time as the Movie Maker also is not good at transcribing. However, it was worth every minute of it. To show my love particularly for the second board I have additional information in the Movie Maker's Corner. It is very much based on the |cp|1|at|^*IUnusual vs Unusal - Unusual vs Michaels^*N|cp||at| chapter by Marty Bergen in his classic book |cp|1|at|^*IBetter Bidding with Bergen - Volume Two^*N|cp||at|. Howard, as usual, kindly has supervised making that part. The main topic covered in each board is outlined in the table of contents.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3D they lose 1 in each suit it looks like. We did slightly better than letting them play in 3D or it is almost a wash. They have 9-card diamond fit and we have 9-card spade fit.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the defense, a low diamond as opening lead was fine as Cheryl did not support diamond. Leading ten would show a doubleton. I would lead back the @DQ. For all practical purposes Cheryl could have the @DK. It would have cost nothing if she did not.  It turns out they will get the same number of tricks. But in other hands playing clubs could cost them dearly as they have set up the clubs.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|This is a very interesting board and very difficult to recreate the live event in a BBO movie presentation. Further, being a voice lesson did not help much either. Nonetheless, I did my best to make it as it happened and bring you Howard's teaching on several important topics.|

mb|p|nt||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^1C|mb|1C|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now should Toots open 1C or 1S. 6-5 hands are difficult to bid. If Toots felt she has a strong hand - which she does - she should open the 6-card suit and rebid the 5-card suit twice. The problem doing that is taking too much bidding room. However, if you make the @SK a smaller honor I probably would bid 1S first even though she is 6-5. That is more a case of style. So, I would not fault you if you open this hand 1S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H would have been my bid after a 1@H bid by Vered. However, now things would change as Vered asked for an undo which I will gladly grant :). Let us go back to after 1C bid by Toots.|

pg| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Vered decided to bid 2C which is a Michael's cue bid showing at least a 5-5 in majors. Now let us see what should I do with my hand.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


sk|S|NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid now?^^2s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 2C Michaels cue bid there is an interesting convention available to me called "Unusual over Unusual" which usually applies after an unusual 2N because the two suits are usually known. It also applies after a Michaels cuebid when the two suits are known. In this case 2C by Vered shows spades and hearts exactly. Therefore, I have two additional bids available to me - 2H and 2S cuebids.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I make a cuebid in the lower suit (heart here) that shows a good hand with clubs. And if I cuebid the higher suit - spades here - I am showing a strong hand with diamonds. In either case, It should be obvious to the partner that my bids are artificial as Vered is showing both suits in one bid. Therefore with my hand the correct bid is 2S - good hand with diamonds. Both bids are alertable. If I was not play the "Unusal over Unusual" convention I would bid 2D which is forcing and shows diamonds.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By cuebidding 2S I am not denying clubs. I can show the clubs later. Further, 2D or 3C bids by me in this auction would be weak and just competing. |

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double is an okay bid. However, Cheryl should bid 3H as her partner clearly is showing 5-5 in majors.  You know you have a 9-card fit. Again the LOTT always is your friend in competitive bidding. 3@H bid put a lot of pressure on Toots to bid. Even a 4H bid is not out of questions though it is a bit risky with only 5 HCPs. Further, It is Cheryl's duty to bid either 3H or even 4H as she is the one - not Vered - who knows they have a 9-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not lead @SA in this auction. I would chose @HK for the opening lead. The @DQ might have been a good lead as Cheryl was showing diamonds with her double. Regardless, avoid leading unprotected Aces.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, it seems that 5C is the best contract as it turns out. We just noticed one of those rare hands - because both hands are distributional - where 5 in minors is  better than 3NT. Assuming we get a heart lead in 3NT we take 6 clubs 1 heart and they take 1D, 4 or 5 hearts and a spade. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, 3H by E/W is only down 1 which would be a better board than we make 5C.  Even if they were doubled the had a better result. In real life that would not be allowed to happen.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mostly I want to discuss the bidding here. I agree with Boater opening 1S. But some would open 1NT with her hand. On the other hand with any balanced 15-17, you should open 1NT, even with a 5-card major. I think 1NT should be pretty precise, promising at most 1 doubleton, so 5-3-3-2 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 distribution. So I would open West 1S but many would open it 1N.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point is, when responder raises opener to 2, and it is about to be passed out such as on this hand you should be reluctant to let them simply play in 2. Once they find a fit, letting them play at the 2-level will normally be, at best, an average result for you. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It will virtually never be a good result and can easily be a bad result for you. Therefore, once they find a fit, you should be reluctant to let them play there. On the other hand because f unfavorable vulnerability and I did not make a bid, it is reasonable for Bonnie to pass. but, were I in her seat, I might also pass, but I would be very unhappy.|

^-|HT|f|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3B|FP||AT|ridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a tutorial on defense against the Two-Suited Overcalls - Unusual Notrump (UNT) and Michaels Cuebid. It is based on ^*IBetter Bidding with Bergen  -  Volume II^*N, SIXTH Printing - September, 1995 ISBN No. 0 - 910791 - 78 - 3R. 

Here I would like to ask Mr. Bergen's forgiveness for not asking his permission before using his material. But I have many excuses. Just to name a few, this section of his book in particular is the core - the only one - of almost all the material published on the web about the topic. Some even did not give the proper acknowledgement. And in the past Mr. Bergen has been very generous in granting me the use of his material.

One more item which I should mention before we begin. There is a word or two from our sponsor (mentor) at the end. Please make sure you read it.|

Although knowledge of conventions is helpful,

   one does not need to know all about those conventions which the partnership doesn't employ.   

However, it is crucial to have partnership understandings with respect to combating them.

^B@2The defense guideline against Unusual Notrump and Michaels Cuebids outlined by Marty Bergen probably is the easiest to learn. Therefore, this section - ^*BDefense Against Two-Suited Overcall Bids^*N - is is based mainly on Marty Bergen's ^*IBetter Bidding With Bergen Volume II^*N : |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||AT|. 

There are two parts to this section

^C1. Unusual vs. Unusual - Defending Against Unusual Notrump

^B@2
The defense against Unusual Notrump bids probably is the easiest because a jump overcall in Notrump by the opponents shows the two lower unbid suits. Because the two suits are known, therefore, there would be two new cuebids available for the Opener's partner. Let us go through a few exercises. In all we would be playing SAYC as the 2/1 is off after a jump overcall.|

On the other hand, based on the two suits implied by the overcaller two new options - cuebids - becomes available. In the case of 1S opening the two suits implied are clubs and diamonds. Thus, the responder (South) gains ^*Bthe 3C cuebid - the cheaper cuebid - and 3D cuebid or ##2 cuebid.^*N|

We can use this simple guideline after a jump overcall when the two suits implied are known. The responder loses a few of his tools but gains two cuebids - the cheaper = good raise of partner's suit; Cuebid ##2 = good hand in fourth suit. Let us try it after 1C opening.|

This is a good of example of the "or better" part of 3C showing a limit raise or better - even if partner signs off in 3S, you would bid 4S. Of course you may consider the Law of Total Tricks and bid 4S. There is only a small probability that you may miss slam in spades.|

ht|e|fp|2|at|^-2. Defending Against Michaels Cuebids
^-|FP||ht|i|AT|
^B@2The defense against Michaels cuebids are very similar to defending against UNT when both suits are known. However, there may be confusion when one of the two suits promised by the overcaller is unknown. The good news, however, is that Partner - in most instances - has to bid in 2 level - a lower level than when UNT is the overcall bid. |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


AT|

Let us look at the defense guideline when both implied suits by the overcaller is known such as in 1C-2C or 1D-2D - (hearts and spades). To illustrate we will use the same pattern as we did for explaining the defense against the UNT. Here again the freakish hands requiring freakish bids are not included.|

Method A - the lower cue bid shows the lower of the two remaining suits, the higher cue bid shows the higher of the two remaining suits. For example, over  both 1H-2N and 1S-2N, 3C shows hearts and 3D shows spades. 

Method B - the lower cue bid shows support for opener's suit and the higher cue bid shows the other remaining suit. For example, over 1H-2N, 3C shows hearts and 3D shows spades, but over 1S-2N, 3C shows spades and 3D shows hearts.

You and your partner must agree as to which method you use.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
