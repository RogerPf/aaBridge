^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand. It has been suggested I double and correct, and that is certainly reasonable with my hand. The reason I did not was more tactical than anything else. I was afraid there would be a diamond raise, and that means I would have to bid my suit at the 3 level if I doubled first. So I chose to show my spades rather than my points.|

Dianne0516: Howard, on a double and correct, is it forcing to game?|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, a double and correct is not forcing to game, but partner should strain to bid if at all possible. Here, Pam's hand is too weak to bid 4, even with 3 spades. But if she had as little as an ace with 3 or 4 spades, she should consider bidding 4. I am promising usually a six card suit, and at least 16 good points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss opening leads again. Some general guidelines:|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don't lead any suits the opponents have bid;|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don't lead unprotected aces;|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner bids a suit, unless you have an unprotected ace in it or are void, lead that suit;|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Honor sequences are the best leads. so, for example on the hand before this one, J from J109 tends to be a good lead;|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you only have small cards, no honors, you need to decide whether you lead count or attitude. The modern tendency is to lead attitude, so if Darlene decides to lead spades, she should lead a high spade to show no honors, the 8 in this case. However, some people still play count, in which case the 2 would be right. But, I recommend attitud. Generally speaking doubleton leads are not a good idea. Only lead them if there is no other good lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those of you unfamiliar with the 2C bid, that is artificial (although on this hand Eddy happens to have clubs). It is called 4th Suit Forcing (4SF). It establishes a game force, and says nothing about clubs. Eddy's next bid will clarify why he bid it. Since I don't have a club stopper, and Eddy is not guaranteeing clubs, I cannot bid 2N. I am also denying 3 hearts, as I would bid hearts if I had.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Eddy made a very nice bid here. We are in a game forcing auction, after 2C, so that means "fast arrival" is in play. Fast arrival works as follows:|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|
Once we are in a game forcing situation, the faster someone bids game, the weaker their hand is. The idea is, with stronger hands, you want to preserve room to explore for a slam. Eddy is showing at least 16 points or so by bidding 2N. With less than that he would use fast arrival and bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


mb|p|NT||SK|S|lb|*bChoose your bid please. ^^4n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I have 15 points it is certainly possible we have slam and I don't want to just bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |

veredk: Howard, did you limit your hand by rebidding 2@D?|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well I limited my hand to 17 by bidding 1S, non jump-shift. If I had 18 or more I would have bid 2S. My 2D bid simply shows 5 diamonds and 4 spades. 2C established game force so 2D is just shape. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Medium (15-17) hand opposite medium hand slams are the hardest to bid. This is one case where quantitative 4N might work well. If I bid 4N, I am saying I have 15 or 16, not quite enough to bid slam if Eddy has only 16 or so. However, by bidding 4N I am asking Eddy to bid on if he has enough to bid slam opposite a good 15.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try Eddy. As tcyk said, the diamonds are a pure guess. You basically need a 3-3 break, with the Queen onside, or doubleton @d Q 9. And it is a guess as to who has the @DQ. Playing the @dK first is maybe 1-2% better, in the rare instance of Vered having stiff Queen. But too small to really matter.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick three, Vered did make a big defensive error in not cashing her @HA. It turns out the club breaks up the squeeze, but Eddy almost had a squeeze on this hand, with one more entry to his hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first let me discuss the E/W auction, then Eddy's 2N. Most of you know, I would open West 2S. It is much more effective to preempt early than to come in later. I disagree with those who say you cannot bid a weak 2 with an outside 4 card major. A preempt is most effective the earlier you bid it.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT|^B@2
hope: I did not have a good preempt and do not preempt partner in first seat :(.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I still do, but I would understand if you chose not to bid it at unfavorable vulnerability. Here, let me discuss preempting theory.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In first seat, a preempt is odds on to work because if you have a weak hand, that leaves more points for the opponents. A preempt is even more appropriate in third seat since there are 2 passes, and you have a weak hand, it is almost certain that fourth seat has a good hand.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only time you should be a little more cautious with a preempt is second seat because then it is more likely that partner has a good hand and you will be preempting partner. If first seat passes, and you have a weak hand, that leaves more points for partner to have. So, if you are worried about preempting partner, only worry about it in second seat.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I never worry about it, lol. Remember, the earlier you preempt the more effective it is. The more chance you give the opponents to exchange information, the less effective a preempt is. ^*uOn the other hand, to be ACBL main stream you should follow the rule of two out of three or three out five honors.^*n|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


at| But my guess would be something like "1 of top 3 and 2 of top 5" is more main stream these days. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Those comments are from 2009. Now let me share with you what Eddie Kantar wrote in his June 2011 updated article on Weak Two Bids.|

AT| "Suit strength can vary with the vulnerability and seat. Ideally three or four of the top five honors will head the suit. Practically, two of the top five honors along with the 98 or 97 attached will do just fine, thank you. Suits that look like: AK10765, AK9732, KQ9732, AJ9843, QJ10432, KJ9765 are fine. In addition, at favorable vulnerability liberties are allowed, particularly in 3rd seat."|CP|1|AT|  ^*Hwww.kantarbridge.com/weak_2s.htm^*N|CP||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, let's take the auction as is. Should Vered bid 3S? First off Vered should have opened. But given she did not, she should not bid 3S. The law of total tricks is really a good tool and since they only have 8 trumps, the law says Vered should not bid 3S. It turns out we probably make 3 hearts in real life, although it can be beaten with a diamond ruff.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It doesn't matter Vered. If you can make 3S you are beating 3 hearts. The law is really very accurate on part score hands. I won't say it works perfectly on every hand, but it works way better than your judgement when you violate it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss the 2N bid. A few weeks ago I discussed a method for distinguishing between 3 card and 4 card limit raises in competition and, in fact, that is an important distinction. |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 9-card fit is often worth an extra trick vs an 8-card fit. Most people play a cue bid in competition shows a 3 card or 4 card limit. For example, 1H-1S-2S shows a limit raise, but only promises 3 card support. It would be nice if you could distinguish between a 3 card and 4 card raise. So some people play there are 2 ways to raise in competition - a cue bid and 2N.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The cheaper bid shows a 3 card limit raise, the higher bid a 4 card limit raise. For example, the auction 1H-1S-2N shows a 4 card limit raise, 1H-1S-2S a 3 card limit raise. On the other hand, the auction 1H-2C-2N shows a 3 card raise, 1H-2C-3C a 4 card raise.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand Eddy is stuck because 3S is a game force. So although it turns out he has a 3 card raise and the 3S is the expected bid, I would say, if you play 2N is a limit raise, in this auction 2N should show a limit raise in general, with 3 or 4 cards. I am saying the cue bid of 3S is not available to Eddy because that would force us to 4H. The raise is not a game force, only invitational.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more time let me explain the convention as it normally works. If you play this 2NT convention , you have 2 ways of showing a limit raise. One way is to cue bid the opponent's suit. The other is to bid 2NT. The cheaper of those bids shows a 3-card limit raise, the more expensive bid shows a 4-card limit raise. So, if the auction goes 1H-1S-?, 2S = 3-card limit raise, 2N = 4-card limit raise. If the auction goes 1H-2C-?, 2N = 3-card limit raise, 3C = 4-card limit raise. The purpose, of course, is to differentiate between a 3-card and 4-card limit raise, which is important for those of us who like the law of total tricks. If you do not play this, most people play that a cue bid in competition is a limit raise, but can be done with either 3-card or 4-card support. |

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have  the great news from Paul Thurston recent excellent lesson in BIL where the Movie Maker and Joyce bedazzled the audience.|

Paul Thurston is a Canadian National Champion who has represented Canada in world competitions as player and as the captain. He gave his first lesson in the BIL on February 9 and the next is scheduled on February 23, 2012. Karen, BBO nickname (karen10) is producing a BBO movie presentation on both sessions. Make sure to attend the next session and also watch Karen's BBO movie. Here I just could not control myself and not bring you our mastery on the table that day. First I have a brief from his introduction to "Raise of a Major Suit Openings" and then let you see the three board Joyce and I played.|

^-|CP||FP||ht|d|cp|8|at|^*B@2Thurston: |cp||at|To start, 2/1 usually has a greater and more accurate way to raise major suit openings. In Standard American or SAYC, 1M-2M can be 3 or 4 trumps, 6-10 HCP and that's too wide a range of support for accurate follow up. In 2/1, we usually add Bergen Raises and use 1M-2M as very specific: 8-10 with exactly 3 trumps.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


cp|8|at|

- |cp||at|The Bergen variety I prefer now is Reverse: 3C = a 4 card limit raise, 10-12 and 3D= 7+-10 with 4 trumps (a 4-card constructive raise). You'll note an overlap: at the 10 end" that's to distinguish good 10's from poor.  Aces and Kings = good cards, Queens and Jacks = poor. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


cp|8|at|

- |cp||at|So 1S - 3C with Axxx Kxxx Kx xxx(10 HCP) but 1S-3D with Kxxx Qxxx QJx Qx(10 HCP). After the raise, Opener will have a much better idea of when he should head towards game and when he should stop in part score.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


cp|8|at|

- |cp||at|The next change focuses on how to try for game after a raise. Opener will usually need a medium hand - 15-17 + to try for game after 1M-2M. And that add is in distributional points after the raise. For example AJxxxx is worth about 2 more points for the 6th trump after supported. In SAYC or standard, the usual way to try for game was to rebid the M -1M-2M 3M? to ask partner if she was min or maximum.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


cp|8|at|

- |cp||at|But that ignores the element of fit which is just about always more important - not "how many points partner?" but "where are your points?" In any case, what Opener needs to know is "do the hands fit well?"|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


cp|8|at|

- |cp||at|What we use to find out is a Help Suit Game Try (HSGT): Opener bids the suit she/he has losers in to ask for help and Responder goes to game with help and stays out with no help. It is easy to distinguish between shortness and helping request. Shortness applies after 1M-2N  and HSGT after 1M-2M.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


cp|8|at|

- |cp||at|Remember after 1S-2S we have a trump suit and that's what we're going to playing so bidding a new suit is not looking for a different trump suit - don't be greedy, one fit is enough. For this HSGT to work, we have to have agreed on a major (1M-2M) and have room to say "no help" by going back to 3M. If Help suit is higher ranked - it will only be so after 1H-2H-2S - then 4H with help and 3H with no help.|

^B@2^*BThurston: ^*N|cp||at|Yes you do have shortness somewhere with 2 suits but the source of tricks concept is very useful. Here, here, Responder knows his Ax diamond opposite KQxxx is like gold and the spade A has to be good too.|

^B@2^*BThurston: ^*N|cp||at|So he can make a try for slam (4S) despite having only 12 HCP because they are the right 12. Opposite shortness the @sA  would be good and responder might cuebid 4D. But he might also quit at 4H because of only one high card in partner's 2 side suits (@C and @D). Look at it this way: 3S would tell about one card, 4d tells about 5.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BThurston: ^*N|cp||at|The Kx is about 50% likely to be good help as is Kxx. So with "maybe help" like Kx, I accept if the rest of the hand looks good and don't with real trash. Qxx Kx Axxx xxxx = good, Qxx Kx Qxxx Jxxx = not so good. A good thing to remember is that on the HCP scale, A's and K's are undervalued while Q's and J's are overvalued. Honours together are always better than honours all over the place: KQxx is better than Kxx Qxx.|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
