^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said the bidding was fine. As for 3N vs 5D, as you know, I advocate bidding 3N whenever feasible. 3N is almost always easier than 5D.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets talk about how TJ might best play the hand. She can count 8 sure tricks, unless diamonds totally misbehave. She has 5 diamonds, 2 clubs, and one heart for sure. She needs the ninth. There are possibilities in both spades and hearts for a 9th trick. In spades, she can lead towards the @sKJ and hope you guess which one to play. But I don't recommend that, because you have a better chance in hearts.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
tjtoo: Should I have tried the spades first, before the Heart.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No you should do the hearts first. You have a 75% chance of taking 2 heart tricks. This is a very common suit position, and it is good if you learn it. When on dummy, lead low heart and play the 10. If I have the KQ that will win. But it is more likely it will lose. However, that is ok, as you still have a club stopper. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then win the club return and lead a diamond to the board. You can run your diamonds now if you like, but make sure you win your last diamond in dummy. And, then, play another heart and hope South started with one heart honor. The odds that one of 2 heart finesses work is 75%. You must play diamonds in such a way as to take 2 heart finesses.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One general principle of play is "lose your losers early" while you still have stoppers. That is why you need to take the heart finesse early.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|I had to rescue our teacher! Those who attended the session know what the Movie Maker is referring to.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


up|44|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets discuss the 2H bid first. Although you would like to have 4-card support to raise 1H, and you usually do there are some hands where you can and should raise with 3-card support. Bonnie's hand is one of those. When you have three to an honor or shortness (usually a singleton or void) it is ok to raise. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is clearly Bonnie's best bid on this hand. 1N is iffy with a singleton spade. 2D is not good. although she has 6 because Bonnie's diamonds are  very weak. Therefore, 2H stands out. Remember you should strain to "support with support."|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play. First of all with an 8-card fit missing the Queen, the finesse is the correct play - I think TJ has "finesse phobia" :). Yes, they sometimes lose, but they sometimes win too. TJ has 1 spade loser and potentially 1 heart and 2 diamond losers. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if she finesses South for all 3 missing red card honors, and I have one, she makes the hand easily. It is usually right to cash a high heart before taking the finesse.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case she needs to manage her dummy entries. So she should lead a low heart to the Jack. Even if that loses she now has 2 dummy entries in hearts. And she can eventually lead the @D10 intending to play low and make 5 if I have the @DQ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, it looks like Bonnie will lose 2 clubs, 1 heart, and 1 diamond. However, once we don't knock out her HA at trick 3, which is far from obvious. Then if diamonds happen to be 3-3 (and they are), then she can throw her losing heart on  the last diamond. Given she cashed the @SAQ removing her dummy entries, she has to be a little more careful. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But again, by "losing your losers early", she can set up diamonds. She can simply duck a diamond immediately (she is losing a diamond anyway) and then play the @DAK. She will then know if diamonds are 3-3, and if she can throw a heart. Now you do not want to be in 4 if it depends on a 3-3 break (36%) but you might as well see if you get lucky.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|TJ played that hand superbly. One suit combination I would like to discuss is when you have xx opposite KJx such as the diamond suit here. I suggest you always lead low and put up the Jack. Although that is 50%, if you are consistent, you will be the most successful. I have one partner who randomly plays the King or Jack depending on what he had for dinner, lol. And he is wrong more than right.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other comment. This is a good hand for those who play Bergen Raises in competition. My 3H bid has a wide range. it shows 4 card support with less than a limit raise. With a limit raise I bid 2S. But if playing Bergen in competition (most people do not), I can bid 3D, showing a 7-9 pt 4-card raise. So 3H would show 4-6 or so. However, as I said, Bergen raises in competition is not standard. Note they only work in 1H/1S-X-?, 1H/1S-2C-?, and 1H-1S-? auctions. Therefore, Bergen Raises in competition are usually off in most auctions even if you play them in competition.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, with 5 Spades I might consider a negative double. But I am more anxious to defend. I have a singleton in pard's suit and length in the opponent's suit. That means the hand is likely a misfit. If you think the hand is a misfit, you should prefer to defend.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some of you may think 3C is better. But, whenever you open and there is an overcall, and partner passes, and you are short in the overcalled suit you should strain to reopen with a double. Remember, if I double it is negative. But opener needs to protect against her partner having a penalty double. When partner passes you can almost be positive they are short in your suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a good hand to illustrate when you as opener should strain to make a re-opening double. That is after you open, and your LHO overcalls and there are 2 passes and you are short in the overcalled suit. It is quite likely pard is long in that  suit. Remember, the suit was not raised, so your RHO is probably short. So if both RHO and you are short your partner is probably long. Therefore, you need to reopen with a double.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other comment about 2-level overcalls. TJ was rather unlucky, however, in general, you should only overcall with 6+ cards or a good 5-card suit. A suit you want pard to lead. I think TJ's diamond suit is a bit weak. If I were her, I would have overcalled 1N. It is slightly off shape but it shows her points and hearts.|

With my first double, I already said I had 4 spades and opening points and that's what I have. I should only bid 3S if I have a good reason (like a singleton heart).

^-|HT|d|CP||FP||cp|1|AT|^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Understanding the Unusual Notrump (UNT) and Michaels Cuebids is easy. However, remembering the differences at the bridge table is a struggle for me. More importantly knowing when a NT is not Unusual or a Cuebid is not Michaels gets complicated though that knowledge is very critical. This tutorial is designed to lessen my struggle. You also may find it useful. |

What is an UNT?|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT| In general an immediate overcall of 2NT after an Opponent opens either a major or a minor is an Unusual NT - UNT.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


AT| I like the definition in Bridge Guys web site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/UnusualNoTrump.html^*N|CP||AT|,  "The Unusual Notrump is a conventional defense method designed to show two suited hands in competitive situations with one bid."|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT| The bid always shows the two lower unbid suits - at least five cards in each suit. Therefore, after one of a majors opening it always shows the |cp|1|at|two minors|cp||at|. And after a minor opening it shows |cp|1|at| heart and the other minor|cp||at|. Let's look at the four possible UNT bids by partner sitting North:|

With an appropriate hand 4NT is used as an UNT promising a hand with many points concentrated in both minors and not much in the suit bid by the opponents. Granted such auctions do not come by often. But, It is fun to know and use them when the occasion arrives. In all the following bidding examples 4NT promises both minors.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% WHEN A 2NT IS NOT UNT

Qx|b3|cs|1|cp|4|fp|2|at|
^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT    }
^-|cp|1|AT|
^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|So simply said, "An immediate jump to 2NT after a suit opening is unusual."|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT| Is there room for confusion? |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT| Of course there is.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT| If the partners are not on their toes and the issue has not been properly discussed then the question arises whether a NT bid is natural or unusual resulting in disaster.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT| Worse yet, in certain bidding sequences, even experts do not agree whether a NT bid is natural or unusual.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT| It gets really complicated because there are the 1NT and 2NT overcalls by unpassed or passed hands in direct or balancing seats. Just to make it more complicated the 1NT has different meaning depending whether it is an immediate overcall, an overcall by a passed hand or an overcall by a passed (or even unpassed) hand in a balancing seat.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


AT|

To have a better understanding of the complicated issue, first we like to present in part the summary section from the Bridge Guys web site and then look at Bergen's teaching followed with ^*IThe Unusual No Trump^*N by Alvin Roth. And finally to close the chapter with a detailed commentary by Howard Schutzman - our teacher and mentor. Explaining modifications to this conventional bid by other experts is outside of the scope of this work.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT| The good news, however, is that the complicated variations are rare. So fasten your seat belt as we are going for a rough ride.  First will be the summary from the Bridge Guys site.|

PG| ***** 151 ***** |


ht|n|at|"All of these guidelines may determine the employment of the Unusual Notrump and in deciding whether the Notrump overcall reflects which partnership agreement in the auction. Once again, it must be repeated that the vulnerability must be regarded at all times and the Unusual Notrump conventional defense method must not be used indiscriminately for any two-suited holdings. The requirements should be observed by the player, since the partner will otherwise slowly lose trust."|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |

". . . If you wish to include this feature, or any other feature, of the game of bridge in your partnership agreement, then please make certain that the concept is understood by both partners. Be aware whether or not the feature is alertable or not and whether an announcement should or must be made." |

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman    }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|In certain situations, which I will describe further below, you can overcall in NT to show some 2 suited hands. This convention is  known as the "Unusual NT". The reason it has that name is because, quite often, a NT overcall is natural and usually shows a strong NT. However, there are some situations where it is clear that the person who overcalls NT cannot have the "usual" balanced hand with the appropriate point count. In those cases, the NT overcall is deemed to be "Unusual".|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


AT|

I understand that here I should cover situations which may be vague or there may be two different interpretations of a certain NT overcall. So, let me briefly mention one special situation. If a partnership plays a strong club system, such as Precision, where a 1C opener is completely artificial, showing 16+ points and saying nothing about clubs, then 1C-2N shows clubs and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


AT|

This is in line with the general bidding principle that when the opponents make an artificial bid that says nothing about the suit bid, any bid that you make that could show that suit in fact does show that suit. Therefore, if a pair is playing a strong club system, then 1C-2C shows clubs. |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


AT|

Another examples of that principle is that 1N-P-2D (transfer)-3D shows diamonds. Having said that, if a pair plays the "short club" (e.g 1C can be as few as 2 clubs), 1C is still natural (in that it usually shows club length), so 1C-2N still shows diamonds and hearts.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


aT|

One other controversial situation. A few weeks ago, there was a hand in one of my mentoring sessions where the bidding went 1D-P-P-?. The person in balancing seat had a balanced hand with 19 HCP and chose to bid 2N. At the table, I corrected her, saying that 2N there would be Unusual, showing clubs and hearts. Afterwards, a few of my students told me my correction was actually incorrect, and that the 2N bid indeed showed a balanced hand with about 19-21. Let us look at that board.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|After some research and consultation with Marty Bergen, I did find out that, indeed, 1x-P-P-2N, is now played by most experts as showing a balanced 19-21, so I retracted my correction.

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|Unfortunately, it can get rather complicated as to whether or not a NT overcall is natural or unusual. I will try and cover the common situations. But the general principle you should use is, assume a NT overcall is natural unless it is obvious it cannot be natural.|
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


AT|

The most common situation where even a non-jump NT overcall cannot be natural is when the NT overcaller has passed originally. So, for example, if it goes P-P-P-1H-1NT that must be unusual. If the 1N bidder had not passed originally, then, as most of you know, a direct 1N overcall shows 15-18. However, since the 1N bidder passed originally, he cannot possibly have 15-18, so the NT overcall must be unusual. I play that the 1N bid there is kind of like a takeout double for the minors, and the 1N bidder only promises 4 cards in each minor (although they are often 5/4). With 5/5, I will usually still jump to 2N, as that is more pre-emptive.|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


AT|

What about if the auction goes P-1H-P-P-1N? In that case, 1NT is not unusual. 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-14 by an unpassed hand. So, even with a passed hand, the 1N bidder could have a balanced 11 or 12 Therefore, the 1N bid in the balancing seat is still natural.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


AT| 

Some people play what is known as a Sandwich NT overcall. If the auction goes 1x-P-1y-1N and you play Sandwich NT, rather than 1N being strong, it is a weak takeout for the other 2 suits. I don't particularly recommend the Sandwich NT, as you can always make a takeout double in that auction. But if you want to play Sandwich NT, I have no strong objection.|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


AT|

Another common case -- I recommend you play what Bergen calls OBAR (Over Opponents Bid and Raise) 2N. If the opponents bid and raise a suit, then 2N is like a takeout double for the 2 lowest unbid suits. Thus, 1H-P-2H-2N shows clubs and diamonds. Again, I play it only promises 4 cards (but is typically at least 5-4).|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


AT|

One case that should be obvious as unusual NT, but may not be unless you think about it. If it goes 2C-2N, that must be unusual. Although it is theoretically barely possible for the NT bidder to have a 15-18 1NT type of hand, why would you want to play in 2N when you know your opponent has all of the rest of the HCP? So 2N there must be unusual. I am assuming, of course, that 2C is the usual strong artificial opening bid. Strong club systems use a 2C opener as showing 11-15 HCP with clubs. If you encounter an 11-15 2C opener, then 2N can retain its usual meaning of a balanced hand of 15-18 HCP.|

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|One final reasonably common situation where 2N is unusual even when it is not a jump overcall. And that is, a 2N bid is unusual over any natural strong NT by the opponents. Although it is possible for you to have a strong NT when an opponent has opened a strong NT, it would not be desirable to play 2N when you know an opponent is that strong. In general, you would be much better off defending. Hence, playing 2N as natural over a strong NT is not useful. But playing 2NT over 1N as showing at least 5/5 in the minors can be quite useful and pre-emptive.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


AT|

Those of you who play DONT might argue that since a 2C DONT bid shows clubs and another suit (which could be diamonds), there is no need to play 2N as unusual over a strong NT. However, just like 3-level DONT bid (e.g. 1N-3D) shows a long suit (despite the fact that you can make a DONT double with a 1 -suited hand), playing 2N as unusual even if you play DONT is useful as a pre-emptive tactic. |
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


AT|

A similar situation is 1N-P-2x-2N. That also is unusual. Since the 2x bid is always artificial (Stayman or a transfer), then 2N is unusual. Over a 2C, 2D, or 2H response to 1N, which show major suits, 2N shows 5/5 in the minors. Over 1N-P-2S-?, you need to be more careful. If the opponents are playing 4-way transfers, which means 2S definitely shows clubs, then 2N shows hearts and diamonds. However, if 2S is a transfer to either minor, then it makes no sense for 2N to show both minors, since you know you are getting a very bad break in at least one of your suits. The simplest solution is to play that 2N over such a 2S bid does not exist. Alternatively, you could play that it shows 5/5 in the majors, but my guess is partner will forget that so it is not worth the risk.|

With two-suited hands in the 10 to 15 points category you should overcall the higher ranking suit. You may get to bid your other suit later. For whatever reasons most partnerships play "Mini"/"Maxi" system.|
PG| ***** 260 ***** |


AT| 

The conventional wisdom also has it that the 5-5 or better distribution is very important rule that should not be ignored. I have read, "Do not bid UNT with either a 5-4 or 4-6 distribution. At best it can confuse our partner and at worst it can give you a minus in the range of 800 and higher." This is very true in UNT as partner is forced to bid at the three level. Nevertheless, some experts may not agree. On the other hand 6-5 hands are acceptable for UNT bids.|

Alvin Roth has a very good point when he reminds do before making an UNT bid, "The Unusual Notrump has one thing in common with natural Notrump openings and direct 1NT overcalls. With normal 5-5 or even 6-5 patterns, you do not have to bid again to confirm your fine distribution and playing strength." |

"Partner heard you the first time. If he permits the opponents to play the hand in spite of your bid, do not overrule him; he is in a far better position to judge how far your side should compete than you are. The exceptions are when you are 6-6 in your two suits or when you have the strong Unusual Notrump hand. Raise his bid on the former and cue bid on the latter."|

PG| ***** 282 ***** |


AT|

UNT is a good example. Earlier the minimum HCP needed to make an UNT was mentioned. However, before I share a quote from Bridge Guys with you let me tell you what I like to do before making an UNT. We have seen most of what I will be telling you in the guidelines but it is worth repeating.|
PG| ***** 283 ***** |


AT|

Before I make an UNT bid I carefully look at the vulnerability, my position in the bidding cycle, the progress of the bidding, the quality of my lower suits - of course 5-5 is a must at my level - ,expertise of my partner, and finally what day of the week it is. Then and only then I consider making an UNT bid if the hand has 6 HCP plus. Why 6 HCP you may ask. Because most of my sources mentioned that number. Now let me get the quote.|
PG| ***** 284 ***** |


AT|

"Any 2 Notrump bid immediately after an opening of a Major suit by the opponents signifies that the 2 Notrump bidder holds at least 5-5 distribution at unfavorable vulnerability, in both Minor suits, or at least 5-4 distribution at favorable vulnerability in both Minor Suits. The point range should be 6 high card points plus, and should be mainly in the suits indicated. Remember that the distribution will be your main weapon. Also, the number of Losing Tricks may be the determining factor."|

One important point should also enter in the analysis before responding. In most instances partner has made an unusual 2NT bid as a pre-emptive or as an obstructive bid. With all considered - outlined above - responder should choose one of the known suits as the trump and make a further obstructive bid by jumping in that suit. Occasionally responder may look for a game or even slam contract with an excellent fit. But don't push it.|

mb|D|sk|n|lb|*bWhat would be a reasonable bid by North?^^4c|mb|4C|NT|^B@2
With an excellent fit in clubs and a partial fit in diamonds, North should be willing to compete in clubs. Based on the Law of Total Tricks, North should be willing to go to at least the four level even with unfavorable vulnerability. However, he can make a more aggressive bid of 5C particularly with favorable vulnerability. This could pressure East/West to overbid and go down.|
PG| ***** 363 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
North/South fare fine in a club contract - making 10 or 11 tricks.|
PG| ***** 364 ***** |

pg| ***** 365 ***** |


pf|y|at| You can play this hand double dummy if you wish. You also can make other random hands for East/West. Most likely they should take at least 10 tricks in a heart contract.|
PG| ***** 366 ***** |


AT| Because, in this hand East/West most likely bid on and reach 4@H which makes, therefore, an initial 5C by North would be a more obstructive bid.|

Now let us make North bid 5C|ub|5|mb|5cppp|at| and see how would they do in 5C contract. Again you can play this hand double dummy. But make sure you do not click the forward arrow.

North's options are 3H, 3NT, 5C, and 5D. None of these is perfect.|

AT| 3NT is practical as it is much easier to make 9 tricks than 11.|

The bidding is as shown above. On the first round South decided against overcalling (unfavorable vulnerability and not knowing how West would bid are good reasons).|

lb|*yShould South bid now^^Y|NT|^B@2
The answer is a qualified "Yes." Now South is in the balancing position with 9 HCP, East/West have stopped at the two level, North probably has some of the missing strength.|

2NT by South is unusual in the pass out position even though he didn't jump to 2NT on the first round. Partner should remember what Bergen says, "It is unusual if it is reasonable to be unusual." South cannot be expected to have much strength to bid a natural 2NT.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts play the following. Double of 4S is takeoutish, although on many hands responder can decide to pass, hoping that setting 4S will work best, especially if responder has a balanced hand. 4NT is a 2-suited takeout with 5/5, but not necessarily the minors. The 4N bidder could be 5/5 in C/D, C/H, or D/H. Therefore, responder should never bid 5H, and only bid 5D if he is willing to play 5H if partner is 5/5 in C/H. You can decide whether or not to put this in the movie. (I play this, btw, and it has worked well and does come up frequently enough that it is worth playing, unlike the lottery, lol).|

South can bid either 2N or 4N-depending on his partner and vulnerability. 4N is a more pre-emptive, more obstructive, cleaner bid and reflects the hand better. It quickly takes partnership to either 5C or 5D where they belong. BTW, in this position 1N overcall by South is natural showing a balanced hand showing 15 to 18 points.|

^B@2Some players only use Michaels on weak hands (<10 points) and strong hands (around 16+ points). With the intermediate two-suited hands with 11-15 points, they bid the higher-ranking suit first and hope they can rebid the other suit at their next turn. Other players simply use Michaels on hands of all point ranges, believing that it is more important to immediately show shape than to only show one suit first and then hope the auction allows them to show the other suit and their 11-15 point range.

ht|h|va|6|AT|^m@23D by North is Michaels, but since it is over a pre-empt it only promises a good hand with two suits other than diamonds. Partner is expected to bid 3H with heart tolerance. Hopefully the cuebidder can clarify which two suits he holds at his next opportunity; if he has spades and clubs, for example, he can now bid 3S or 4C.|

You have a weak distributional hand. Your options are Pass or 2C (Michaels cuebid showing the two majors). Most experts use Michaels cuebid to show a relatively weak, distributional hand with at least five cards in each major. The better the distribution, the more aggressive they can afford to be. This would be an acceptable hand to cuebid 2C if non-vulnerable. A fit at the two level is highly likely even if North has only a doubleton heart. |mb|2c|

The distribution is perfect for a Michaels cuebid - 5/5 in the major suits. However, the hand is strong (mid range) for a Michaels cuebid. You do not have to bid Michaels cuebid just because you have the fitting distribution. Make a simple overcall of 1S. You are strong enough to introduce your hearts suit even if West does raise to the two or three level.|mb|1s|

Again an expert North could have used the Law of Total Tricks and bid 3H reporting the presence of a 9-card fit. However, we are trying to prove a point and after all "nome" could be sitting North. Well Howard opined, "3H is pretty clear. I am quite sure "nome" would make that LOTT bid :)."|

PG| ***** 476 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The Michaels cuebid is used either with a relatively weak distributional hand (mini if you will) with both majors or a very strong hand (maxi) with both majors. For hands in mid range you should use a simple overcall. Of course there are experts who play Michaels with intermediate-strength hands as well.|

After a minor opening - 1c here - Michaels convention should be only used with at least five cards in each major. Bidding 2C (Michaels cuebid) can get you in a poor contract as Partner might have to bid 2S with only two or three spades. So, either Pass or make an overcall of 1H, showing your five-card suit. Most experts also insist that you should have 5/5 distribution.|

You have a two-suited hand but you cannot use the Michaels convention. A cuebid of opening one of a minor ALWAYS shows both major suits, not spades and diamonds. Make a simple overcall of 1S, the higher-ranking of the two five-card suits. It is possible that you can show your other suit next. |

Bid 2D. The immediate cuebid of the opponent's minor suit promises both majors and in most instances a weak hand. This bid at favorable vulnerability doesn't carry much risk since North is likely to have a fit with at least one of the major suits. It carries more risk when vulnerable. This is very similar to the earlier example where the bidding was 1C-2C|

A cuebid of 2H would show a two-suited hand with spades and an unspecified minor suit. With this weak hand by bidding 2H, you are possibly committing the partnership to the two level or the three level if partner doesn't have a fit for spades. On the other hand Pass is another option. You don't have to use the Michaels convention. It's a tool you have available.|

^-{        Summary         }
^-|HT|d|fp||CP||at|^B@2^Z@3When the opponent on your right opens the bidding at the one level in a suit, you can use the Michaels cuebid convention to show a two-suited hand:

 A direct cuebid of opener's minor suit shows both major suits.

 A direct cuebid of opener's major suit shows the other major and an unspecified minor suit. 

 You need at least five cards in both suits and either a relatively weak distributional hand  -  less than the high-card strength for an opening bid  -  or a very strong distributional hand with which you intend to bid again after hearing partner's response.|
PG| ***** 496 ***** |

BTW, the Michaels cuebid is the brainchild of the late Mike Michaels. 

A bid of a suit which was originally called by one of the opponents = cuebid. |

^-|HT|B|fp||CP||at|^B@2^Z@3When the two suits promised by partner are known, with equal length in both of the cue-bidder's suits, bid the cheapest one of the two suits shown. The level would be based on how good the support for the suit is.|
PG| ***** 505 ***** |


AT|  

If partner shows hearts and spades and you hold  @SKx  @Hxx, do not make the mistake of bidding spades, thinking that your king will make spades a better trump suit. If you get doubled in 3S, there is no turning back, whereas if you bid 3H, you can run to spades if necessary. With 3-card support, though, you bid whichever one is better. You need not worry as much about being doubled with a known 8-card fit.|
PG| ***** 506 ***** |


AT|

If the Michaels cuebid shows an unspecified minor and you have no interest in his implied major, bid 2NT to ask which minor he holds. If he has clubs, he bids 3C; if he has diamonds, he bids 3D. Partner can also raise the cuebid suit as a game or slam try. For example: |
PG| ***** 507 ***** |


HT|L|VA|4|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|1c2cp3cp|at|}|
PG| ***** 508 ***** |


ht|L|at|^m@2In the auction shown on the left 3C shows game interest in hearts or spades. The Michaels cuebidder is expected to bid his cheapest suit at the cheapest level.|

HT|Q|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|1c2cp3cp3h|at|}|ht|Q|at|In this case, 3H with a weak hand of around 0-10 points. All other bids show at least 10 points and are game forcing.|
PG| ***** 510 ***** |


AT| Some experts insist on a 5-5 distribution for a Michaels cuebid. Others, however, would bid a Michaels showing both majors like 1C-2C or 1D-2D with 5-4 or 4-5 in majors because responder is not forced to bid above the two level.|
PG| ***** 511 ***** |


at|^B@2

However, when the bidding goes 1H-2H (spades and a minor) or 1S-2S (hearts and a minor) the minor suit is unknown and the responder is forced to the three level. This may not be as dangerous as the case in 1H-2H situation when the responder can bid 2S - with spade support. In this case some people play that a 4 card spades suit is permissible as partner has only to bid at the two level in support of Spades. Otherwise, if responder does not wish to play in the major then he bids 2NT to get partner to bid his minor - at the 3 level.|

%%%% THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS FROM ACBL
HT|B|AT|^B@2In many respects The Michaels cuebid is similar to Weak Two Bid - descriptive and obstructive.

AT| North puts the partnership in a known eight-card major suit fit at the cheapest possible level - South is promising at least five cards in each major - the Law of Total Tricks is on North side.|
PG| ***** 518 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By bidding a Michaels cuebid, South generally has less than the values for an opening bid. Therefore,  North has no reason to look for game, particularly with such a run-of-the-mill fit with South's suits and weak hand.|
PG| ***** 519 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North should not consider bidding clubs. South is unlikely to have more than one or two clubs.|
PG| ***** 520 ***** |


MB|P|NT||sk|s|lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^p|NT|^B@2 
South should Pass. South has already described the hand with the Michaels cuebid and has nothing more to say. Howard always says, "Do not make a redundant bid." If North shows no interest in reaching game, South should not bid again. Please note that North's bid was a forced bid.|mb|P|
pg| ***** 522 ***** |


nt||sk||mb|Pp|NT|^B@2
It is hard to say whether North can make the contract or not - there are a lot of losers. In a good day North may even make the 2H. However, down one - the most likely result - is not a poor result. East/West have good possibilities in clubs or diamonds partscore. Further they can be pushed into reaching 3NT and going down 1. |md|0,skq2h965dk876ct62,0,st643ha4dajt9caj7|NT|^B@2

The correct bid is 2H. The double by West removed the obligation for North to bid as South can bid again. But 2H clearly shows the preference by North. A Pass gives the information that North either has equal preference for hearts and spades or lack of preference and South should choose the trump. This can get them in trouble if South bids 2S. Further, it gives away too much information to East/West. |

In this situation Pass is acceptable. North has equal preference for both majors and can leave the decision to South. |MB|P|

The bidding is as shown above.|
pg| ***** 545 ***** |


lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^3H|NT|^B@2
With what he knows North has three bids - 2H, 3H, or 4H. North has at least a 9-card fit with one of South's majors and South announced having less than the values for an opening bid. Therefore, 2H is a conservative bid but it doesn't take advantage of the obstructive value of the Michaels cuebid - East/West still have plenty of room to find their best contract.|
PG| ***** 547 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand North can get really aggressive and either cuebid the opponents' suit or outright bid 4H - that is really being obstructive. However, that may be going too far out on the limb. What else is left you may ask.|
PG| ***** 548 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A jump to 3H seems the best of both worlds. This is a pre-emptive raise - obstructive enough - , however, South could bid game with exceptional distribution - descriptive and is supported by the Law of Total Tricks. Now let us assume that our North bids 3H and East passes.|
pg| ***** 549 ***** |


MB|3hP|sk|s|lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^p|NT|^B@2
South has about what North expected - a typical hand for a Michaels cuebid. Therefore, has nothing more to do but Pass and hope to get the partnership to a reasonable contract while keeping EastWest out.|

PG| ***** 553 ***** |


AT| The 3H can be made if the spade losers can be held to one trick barring suits divide very badly, North should be able to have only one spades loser, one diamond loser and two heart losers  -  making exactly 3H. On the other hand East/West should be able to take at least nine tricks in diamonds or clubs.|

MB|P|lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^4h|MB|4H|NT|^B@2
To bid accurately opposite a Michaels cuebid you need to visualize how the two hands will fit together. North's assets are: eleven high-card points but two of them - the @DQ - are practically worthless, at least a nine card fit in hearts, and good help in the other major promised by South. So a jump to 4H would be a reasonable gamble.|

The take home point so far is that the responder to Michaels cuebid is usually the captain and sets the final contract. With interest in game cuebidding the opponents' suit is the tool to get further information from Michaels cuebidder.|

PG| ***** 584 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^4s|NT|^B@2
His options are 2@S, 3@S, or 4@S. But which one is the best - safest and most obstructive? Let us review what North knows in addition to what he has in his hand.|
PG| ***** 586 ***** |


AT| North/South are not vulnerable, have at least a 9-card fit in spades, and the opponents have more than twice the number of HCP - 28.|
PG| ***** 587 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2@S is a conservative bid and could not get the partnership in trouble. However, the opponents holding the majority of points and being short in spades would not allow North/South to play in 2@S contract. To follow the same line of reasoning the bid of 3@S is not really that much better.|
PG| ***** 588 ***** |


AT| The real aggressive bid is a jump to 4@S by North.|MB|4S|
PG| ***** 589 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the Opponents can either pass and let North/South play the 4@S - highly unlikely, double the 4@S or outbid North/South in minors.|
PG| ***** 590 ***** |


AT| For the sake of making the point let us consider that East doubles the 4@S followed by three passes.|MB|xPPP|
PG| ***** 591 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With only North/South hand open we can say that the contract easily is down two or three even if the hearts and spades are divided favorably. So, the best case scenario is that North/South might escape for a penalty of 300 points, since they are non vulnerable. And that could be a great sacrifice.|
PG| ***** 592 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With 28 HCP and a few added distributional points East/West surely can make game or even slam contract - 3NT, 5@C, or 5@D. Next, you will see East/West hands randomly produced. To try more random hands you can remove the North/South cards from the deck and randomly divide the remaining cards between East/West and play the hands with a partner.|
PG| ***** 593 ***** |


AT| Let us take a look at randomly produced East/West hands as shown above. You can play the hand double dummy if you wish.|pf|y|md|0,s32ht3dak976ck762,0,satha42dqjt8caqjt|
pg| ***** 594 ***** |


pf||NT|^B@2
There are many parts to this bidding sequence. By jumping to 4S, North is risking a loss of 300 or 500 points hoping that EastWest will misjudge the situation. EastWest could double for penalty while they could get more for bidding a game, or settle for game when they can make a slam, or bid slam when they can make only game.|
PG| ***** 595 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, East/West may not know whether North's jump to 4S is based on values with the expectation of making the contract and let North/South escape undoubled in a 4@S contract. We should mention that Howard considers 4S by North an overbid and continues, "Maybe if EW vul, NS not, it is ok. 3S is fine."|

The correct bid is 4NT. It's not a good idea to choose to defend 4S when you know your side has at least a 10-card minor-suit fit,  a partial fit in hearts, and a singleton in spades. To find out which minor suit partner holds, North bids 4NT and hopes that his partner does not play the bid as Blackwood convention. It simply asks South to name his minor suit.|

Either 4C or 4NT is correct. Obviously, West's 3S bid takes away North's artificial 2NT bid. If North wants to compete at the four level in a minor suit, North should not bid 3NT. The standard agreement is that 3NT is always a natural bid - to play - after a Michaels cuebid. North has no other way to play game in notrump with a strong hand.|

3@H is the correct bid. With an excellent fit in spades and a strong hand, West expects to make at least 4S. Slam is still a possibility, since West also has a useful king in whichever minor suit East holds. Cuebidding the opponent's suit shows at least game-invitational values.

Many experts who use the Michaels cuebid play that a 3D-a direct cuebid-is showing both major suits. In this situation, South is promising a reasonably good hand with both major suits. When the opponents open with a pre-emptive bid, you should not also make a pre-emptive bid. |
PG| ***** 659 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Please note, however, that there are experts who play a cue bid over a pre-empt only promises a good hand with two suits, other than the bid suit. For example  3D in this auction promises two suits other than diamonds and not necessarily both majors. Of course there are others who play the 3D differently.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
