^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It really didn't matter, but note how I played the diamonds to give the most flexibility. If they were 4-1 I would have remained in my hand. But if 3-2 I created an extra dummy entry. As I said on this hand did not matter. But on some hands this sort of play could be useful.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a sort of a mundane part score  hand but a couple of additional comments. All of you should bid 2D with my hand. If pard is on lead, you really want a diamond lead. Overcalls (especially 2 level) are not just for competing, but are often lead directing. So if you have a really nice suit, you should strain to overcall to make sure partner will lead it.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's talk about TJ's pass. She has to decide what she thinks is likely to happen. Part of being a good bidder is trying to anticipate what a likely auction will be. So, if she thinks Kiri is likely to bid 2S and she is going to bid 3D over 2S, she should bid 3D right away. It is always better to make your bids as early as possible when you can. Makes it harder for the opponents to exchange info. However, with her hand it is not clear, nor is it clear if they have an 8 card fit.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Other possible actions by Kiri are 3C and 2H (that is least likely). If over 3C, TJ was planning to bid 3D, then she should bid 3D right away. In other words, from TJ's perspective, the most likely bids by Kiri are 2S and 3C. If she is planning to bid 3D over those, then 3D right away is better. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One could make the argument that Kiri might pass, and we get to play 2D. That is true, but with our 8-card fit, unlikely. I am not saying that it is clear to bid 3D, but I am saying there are some good arguments for doing so right away.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about 1NT over 1C (and 1D) which is one of my least favorite bids. It takes up a lot of room, and often wrong sides the contract. So, especially over 1C, you should strain not to bid 1N. In fact, sometimes if I am 3-3-3-4 (4 clubs, 3 in all other suits) I will bid 1D with 6 or 7 points just to avoid bidding 1NT. Then bid 2C as my 2nd bid if partner bids a major. Not saying you should do that, but on this hand 1D is clearly preferable to 1NT although we will end up in the same 1N :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the bidding and the way TJ played the contract was fine. However, you should get in the habit of counting out suits. Had TJ counted diamonds, she would have realized that only 1 diamond remained. So, she can safely play a spade before playing the @HA and make 2 or 3. But making your contract is never a bad idea.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1D over 1C leaves more bidding room for your side. Also 1N over 1C denies 4 diamonds. It is true on many hands bidding 1N rather than 1D will make no difference. But why not be more accurate when you can. The modern tendency is to bypass diamonds when you have a 4-card major. And if you want to play that simple way, that is fine. You could also play that you always bid 1D when you have 4 diamonds and a 4 card major. But almost no one does that any more. The simple rule is fine (always bid 4-card major rather than diamonds).|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I use something a bit more complicated. I bid 1D if I am willing to take a second bid to show my 4-card major. So if I have a bad hand (6-9) I will bid my 4 card major rather than diamonds. But if I have a hand where I can take a 2nd bid, I will bid diamonds, particularly if my diamonds are 5+ or a nice 4-card suit. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If we did not play that 1D absolutely denies a 4-card major, then I clearly have to bid my major. If 1D denies a 4-card major, you could make a case for 2C, but that bypasses 1N which might be better.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If it goes 1C-1D-2C-2H, that is a game force (and partner is denying 4 card major). If it goes 1C-1D-1H, then 2H shows 9-10, 3H shows 11-12. If it goes 1C-1D-1N then 2H is rarely bid, that would also show a strong hand with 5+ diamonds and 4+ hearts. On this hand, we have an 8-card club fit, so 2C is fine. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One could argue, since my clubs are so good, even if TJ had a doubleton or singleton, 2C might be safer. So yes 2C over 1N would be quite reasonable. But if my club suit were not as good, say AQ98x, then 2C is less obvious.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice bid by Kiri. It is  not forcing but highly invitational. With 5 card suit and nice 9 HCP (A, K, and Q in long suit), assuming a spade fit, East is worth about 11 points in spades. So 3S asks pard to bid 4 with 15 or so.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about what Kiri should figure out when I lead a low heart. The heart situation is quite clear cut. First of all, yes, I don't have @HKQ. 2nd if I have six, Boater has 1, so she must have the singleton King or Queen. So a low heart is clear, and Kiri should expect to take 2 heart tricks. I would like to once again emphasize about trying to get in the habit of counting out suits when the bidding makes it obvious.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kiri did the best she could. I think double by TJ was reasonable but it was borderline. She has a 4x3 13 count and the @HJ, although not officially "dubious" by Bergen evaluation, is still quite dubious based on the auction and is not worth counting. Further, I tend to downgrade 4x3 hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss my 3S bid. Cue bids of the opponent's suit can be confusing. The most common use is as a limit raise or better. Had I bid 2S right away that would be 10+ in support of clubs. The other use is as a stopper ask. If it looks like NT is a feasible contract, then a cue bid of the opponent's suit asks pard to bid 3N with a stopper. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is what I meant in this auction. It is "asking" not telling. If I had a spade stopper I would bid 3N. Hence 3S must say I do not have a spade stopper. Some people call that a "Western cue" which is a very useful bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played. I guess one theme of this week is cue bids. Normally if you cue bid the overcalled suit right away that is a limit raise or better. 3S was clearly a heart raise. However, it was unusual because it was higher than 3H and it by definition established a game force. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, 3S had to show a game forcing raise. If it had gone 1H-1S-2S, that only promises 10+ points (although the upper range is unlimited). But 3S has to by definition be 13+ since 3H is no longer available.|

What is an UNT?|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


AT| In general an immediate overcall of 2NT after an Opponent opens either a major or a minor is an Unusual NT - UNT.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


AT| I like the definition in Bridge Guys web site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/UnusualNoTrump.html^*N|CP||AT|,  "The Unusual Notrump is a conventional defense method designed to show two suited hands in competitive situations with one bid."|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


AT| The bid always shows the two lower unbid suits - at least five cards in each suit. Therefore, after one of a majors opening it always shows the |cp|1|at|two minors|cp||at|. And after a minor opening it shows |cp|1|at|the heart and the other minor|cp||at|. Let's look at the four possible UNT bids by partner sitting North:|

With an appropriate hand 4NT is used as an UNT promising a hand with many points concentrated in both minors and not much in the bid suit by the opponents. Granted such auctions do not come by often.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% WHEN A 2NT IS NOT UNT

Qx|b3|cs|1|cp|4|fp|2|at|
^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT    }
^-|cp|1|AT|
^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|So simply said, "An immediate jump to 2NT after a suit opening is unusual."|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT| Is there room for confusion? |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


AT| Of course there is.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


AT| If the partners are not on their toes and the issue has not been properly discussed then the question arises whether a NT bid is natural or unusual resulting in disaster.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT| Worse yet, in certain bidding sequences, even experts do not agree whether a NT bid is natural or unusual.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT| It gets really complicated because there are the 1NT and 2NT overcalls by unpassed or passed hands in direct or balancing seats. Just to make it more complicated the 1NT has different meaning depending whether it is an immediate overcall, an overcall by a passed hand or an overcall by a passed (or even unpassed) hand in a balancing seat.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

To have a better understanding of the complicated issue, first we like to present in part the summary section from the Bridge Guys web site and then look at Bergen's teaching followed with ^*IThe Unusual No Trump^*N by Alvin Roth. And finally to close the chapter with a detailed commentary by Howard Schutzman - our teacher and mentor. Explaining modifications to this conventional bid by other experts is outside of the scope of this work.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT| The good news, however, is that the complicated variations are rare. So fasten your seat belt as we are going for a rough ride.  First will be the summary from the Bridge Guys site.|

PG| ***** 144 ***** |


ht|n|at|"All of these guidelines may determine the employment of the Unusual Notrump and in deciding whether the Notrump overcall reflects which partnership agreement in the auction. Once again, it must be repeated that the vulnerability must be regarded at all times and the Unusual Notrump conventional defense method must not be used indiscriminately for any two-suited holdings. The requirements should be observed by the player, since the partner will otherwise slowly lose trust."|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |

". . . If you wish to include this feature, or any other feature, of the game of bridge in your partnership agreement, then please make certain that the concept is understood by both partners.

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman    }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|In certain situations, which I will describe further below, you can overcall in NT to show some 2 suited hands. This convention is  known as the "Unusual NT". The reason it has that name is because, quite often, a NT overcall is natural and usually shows a strong NT. However, there are some situations where it is clear that the person who overcalls NT cannot have the "usual" balanced hand with the appropriate point count. In those cases, the NT overcall is deemed to be "Unusual".|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


AT|

I understand that here I should cover situations which may be vague or there may be two different interpretations of a certain NT overcall. So, let me briefly mention one special situation. If a partnership plays a strong club system, such as Precision, where a 1C opener is completely artificial, showing 16+ points and saying nothing about clubs, then 1C-2N shows clubs and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


AT|

This is in line with the general bidding principle that when the opponents make an artificial bid that says nothing about the suit bid, any bid that you make that could show that suit in fact does show that suit. Therefore, if a pair is playing a strong club system, then 1C-2C shows clubs. |
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


AT|

Another examples of that principle is that 1N-P-2D (transfer)-3D shows diamonds. Having said that, if a pair plays the "short club" (e.g 1C can be as few as 2 clubs), 1C is still natural (in that it usually shows club length), so 1C-2N still shows diamonds and hearts.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


aT|

One other controversial situation. A few weeks ago, there was a hand in one of my mentoring sessions where the bidding went 1D-P-P-?. The person in balancing seat had a balanced hand with 19 HCP and chose to bid 2N. At the table, I corrected her, saying that 2N there would be Unusual, showing clubs and hearts. Afterwards, a few of my students told me my correction was actually incorrect, and that the 2N bid indeed showed a balanced hand with about 19-21. Let us look at that board.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|After some research and consultation with Marty Bergen, I did find out that, indeed, 1x-P-P-2N, is now played by most experts as showing a balanced 19-21, so I retracted my correction.

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|Unfortunately, it can get rather complicated as to whether or not a NT overcall is natural or unusual. I will try and cover the common situations. But the general principle you should use is, assume a NT overcall is natural unless it is obvious it cannot be natural.|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


AT|

The most common situation where even a non-jump NT overcall cannot be natural is when the NT overcaller has passed originally. So, for example, if it goes P-P-P-1H-1NT that must be unusual. If the 1N bidder had not passed originally, then, as most of you know, a direct 1N overcall shows 15-18. However, since the 1N bidder passed originally, he cannot possibly have 15-18, so the NT overcall must be unusual. I play that the 1N bid there is kind of like a takeout double for the minors, and the 1N bidder only promises 4 cards in each minor (although they are often 5/4). With 5/5, I will usually still jump to 2N, as that is more preemptive.|
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


AT|

What about if the auction goes P-1H-P-P-1N? In that case, 1NT is not unusual. 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-14 by an unpassed hand. So, even with a passed hand, the 1N bidder could have a balanced 11 or 12 Therefore, the 1N bid in the balancing seat is still natural.|
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


AT| 

Some people play what is known as a Sandwich NT overcall. If the auction goes 1x-P-1y-1N and you play Sandwich NT, rather than 1N being strong, it is a weak takeout for the other 2 suits. I don't particularly recommend the Sandwich NT, as you can always make a takeout double in that auction. But if you want to play Sandwich NT, I have no strong objection.|
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


AT|

Another common case -- I recommend you play what Bergen calls OBAR (Over Opponents Bid and Raise) 2N. If the opponents bid and raise a suit, then 2N is like a takeout double for the 2 lowest unbid suits. Thus, 1H-P-2H-2N shows clubs and diamonds. Again, I play it only promises 4 cards (but is typically at least 5-4).|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


AT|

One case that should be obvious as unusual NT, but may not be unless you think about it. If it goes 2C-2N, that must be unusual. Although it is theoretically barely possible for the NT bidder to have a 15-18 1NT type of hand, why would you want to play in 2N when you know your opponent has all of the rest of the HCP? So 2N there must be unusual. I am assuming, of course, that 2C is the usual strong artificial opening bid. Strong club systems use a 2C opener as showing 11-15 HCP with clubs. If you encounter an 11-15 2C opener, then 2N can retain its usual meaning of a balanced hand of 15-18 HCP.|

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|One final reasonably common situation where 2N is unusual even when it is not a jump overcall. And that is, a 2N bid is unusual over any natural strong NT by the opponents. Although it is possible for you to have a strong NT when an opponent has opened a strong NT, it would not be desirable to play 2N when you know an opponent is that strong. In general, you would be much better off defending. Hence, playing 2N as natural over a strong NT is not useful. But playing 2NT over 1N as showing at least 5/5 in the minors can be quite useful and preemptive.|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


AT|

Those of you who play DONT might argue that since a 2C DONT bid shows clubs and another suit (which could be diamonds), there is no need to play 2N as unusual over a strong NT. However, just like 3-level DONT bid (e.g. 1N-3D) shows a long suit (despite the fact that you can make a DONT double with a 1 -suited hand), playing 2N as unusual even if you play DONT is useful as a preemptive tactic. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


AT|

A similar situation is 1N-P-2x-2N. That also is unusual. Since the 2x bid is always artificial (Stayman or a transfer), then 2N is unusual. Over a 2C, 2D, or 2H response to 1N, which show major suits, 2N shows 5/5 in the minors. Over 1N-P-2S-?, you need to be more careful. If the opponents are playing 4-way transfers, which means 2S definitely shows clubs, then 2N shows hearts and diamonds. However, if 2S is a transfer to either minor, then it makes no sense for 2N to show both minors, since you know you are getting a very bad break in at least one of your suits. The simplest solution is to play that 2N over such a 2S bid does not exist. Alternatively, you could play that it shows 5/5 in the majors, but my guess is partner will forget that so it is not worth the risk.|

With two-suited hands in the 10 to 15 points category you should overcall the higher ranking suit. You may get to bid your other suit later. For whatever reasons most partnerships play "Mini"/"Maxi" system.|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |


AT| 

The conventional wisdom also has it that the 5-5 or better distribution is very important rule that should not be ignored. I have read, "Do not bid UNT with either a 5-4 or 4-6 distribution. At best it can confuse our partner and at worst it can give you a minus in the range of 800 and higher." This is very true in UNT as partner is forced to bid at the three level. Nevertheless, some experts may not agree. On the other hand 6-5 hands are acceptable for UNT bids.|

Alvin Roth has a very good points when he reminds us that, "The Unusual Notrump has one thing in common with natural Notrump openings and direct 1NT overcalls. With normal 5-5 or even 6-5 patterns, you do not have to bid again to confirm your fine distribution and playing strength." |

PG| ***** 275 ***** |


AT|

UNT is a good example. Earlier the minimum HCP needed to make an UNT was mentioned. However, before I share a quote from Bridge Guys with you let me tell you what I like to do before making an UNT. We have seen most what I will be telling you in the guidelines but it is worth repeating.|
PG| ***** 276 ***** |


AT|

Before I make an UNT bid I carefully look at the vulnerability, my position in the bidding cycle, the progress of the bidding, the quality of the my lower suits - of course 5-5 is a must at my level - ,expertise of my partner, and finally what day of the week it is. Then and only then I consider making an UNT bid if the hand has 6 HCP plus. Why 6 HCP you may ask. Because most of my sources mentioned that number. Now let me get the quote.|
PG| ***** 277 ***** |


AT|

"Any 2 Notrump bid immediately after an opening of a Major suit by the opponents signifies that the 2 Notrump bidder holds at least a 5-5 distribution by unfavorable vulnerability in both Minor suits, or at least a 5-4 distribution by favorable vulnerability in both Minor Suits. The point range should be 6 high card points plus, and should be mainly in the suits indicated. Remember that the distribution will be your main weapon. Also, the number of Losing Tricks may be the determining factor."|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
