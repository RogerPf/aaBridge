^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Too bad Joan had only 1 ace. With 2 aces six is a nice contract. With only 1 ace 5 is somewhat iffy. That again illustrates why 3N is almost always a better contract than 5 of a minor. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on this hand where I have 2 singletons. Remember, if you never play 5 of a minor (except for the occasional sacrifice over 4 of a major) you will come out ahead in the long run. Playing 3N even if you have singletons and voids is almost always better.|

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|lb|*mWhich is the best rebid for East now?^2S~2C~2D~2N~1S but I will ask Howard^5|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a tough time for her rebid. First, let us count the hand. She does have 18 starting points - a medium hand - using Bergen Evaluation (adding 1 for the quality suit). The hand also is a medium hand - 15-17 - using traditional method. So, in theory, this is a medium opener, too weak to jump shift to 2S. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For East to bid 2S, she needs a maximum opener. Using Bergen Evaluation, a maximum opener is defined as 20+. One thing to remember in general (and I often forget this myself) is that if you use Bergen evaluation you also must use his point ranges for deciding how good a hand is.  Otherwise it is easy to overbid.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|To refresh your memory please click ^*GH2,|CP|1|AT| here^*n|CP||AT| to see the information Howard is referring to. You can return here after you have studied the information.

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, as you noticed his point ranges for opener in particular are considerably higher than the point ranges you would use with standard evaluation. Thus, 1S bid seems to be the better choice.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|1S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, you should be very uncomfortable bidding only 1S with the East hand, and if you chose 2S at the table that "would not be crazy" to quote Marty Bergen.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
chaps2: Just don't know why originally I didn't bid 1S.
|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea is to find your major suit fit. 1H by West does not deny spades. In fact with 4-4, West should bid "up the line", 1 heart first so if responder bids 1H over 1 minor, you should strain to bid 1S.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie, what is the maximum of of points Mary has?|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Please note that Bonnie was not privy to the previous information given by Howard.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not true, but let us accept that for the sake of argument. Is there any possibility you have game?|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|
bjmue:  It is not a reverse?|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct it is not a reverse. A reverse only occurs if she bid past 2D.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
chaps2: I have not limited my hand.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes you have Mary. You did not jump shift or reversed.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|
bjmue: Right so I guess she could have more.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is still a wide range (12-17) but it is less than 18.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay Bonnie, even if Mary has 17, do you have game? Is 1S forcing?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|
bjmue: No.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, with no possible chance for game, why take a bid?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
bjmue: But we have 8 card fit.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 8-card fits play nicely at the 1-level too. However, you don't have to bid 2S. You can if we don't pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The point of this hand is to understand some basic principles of constructive bidding. Constructive bidding is when your side bids and the other side passes. It doesn't happen much these days but it did on this hand. The basic objective of bidding is 
a) to bid game if you have it
b) otherwise stay as low as you can.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't get any more points for bidding 3S and making it than you do for bidding 1S and making 3. And the more you bid, the more likely you can go down. So, when you know your side does not have game, and the opponents let you, stay as low as you can.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
nome: Does bidding 2S prevents opponents easily get in the bidding?|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia does bring up a good point. You could make a case that Bonnie should bid 2S to make it hard to compete and to be fair, very few players would pass 1S. But the point I am trying to make is, once Bonnie hears 1S, it should immediately occur to her that game is not possible.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point is that new suits by responder are forcing. On the other hand, contrary to what many players incorrectly believe, new suits by opener are not forcing. 1S was not forcing. Opener must reverse or jump shift to make a forcing bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a very hard hand to play. In general, 6/5 hands are worth much more than their HCP. But if you have a misfit, as on this hand, that can be a problem. However, little did Bonnie know that the S9 was the critical card. Bonnie was right to like her hand, because most of the time we will have a fit somewhere and we did have somewhat of a heart fit. Although the 5-1 break is deadly.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, other than you should take the ace sooner, although it didn't matter on this hand. Often it is right to duck an ace, but you should not duck unless you have a reason. Ducking for no reason is generally not recommended.|

up|40|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand. First let's discuss Bonnie's bid. It turns out, although 2C is a valid DONT bid, Bergen recommends that with 6-4 hands, you treat it as a single suited hand. In fact, not vul, I would recommend Bonnie bid 3D over 1N. But vul, double is what Bergen would recommend, because a 6-card suit plays well over more holdings by pard. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, even on this hand, the 6-2 fit is better than the 4-4 fit. It is because, especially with an 8-card fit, longer trumps in one hand gives you more protection. Bonnie will be having to ruff hearts, and with 6 diamonds, she has more trumps to ruff with. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you may have heard that 4-4 fits are better than 5-3 or 6-2 fits. On some hands, it is true that you will take an extra trick or two in a 4-4 fit, because you can throw losers on the 5 or 6 card suit.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, it is almost always safer to play with longer trumps in 1 hand when you have an 8 card fit. One way to think about this is you would rather have an 8-0 fit than 4-4. 8-0 has to be safer. That is the same idea, if less extreme, between 6-2 and 4-4.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should Joan bid 3S?|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT| With a 4th spade, 3S would be clear. And it is possible that Mary has 6 spades and Joan does have very good spade support. So 3S "has merit" as I sometimes say.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT|
boater: I thought I was obliged to complete transfer?|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with a flat hand, and defense and possibly only an 8-card fit, I would tend to pass. However, 3S could very well be right. This is one of those cases where you just don't know.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
boater: It is bidding 3 over 3 without a singleton in clubs though.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well yes Joan. which is why I said I probably would not do it. But you could have a 9-card fit, and in fact you did and had you decided to ruff a club and take the spade finesse, you might make 3S. So 3S could have worked out well.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
boater: I guess I don't have to complete the transfer?|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is correct. Once we bid you can pass. And certainly with 2 spades or 3 little you should pass. |

^-|ht|d|cs||fp||cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Clearly the Bergen Raises in competition is for players who play either Regular or Reverse Bergen Raises. If you wish to learn Bergen Raises there is a great tutorial in BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or at Howard's web site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|.

Furthermore, Bergen Raises in Competition is not standard and a few original bids such as Jordan 2N are not available when you play it. Therefore, to avoid disasters at the bridge table you should fully discuss playing it with your partner. Again, Bergen Raises is a complete treatment for raising partner's opening a major and it would be best to adhere to all of its parts. All bids here are alertable.

BTW, you can play Bergen Raises in competition whether you play SAYC or 2/1. After interference 2/1 is the same as SAYC - I am sure you knew that.

And lastly, in my usual custom, the information is presented in a quiz format with hands and the appropriate bidding. I don't know about you but reading endless text lines quickly puts me to sleep. However, the guideline for each section will be presented in a text format first.

Now please click the forward arrow to begin the presentation.|

^D@2Raise to 4 = Responder usually has a weak hand with 5 trumps. After the double, slam is unlikely, so he might make a tactical raise with an opening bid.|

Bergen Raises of 3C and 3D are jumps, so if you want to show a minor, you can bid it at the two level.

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Note that 3C is no longer a "cue bid". It is simply a Bergen Raise 3C bid. If you happened to play Reverse Bergen then 3C just coincidentally has the same meaning as if you did not play Bergen raises in this auction, but it still is just a Reverse Bergen  3C bid.

I do not play nor recommend Bergen Raises over 1M-1N-?, since it is unlikely we have game and the defensive points are behind the opener, which is not good. But if you want to play it, you could use the same bids as described in 1M-2C-? above.|

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.

^-{^*BIntroduction to Constructive Bidding^*N} 

In this lesson, we will learn the basic principles of bidding, regardless of whatever conventions or treatments you play.
If you understand these principles, you will become a very good bidder, even if you play a very simple bidding system.
In fact, most very good money bridge players use a very natural style of bidding,
following these principles and using very few, if any, conventions. 
As one rubber bridge player once remarked to me after I watched him demolish
a pretty good duplicate bridge partnership using his very simple bidding style, 
"Match points (tournament bridge) is an interesting game, but it bears little resemblance to bridge".|CS|2|AT|

{^*BBidding Objectives^*N}

Non-slam auctions have only 2 simple objectives:

1. Bid game if possible, otherwise stay as low as you can.

2. Find a good strain (trump suit or NT).

You may have learned all these complicated bidding rules, but their only purpose is to
help you fulfill these simple objectives. In this lesson, I will teach you how to meet the first objective,
|FP|2|at|determining if you should bid game|FP||AT|. The 
subsequent lessons are related to meeting the second objective,
|FP|2|AT|finding a good strain.
^-|HT|w|FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BMovie Maker's Note^*N|CP||AT|: In all of these lessons, Howard assumes the reader uses traditional hand evaluation techniques--see more in a separate section. However, he now teaches, and prefers, the more accurate Bergen methodology (again see details in a separate section), but, because it is not familiar to everyone, he will not use it in these lessons. However, next, for comparison I arranged some of the information side by side. |

The following table summarizes how the partnership can tell whether or not they have enough points to bid game:

^h^*UOpener
Responder^*N           Minimum   Medium  Maximum
Minimum               No           No           Yes

Maximum              Yes          Yes          Yes|HT|x|at|
During the auction, both partners should always be thinking about whether it is still possible to bid game. For example, if your partner opens and you, as responder, have a maximum (12+) hand, you should bid game. Similarly, if you open with a maximum (18+ with traditional count and 20+ with Bergen's count) and get any response from partner, you should bid game. ^LNow please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR2, HERE^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
