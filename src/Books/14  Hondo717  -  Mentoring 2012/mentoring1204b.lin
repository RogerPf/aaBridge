^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing against NT the best lead is from an honor or a broken honor sequence. You only lead the top of a 3 card sequence or 3 card broken sequence (KQ10 QJ9 J108). Without such holdings select the opening lead from the longest suit. You choose the stronger suit if you have two suit of equal length. And if the two suits are equal in strength and length then you toss a coin :). In any case the lead should be fourth best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have only a couple of small comments. Hopefully all of you know by now to open 1NT with any balanced 15-17 even with a small doubleton in 1 suit. So despite the doubleton spade, Cheryl has a clear 1N bid.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Cheryl took the right approach, but let me talk about holding up in the spade suit. In general you hold up to prevent the opponents from running their long suit. As to how many times to hold up, I know there is some rule that teachers teach. But I prefer for you to be able to figure it out yourself. In this case, we have 8 spades between us. Cheryl is not sure if diamonds are running or not. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If spades are 4-4, then even if diamonds do not break - |cp|8|at|as shown now|cp||at| - , it does not matter, since we can only take 3 spades and possibly 1 diamond.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, had Vered had 4 diamonds and I had 5 spades - |cp|8|at|as shown above|cp||at| - ,and assuming Cheryl does not hold up as in this case, then when Vered gets in with a diamond, she leads a spade and Cheryl could have gone down, losing 4 spades and 1 diamond.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if spades are 5-3 Cheryl can and should hold up. The reason is, if I started with 5 spades, and Vered is the one with 4 diamonds, then she can still make the contract by holding up.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have  clear pass. But let me discuss the "San Francisco Bay" convention that Kia reported on several weeks ago. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Ally brought up the convention, but she did not know the name. So the Movie Maker named it "San Francisco Bay" convention. The actual San Francisco" convention is a different topic than we discuss here. Look for more information on "San Francisco" convention at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/san_francisco_convention.html^*N|CP||AT|.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that I have only 3 hearts. My 2 heart bid is usually done with 4, but occasionally is done with 3. If you play this convention, it works as follows. Vered would bid 2N as a game try. 
My responses would be as follows:
3C = 3 card support weakish opener (11 or 12)
3D = 3 card support max 2H bid (13-15)
3H = 4 card support weak opener
3S = 4 card support strong opener|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sort of similar in concept to Ogust. So had Vered and I agreed to play that, if she bids 2N, I bid 3H (4 hearts weakish hand).|sk||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's comment on the opening lead. Generally, leading away from a KJ is dangerous, unless partner has bid or supported that suit. It should be avoided in general. However, on this hand, a case can be made for making an aggressive lead and that is because we tried for game and stopped. That means we are probably close to making 4 with normal breaks and leads. Therefore, you might choose to make an aggressive lead in the hopes of beating what would normally be an unbeatable contract.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, in suits, avoid leading away from honors, unless that is the only unbid suit. Having said that, Cheryl only has two choices of leads. She should avoid clubs because I bid them and she should avoid diamonds because of the @DAJx. Thus, her choices are a heart or spade. the heart is safer, but the spade has merit as well. The heart could end up costing a trick if partner has the Queen. I would probably have led a heart, but been mad if a spade lead beat the contract :). |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other comment on the defense. Once Cheryl is in with the DA, her only hope of defeating 3H is to take 1 spade and 1 diamond. So, it was right for her to hope Toots had the DK. However, she should cash the @SK first, as it cannot hurt. That way at least she holds Vered to 3 without costing her the chance to defeat the contract.|

AT| Before I answer that, let me say the following. If your answer to a 4N key card ask is either 5C (1 or 4) or 5D (0 or 3) and partner signs off and you have not guaranteed in the bidding that you have the higher (3 or 4) (e.g. you opened 2C for example) then in this rare instance you should override partner.|

nome: I asked this question before but assuming that you were sure that Toots had the three key cards and you had the trump Queen what stopped you from bidding 7S?|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could easily have a diamond loser. You should only bid grand slams that are 80% or more. Further, we only have 8 spades, so we might need a 3-2 spade break which in and by itself is only 68%. Frankly, although it is fun to bid 7, if you decide to never bid 7, you will come out way ahead in the long run.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk a little about the defense. At trick five, Vered should continue diamonds and not touch spades. Remember I bid DONT, and, given I only have 4 hearts, I must have 5 spades. When you are in with the @D10 Vered, just keep playing diamonds. Remember, the bidding usually gives you good clues on how to defend. Think of yourself as "Sherlock Holmes " on defense, and use all your clues.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a few helpful points on Count Signals. As you know Howard has a great tutorial on the topic which you can get from either BIl library |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or his website |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|. What I have next is just a short note with a board for practice.|

%%%%%%%%%% Count Signals
BT||tu||HT|a|va|4|cs|1|cp|4|fp|3|at|^-{    Count Signals    }
^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Standard count signals are given when either Declarer leads a suit, or a suit is led from Dummy. In such cases, attitude does NOT apply. You are giving count to your partner.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


AT|

Standard count is to play your lowest card from 3 or 5 cards, your second-highest from 4 cards (unless you think it is too valuable-in which case you play your 3rd-highest); your top card from a doubleton (unless you feel it is too valuable- often a 10 or higher doubleton is not played first round). Some players use upside-down count and attitude. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


AT|

When you and your partner know Declarer's count in a suit (based on the bidding), it is not necessary to give count to each other. Giving count would only help Declarer (if s/he pays attention).|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


AT|

Giving count is vital when Declarer is attacking a side suit (perhaps in dummy) and you or your partner must figure out how many rounds to duck your Ace (to exhaust Declarer of cards in that suit) to cut the link between Declarer and Dummy.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|

If your partner has bid a suit and you have supported that suit, you will usually have 3 or 4 cards in the suit. If partner leads a high honor, your first card would normally be attitude (high if you have the equal honor). If the equal honor is visible in dummy (e.g., partner leads Ace from Akxxx[x] and Qxx is in dummy), your first card should be count (high from 4, low from 3 cards). |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


AT|

If the opponents are playing at the 5 or the 6 level, lead the KING (not the Ace) from AK combinations. This asks partner to give count in the suit (so you know whether or not your Ace will cash). Particularly when the queen shows up in dummy, your partner should know that attitude is irrelevant and count is what matters.|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


AT|

When you lead the Ace of a suit you bid (and partner did not support), and KQx(x) shows up in dummy, partner gives count. Many times, that will tell you Levinthal or not you can give partner a ruff.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


AT|

Obviously, you would not give count if it sacrifices an unnecessarily high card (e.g., J102)-go ahead and play the 2 the on the first round).|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


AT|

Next is a board to practice a hold up.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
