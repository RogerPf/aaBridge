^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question was asked about super accept after a strong 1N opening - 15/17. I always play super accept with four card support unless I have the flattest 15 points NT opening. Marty Bergen is a strong proponent of this method. It is based on the Law of Total Tricks as you can bid to three level with nine card fit. However, that is not the mainstream. The mainstream requires nine card fit and 16/17 points. That is something that the Partnerships should discuss and agree on.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the play is concerned Ann did fine. However,I have a few minor suggestions. With the diamond Queen opening you have no diamond loser, one possible club loser, one heart loser and two spade losers if everything goes wrong. You basically need one of four finesses to work to make the contract. As I mentioned I don't like to waste my trumps and would not ruff a diamond at trick three.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would take a club finesse after winning the opening lead. Then I would lose the heart finesse. Eventually when I get back to the dummy I would lead the spade ten or a low spade to the seven. Following my way we make the same number of tricks but it is technically a better way.|

up|32|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is not much to talk about the play. The under-lead by Ally is a good play considering the holding in the dummy - a rare occasion for it to be correct. On the issue of 1NT forcing, a passed hand with limit raise value and 3 card support has no good bid. With Drury when you have a limit raise and 3-card support you query partner whether the opening was weak or strong.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The more popular version of semi-forcing is that 1NT is semi-forcing by a passed hand. The idea here is, if opener has a minimum hand, since responder has already passed, there is little chance of game. So, with a 5-3-3-2 hand, rather than bidding a 3-card minor, opener can pass and play 1NT. However, the main issue is what happens if responder has a 3-card limit raise. There are 2 choices.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can play Drury (in which, by a passed hand, 2C shows a 3-card limit raise and 2D shows a 4-card limit raise); that eliminates the possibility of the 1N bidder having a 3-card limit raise. Drury is favored by people who open light in 3rd and 4th seat.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can probably guess, since I am not a big fan of light openers, I am also not a fan of Drury. So, one solution is to still play 1N forcing rather than semi-forcing, even by a passed hand; I play that with many partners, and it work out just fine. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other choice, if you prefer 1NT semi-forcing, is to play that you cannot bid 1NT semi-forcing with a 3-card limit raise. You revert to SAYC, whereby you bid 2 of a minor to show 10-11 points. Therefore, you have to play that new suits  by responder are still forcing, even by an unpassed hand. Again, I usually play that way, and think it works out fine.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My basic philosophy of bidding is to keep things as simple as possible. So, I think there is merit to playing the same bids as forcing whether or not you are a passed hand. Also, I suggest that most less experienced partnerships, particularly if you are new to 2 over 1, should play 1NT forcing in all seats, rather than semi-forcing.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the play. Let's count Vered's tricks. 3 spades, 5 hearts, assuming a 3-2 break, 1 diamond, and 2 clubs for 11 tricks. There is an easy way to guarantee a 12th trick even if spades are 5-2 and that is by ruffing a spade. That will give an extra trump trick.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| A second alternative is to retain control in spades and duck a club. That gives a 3rd club trick. I like that alternative even better because if the club finesse works you might even make 7. So Vered can draw trumps as she did, and play a club to the J. That loses, but the @C10 is the 12th trick.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted, if spades break 4-3, she also makes the hand, and that will happen quite often. So she was somewhat unlucky. But either the spade ruff or club finesse are better odds. As I always say, you should get in the habit of counting your tricks for all contracts. That way, when it matters, it will be easier to do.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
nome: Is the conventional wisdom that ruffing is better than finessing when you have both options true?|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruffing is a sure thing, finessing is 50-50. But in this case, if you ruff you only make 12 tricks for sure. If you finesse and it loses you make 12 tricks for sure. But if you finesse and it wins, you take 13 tricks perhaps. So on this hand, the finesse is better because you don't really care whether it wins or loses.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding. First of all, this hand illustrates the value of 2 over 1. Once Vered opens, Cheryl sees slam potential, but is not sure what suit or NT is best. 2 over 1 allows them to bid slowly and easily discover their heart fit. Cheryl did well to bid 4N over 3H. One other very minor point. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although 2N by Cheryl is certainly reasonable, since she has a diamond stopper I think 3C is another possibility since her club suit is so good. It is basically self sufficient. That means it passes the "singleton test", meaning it plays well opposite a singleton. In fact, even if Vered has a void, Cheryl most likely has only 1 club loser (if clubs split 4-3).|

Remember, often you upgrade or downgrade your hand based on the bidding. For example, if I bid hearts, then Cheryl's HK is more likely to take a trick. But when Toots bids hearts, it is less likely to take a trick.|

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
