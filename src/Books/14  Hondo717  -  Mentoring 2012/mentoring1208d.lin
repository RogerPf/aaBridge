^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To enforce my point let me repeat what I said in a different fashion. It is extremely important as responder, when you think there is a chance your side has game that you make forcing bids until you are sure what level and what suit is best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you know, leading unprotected aces is not a good idea. It is less of a risk when partner has bid the suit, but it is still a risk. So, although leading the DA would be acceptable on this hand, since I had a very good alternative (3 card honor sequence), I chose that instead. But, if you always lead your partners suit, you will be right much more often than wrong. And on this hand it would work out fine as well. Had I not had such a strong alternative, I would have led the DA.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first discuss the bidding. Why do I think Bonnie should bid 1H instead of doubling?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT| In general, it is better to show a 5-card suit with an overcall. On this hand in particular, Bonnie's hearts are so good and spades so weak, it is particularly clear. But even if we changed her hand around a little bit so that she had say @SKxxx @HAQxxx I would still recommend she bid 1H.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In competitive auctions, informing your partner you have a 5-card suit usually works best. On occasion, such as this hand, you might miss a 4-4 fit. But on many of those hands partner will have 3 hearts, so no big deal as you play in your 8-card fit. So the only risk you run is if partner has 2 or fewer hearts and exactly 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If pard has 5 spades they can bid spades anyway - that happens rarely. Moreover, the advantage of knowing the 5-card suit, so you can apply the LOTT, works out much better more often. Imagine if Joan had even 2 hearts and say weaker spades like Kxxx. I would still rather play in hearts with AKQxx opposite xx than 2S with Kxxx opposite xxxx.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
texall: Is advancer's suit change always forcing? Or is that partnership agreement?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play new suits by responder, be it to an opening bid or overcall, are forcing. However, some experts do not. They play the only forcing bid is a cue bid. I don't like that for 2 reasons:
^Ca) you then give up the cue bid as showing a limit raise or better;
^Cb) you get the bidding pretty high before you can show any suits you have.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I strongly recommend you play new suits forcing. Some impolite experts will tell you I don't know what I am talking about. I would not be as impolite, but I do feel their method of cue bid as only force is unplayable. But, as I always say, you need to decide for yourself what works for you.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
stanira3: On this hand after 2S would West be able to pass instead of bidding 3H?|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, but I think she should bid 3S. 3S would be a better bid, but I wanted to emphasize why Bonnie should bid 1H, and point about new suit forcing. The best auction should be 1D-1H-P-1S-2D-2S-P-3S-all pass.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play Bonnie could make the hand by careful handling of the trumps. She should have draw one more round f trump and then played spades and leave my high trump out. I ended up scoring 2 trump not 1.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the bidding. 1N was very good bid by Joan. And although I like being aggressive with 3-card support, there are some arguments against TJ raising. First off we are vul. Second Joan is sitting behind me so most finesses are losing. Third, Joan has shown spade values. Fourth, TJ only has has 3 little spades, no honors. Fifth, she barely has 6 dummy points. Having said all that, 2S is certainly ok, just that I would not have bid it. And since I did make it, what do I know, lol.|

UP|36|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand was fairly straight forward. At worst I lose 2 hearts and 1 diamond. So 4 was never in danger. And I would make the same lead as TJ.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding. Even using basic evaluation, my hand meets the rule of 20 - 10 HCP plus 10 cards in spades/diamonds. If you use Bergen "adjusted HCP", then I even get to add 1 for my quality spade suit (3 honors, 4+ card suit). So I have 11 "adjusted" HCP, making my hand 21 by the rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now what should Joan bid. If you play that a 3H cue bid by Joan only promises 3 card support, then 3H is ok. Many play that. However, I like it to show 4-card support, because on close games I like to know whether we have 9 card fit. so I do what Joan did, make a forcing 3C bid. But the bidding is easier on many hands if you can cue with 3-card support rather than 4. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, if you choose to play that way, I have no problem. I solve the problem by saying 2N by Joan is how I show a 3-card limit raise or better. But that is easy to forget, so you should only play that with partners who are not forgetful. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am sure you all know that a cue bid only promises limit raise or better. It is unlimited but the min is 10. Just as on many hands, if responder has an opener, they must make sure we get to game. Therefore, if you cue bid with an opener, that is still forcing. If pard signs off in 3, you still bid 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid by Joan. Many people get too excited with her hand and overbid. But remember, she has already shown an opener with 1C. So when raising spades, she can now give her point count. Some of you may remember my constructive bidding lesson where I classify an opening bid in 1 of 3 categories:
^Ca) using Bergen evaluation - min = 13-16, medium = 17-19, max = 20+
^Cb) using standard evaluation min = 12-14, medium = 15-17, max = 18+|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason for the discrepancy is Bergen has many add on  points. In any case, Joan can now tell me with her spade raise, which sort of hand she has. 2S = min opener, 3S = medium opener, 4S = max opener. By bidding 2S she is showing 13-16 Bergen dummy points.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


mb|p|SK|s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|let me count my Bergen declarer points. 11 HCP, -1 for Jx of hearts, + 1 for 5 spades = 11 starting points. Declarer addons = 1 for 2 doubletons  and 1 for 4 clubs = 13 declarer points. Since Joan presumably has at least 13, I can bid game. Just as a reminder, you need 26 for game  with Bergen evaluation, and 13+13 = 26.|

If she plays the @SK, the @SQ sets up. If she plays the @DA, the @DK sets up. When you force a defender to give you a trick to which you would not normally be entitled, that is an "end play". So although Bonnie was a bit lucky, she played it well and made her own luck.|

More importantly knowing when a NT is not Unusual or a Cuebid is not Michaels get complicated though that knowledge is very critical. This tutorial is designed to lessen my struggle. You also may find it useful. |

What is an UNT?|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT| In general an immediate overcall of 2NT after an Opponent opens either a major or a minor is an Unusual NT - UNT.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


AT| I like the definition in Bridge Guys web site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/UnusualNoTrump.html^*N|CP||AT|,  "The Unusual No Trump is a conventional defense method designed to show two suited hands in competitive situations with one bid."|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT| The bid always shows the two lower unbid suits - at least five cards in each suit. Therefore, after one of a majors opening it always shows the |cp|1|at|two minors|cp||at|. And after a minor opening it shows |cp|1|at|hearts and the other minor|cp||at|. Let's look at the four possible UNT bids by partner sitting North:|

With an appropriate hand 4NT is used as an UNT promising a hand with many points concentrated in both minors and not much in the bid suit by the opponents. Granted such auctions do not come by often.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% WHEN A 2NT IS NOT UNT

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT    }
^-|cp|1|AT|
^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|So simply said, "An immediate jump to 2NT after a suit opening is unusual."|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT| Is there room for confusion? |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT| Of course there is.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT| If the partners are not on their toes and the issue has not been properly discussed then the question arises whether a NT bid is natural or unusual resulting in disaster.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT| Worse yet, in certain bidding sequences, even experts do not agree whether a NT bid is natural or unusual.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


AT| It gets really complicated because there are the 1NT and 2NT overcalls by unpassed or passed hands in direct or balancing seats. Just to make it more complicated the 1NT has different meaning depending whether it is an immediate overcall, an overcall by a passed hand or an overcall by a passed (or even unpassed) hand in a balancing seat.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


AT|

To have a better understanding of the complicated issue, first we like to present in part the summary section from the Bridge Guys web site and then look at Bergen's teaching followed with ^*IThe Unusual No Trump^*N by Alvin Roth. And finally to close the chapter with a detailed commentary by Howard Schutzman - our teacher and mentor. Explaining modifications to this conventional bid by other experts is outside of the scope of this work.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT| The good news, however, is that the complicated variations are rare. So fasten your seat belt as we are going for a rough ride.  First will be the summary from the Bridge Guys site.|

ht|n|at|"All of these guidelines may determine the employment of the Unusual No Trump and in deciding whether the No Trump overcall reflects which partnership agreement in the auction. Once again, it must be repeated that the vulnerability must be regarded at all times and the Unusual No Trump conventional defense method must not be used indiscriminately for any two-suited holdings. The requirements should be observed by the player, since the partner will otherwise slowly lose trust."|

". . . If you wish to include this feature, or any other feature, of the game of bridge in your partnership agreement, then please make certain that the concept is understood by both partners.

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman    }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|In certain situations, which I will describe further below, you can overcall in NT to show some 2 suited hands. This convention is  known as the "Unusual NT". The reason it has that name is because, quite often, a NT overcall is natural and usually shows a strong NT. However, there are some situations where it is clear that the person who overcalls NT cannot have the "usual" balanced hand with the appropriate point count. In those cases, the NT overcall is deemed to be "Unusual".|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


AT|

I understand that here I should cover situations which may be vague or there may be two different interpretations of a certain NT overcall. So, let me briefly mention one special situation. If a partnership plays a strong club system, such as Precision, where a 1C opener is completely artificial, showing 16+ points and saying nothing about clubs, then 1C-2N shows clubs and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


AT|

This is in line with the general bidding principle that when the opponents make an artificial bid that says nothing about the suit bid, any bid that you make that could show that suit in fact does show that suit. Therefore, if a pair is playing a strong club system, then 1C-2C shows clubs. |
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


AT|

Another examples of that principle is that 1N-P-2D (transfer)-3D shows diamonds. Having said that, if a pair plays the "short club" (e.g 1C can be as few as 2 clubs), 1C is still natural (in that it usually shows club length), so 1C-2N still shows diamonds and hearts.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


aT|

One other controversial situation. A few weeks ago, there was a hand in one of my mentoring sessions where the bidding went 1D-P-P-?. The person in balancing seat had a balanced hand with 19 HCP and chose to bid 2N. At the table, I corrected her, saying that 2N there would be Unusual, showing clubs and hearts. Afterwards, a few of my students told me my correction was actually incorrect, and that the 2N bid indeed showed a balanced hand with about 19-21. Let us look at that board.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|After some research and consultation with Marty Bergen, I did find out that, indeed, 1x-P-P-2N, is now played by most experts as showing a balanced 19-21, so I retracted my correction. However, Kia, AKA the Movie Maker then looked at the Bridge Guys site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/UnusualNoTrump.html^*N|CP||AT| and found an example where it said 1x-P-P-2N|

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|Unfortunately, it can get rather complicated as to whether or not a NT overcall is natural or unusual. I will try and cover the common situations. But the general principle you should use is, assume a NT overcall is natural unless it is obvious it cannot be natural.|
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


AT|

The most common situation where even a non-jump NT overcall cannot be natural is when the NT overcaller has passed originally. So, for example, if it goes P-P-P-1H-1NT that must be unusual. If the 1N bidder had not passed originally, then, as most of you know, a direct 1N overcall shows 15-18. However, since the 1N bidder passed originally, he cannot possibly have 15-18, so the NT overcall must be unusual. I play that the 1N bid there is kind of like a takeout double for the minors, and the 1N bidder only promises 4 cards in each minor (although they are often 5/4). With 5/5, I will usually still jump to 2N, as that is more preemptive.|
PG| ***** 249 ***** |


AT|

What about if the auction goes P-1H-P-P-1N? In that case, 1NT is not unusual. 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-14 by an unpassed hand. So, even with a passed hand, the 1N bidder could have a balanced 11 or 12 Therefore, the 1N bid in the balancing seat is still natural.|
PG| ***** 250 ***** |


AT| 

Some people play what is known as a Sandwich 1N overcall. If the auction goes 1x-P-1y-1N and you play Sandwich NT, rather than 1N being strong, it is a weak takeout for the other 2 suits. I don't particularly recommend the Sandwich NT, as you can always make a takeout double in that auction. But if you want to play Sandwich NT, I have no strong objection.|
PG| ***** 251 ***** |


AT|

Another common case -- I recommend you play what Bergen calls OBAR (Over Opponents Bid and Raise) 2N. If the opponents bid and raise a suit, then 2N is like a takeout double for the 2 lowest unbid suits. Thus, 1H-P-2H-2N shows clubs and diamonds. Again, I play it only promises 4 cards (but is typically at least 5-4).|
PG| ***** 252 ***** |


AT|

One case that should be obvious as unusual NT, but may not be unless you think about it. If it goes 2C-2N, that must be unusual. Although it is theoretically barely possible for the NT bidder to have a 15-18 NT, why would you want to play in 2N when you know your opponent has all of the rest of the HCP? So 2N there must be unusual. I am assuming, of course, that 2C is the usual strong artificial opening bid. Strong club systems use a 2C opener as showing 11-15 HCP with clubs. If you encounter an 11-15 2C opener, then 2N can retain its usual meaning of a balanced hand of 15-18 HCP.|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |

cs|1|cp|4|fp|2|ht|b|at|
^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|One final reasonably common situation where 2N is unusual even when it is not a jump overcall. And that is, a 2N bid is unusual over any natural strong NT by the opponents. Although it is possible for you to have a strong NT when an opponent has opened a strong NT, it would not be desirable to play 2N when you know an opponent is that strong. In general, you would be much better off defending. Hence, playing 2N as natural over a strong NT is not useful. But playing 2NT over 1N as showing at least 5/5 in the minors can be quite useful and preemptive.|
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


AT|

Those of you who play DONT might argue that since a 2C DONT bid shows clubs and another suit (which could be diamonds), there is no need to play 2N as unusual over a strong NT. However, just like 3-level DONT bid (e.g. 1N-3D) show a long suit (despite the fact that you can make a DONT double with a 1 -suited hand), playing 2N as unusual even if you play DONT is useful as a preemptive tactic. |
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


AT|

A similar situation is 1N-P-2x-2N. That also is unusual. Since the 2x bid is always artificial (Stayman or a transfer), then 2N is unusual. Over a 2C, 2D, or 2H response to 1N, which show major suits, 2N shows 5/5 in the minors. Over 1N-P-2S-?, you need to be more careful. If the opponents are playing 4-way transfers, which means 2S definitely shows clubs, then 2N shows hearts and diamonds. However, if 2S is a transfer to either minor, then it makes no sense for 2N to show both minors, since you know you are getting a very bad break in at least one of your suits. The simplest solution is to play that 2N over such a 2S bid does not exist. Alternatively, you could play that it shows 5/5 in the majors, but my guess is partner will forget that so it is not worth the risk.|

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
