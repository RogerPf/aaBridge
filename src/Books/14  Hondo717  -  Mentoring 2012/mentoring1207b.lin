boater: In this bidding sequence what does Joan's 1NT show? She did not redouble.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|TJ's bid should shows around 8-10. She is actually a little weak to bid 1N. 2D is actually a possible bid. 2D in bidding sequence of 1H-x-2D does |cp|8|at|NOT|cp||at| show 10 points. You must redouble with 10 points. So any bid other than redouble (and Jordan 2N if you play that) shows less than 10 points. Absent a double, assuming we are playing SAYC, 1N shows 6-10.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^B@2
tjtoo: I thought we were playing 2/1 and I could bid 1NT with 6-12 pts.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then you are partially correct. You can bid a forcing 1N, had Bonnie passed, with up to 12. But once Bonnie bids, forcing NT no longer applies. Again, as I said you can redouble to show 10 points, so 1N is reserved for weaker hands.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib: Was Pass an option?|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes pass was definitely an option with TJ's hand. Pass is probably what I choose. 2D would be another choice.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|p|sk|s|NT||lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^3n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On most hands, responder is captain, meaning they are responsible for getting their side to the correct contract. However, when you have a max opener (18+), once partner responds, showing at least 6, then you assume responsibility for getting to game. Because you know that your side has enough points for game. When responder is captain, it is fairly easy to make forcing bids to keep the auction going. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|New suits by responder are always forcing, so opener may not pass a responder's new suit. On the other hand, despite misconceptions by some people, simple new suits by opener are |cp|8|at|NOT |cp||at|forcing. For example, if I bid 2C, that is not forcing. TJ can and should pass with a min hand and clubs, such as the hand she holds. Opener's forcing bids are reverses (2S is the only reverse available on this auction), and jump shifts. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jump shifts establish a game force. If I jump shift (3C or 3D), the auction cannot stop below game. That is because a jump shift shows 18+, so we must have enough points for game. A reverse is slightly different. It can be done with fewer points (16 or so). It does establish a one round force for responder, but does not establish a game force.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, I am simply going to bid 3N. Some of you would be worried about diamonds. But it usually pays to be optimistic :). Don't worry too much about bidding 3N with a singleton or even void, especially if pard has shown some values in the suit. People worry too much about bidding 3N with shortness.|mb|3N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|TJ  made that hand harder than it had to be. Generally, in NT, as declarer, you lose your losers early while you still have stoppers. So, on this hand, if TJ  plays the D10 on the D8, she sets up 3 diamond tricks. She can also count 3 clubs once the CQ is out, and 2 hearts, and 1S, once the SA is out. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So once she is in, she should take the club finesse. Even if it loses (lose your tricks early), she establishes a club. And then knocking out the SA gives her an easy 9 tricks. Please remember to try and count your winners at the beginning of the hand, and figure out what you need to do to fulfill your contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about Joan's 2nd lead in spades. When partner leads a suit, and you win the first trick and lead it back you lead back your "remaining count." On this hand, Joan had Qxx of spades left after winning the SA. Therefore, she leads low from 3 spade. If she had a doubleton left, she would have led high.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on the last hand, Bonnie started with A8x of diamonds. After winning the DA, she played back the D8, to show she had a doubleton left (her lead showed her "remaining count"). Once you learn to count out suits, leading back remaining count is very useful. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on this hand, when Joan led back the S5, that means, since it is the lowest one out, that she started with either A5 or AQx5 of spades and she did not start out with 3 spades.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, Bonnie can count out the spades. If Joan started with 4, that means I started with 2. If Joan started with 2, then I started with 4. You should get in the habit, when you can, of counting out suits on defense and having partner lead back remaining count helps you tremendously in figuring out how many declarer started with.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I have a clear redouble. I think the best way for most people to play after a takeout double is that any bid other than redouble shows less than 10 points. It is easiest and effective. So for example, if I bid 1S, that would mean I had less than 10 points.|

sk|W|NT||lb|*bWhat should West bid?^^p|mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After a redouble, TJ  can bid with zero points. Since Bonnie opened, Joan doubled, and I redoubled, she can't have very many points. So if TJ  has preference for a suit, she can bid it. It does not show any points, she can have zero HCP. On this hand, she could bid 1H, although since her hearts are not good, and she has support for clubs and spades, pass is ok as well.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^p|mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is an option for Bonnie. Often if the redouble is passed, opener passes as well. 1NT is okay, describing her hand. Further,  Joan has to bid if you pass. Otherwise we get to play 1D redoubled, and I would love for that to happen. On the other hand, the auction will not die if you passed.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, since Bonnie did not open 1N, she has at most 14. I am showing hearts. And since I passed 10-11 HCP, Bonnie knows game is unlikely. But with her nice diamonds and a max (14 HCP) she could venture 2N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had TJ played clubs I absolutely have clubs stopped, although it might not be obvious. The @C10 is a critical card. Let's say TJ leads a low club. I put in the 10, and then Joan is on lead, so I have clubs stopper. And if TJ leads the @CQ or @CJ (if she had one of them), I cover with the @CK, and even if Joan leads a club, my @c10 is a stopper.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Everything through 3C is fine. You did well TJ to go down 1, 3N is a hard contract. Bonnie should not bid over 3C. The purpose of DONT is to either get to play a partial at the 2-level or at least force the opponents out of 1NT. Once that occurs, you have done what DONT has intended. So Bonnie should pass 3C, and it sounds like she meant to. Now what about Joan. 3N is not totally unreasonable with 6 clubs and 8 HCP but it is a tad risky.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a question about clarifying how to compete after interference over 1N. We already talked about Systems On Stolen Bid Double. The other possible conventional bid is a cue bid of the opponent's suit, 3D on this hand. That is game forcing Stayman. If Joan had 9+ points and a 4-card major, that is what she could bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an interesting bidding hand. The issue is, what does a 2S opener mean in 4th seat? First of all, it is not a classic Weak-2. The idea of a weak 2 is to make it hard for the opponents, who presumably have more points from getting to their best contract. In 4th seat, if you pass, then you have prevented the opponents from getting to their best spot :). Therefore, opening 2S in 4th seat definitely does not show 5-10 and a 6-card suit. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 schools of thought on what it should show. The more mainstream method is it shows a minish hand (11-14 HCP or so) with a nice suit. The Marty Bergen theory is it shows 9-12 instead of 11-14. I would have probably passed with TJ's hand, as I use the more mainstream theory, although with Bergen starting points, it does evaluate to 11 due to the Aces and Tens. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using the Bergen theory TJ can open 2S. Even some mainstream experts would open 2S. Some use the rule of 15, which also works on this hand (HCP + spade length at least 15). I am not a big believer in the rule of 15, nor are most experts. As many of you know, I believe in rule of 20 in all seats. You need to pick the style that works best for you.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand does not meet the rule of 20, unless you adjusted for your 4 Aces and 10s, it has 10 HCP and 9 in spades and diamonds. You cannot count length points in rule of 20. That is an important point. When using the rule of 20, even if you use Bergen hand evaluation rules, you do not count length. The rule of 20 takes care of length when it counts the length of your 2 longest suits. If you also used it as part of Bergen hand evaluation you would be counting length twice. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What Bergen says about the HCP part of the rule of 20 is you use "adjusted HCP" which means you use the other 4 starting point rules (HCP, quality suits, dubious shortness, adjust3) but not length to calculate your HCP. So TJ's hand has 11 "adjusted" HCP, 10 HCP plus 1 points for 4 ace/tens. Enough to open 1S using the rule of 20. But 2S is still a good opening bid  with that hand in 4th seat. The points must be evenly spread out, so it is good to make it hard for the opponents to compete.|

Generally all should go smoothly when your partner opens 1NT, or 2NT, or opens 2C and rebids 2N and the opponents stay out of bidding. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|

After a 1NT opening, the options available for responder, based on distribution and strength are 2N, 2C (Stayman), 2D/2H (transfer to majors), 2S (transfer to minors - notwithstanding 4-way transfers), 3C/3D (invitation to 3N), and 3H/3S (forcing to game/invitation to slam), 4D/4H (Texas transfer to majors). Responder's option after a 2NT bid or 2C with 2NT rebid are very similar - Stayman, transfers and etc.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

On the other hand when the opponents make a direct double or overcall a 1NT or 2NT things get a bit problematic. In majority of instances the reason is lack of previous understanding between the partners as how to handle the interference after a NT opening.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT|

Experts use different methods to handle such interference. Lebensohl is probably the most comprehensive one. However, it is very complicated and not easy for average partnerships to adopt. On the other hand, there are other methods which a partnership can adopt and be able to defend against the interference and avoid 99% of mishaps.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT|

In this tutorial we plan to present in detail the method Howard recommends and seems fully acceptable by many other experts. For ease of understanding here we divide the interference into:

^CWhen the NT bid is DOUBLED
^CWhen the NT is OVERCALLED|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


AT|

Knowing whether the interference is conventional or natural is important but is not essential. Regardless, it is not the aim of this tutorial to address the nature of interference after NT openings. So without further ado let us look at some examples. In the following examples after partner opens NT, first we deal with responder's option in uncontested bidding followed by options after an immediate double.|

The double of 1NT in modern competitive bidding usually is used as a form of takeout. Therefore, it should be ignored as it does not use up any bidding space. The partnership can continue to use transfers and Stayman. Further, another bid become available after the double of 1NT. That is redouble where the responder can show a hand with 8 points or more which may not be suitable for either Stayman or transfer - see next example.|

NT|^B@2
Could we do it after a 2NT opening?|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT| Affirmative.|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |

Next let us deal with an overcall of a NT opening. Again in the following examples we review the standard bidding option when there is no overcall first.|

As you see the 2C overcall has not restricted responder's options. Responder can simply bid 2D to transfer to hearts and pass after opener's 2H bid.|

I am sure you have the picture. North was going to bid 2D transferring to hearts. But West got his/her nose in and took that option away. The remedy is simple. North should double sending the "|cp|1|at|Systems On Stolen Bid Double|cp||at|" message to partner.|

PG| ***** 186 ***** |

So by using the "Systems On Stolen Bid Double" method you can handle the majority of interferences either by ignoring it or doubling. But what if the 2S is the overcall as we see next.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on this example, South would still like to play 3N but does not have a spade stopper. Therefore he cue bids 3S, which denies a spade stopper, and asks North to bid 3N with a stopper. Further, he may consider 4H bid and risk a 5-2 trump as he has the top two trumps. This is no different than many auctions where the opponent has overcalled and someone cue bids the overcalled suit to ask partner for a stopper (sometimes called a "Western cue bid").|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
