^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H is the correct bid. That means, since 2H established a game force if I jump to game I have a weaker hand than if I bid slowly. The idea is, you want to bid slowly if you think you have slam. If you take up a lot of bidding room by jumping, that is weak and shows no slam interest.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the major philosophical difference between SAYC and 2/1. In SAYC, if I jumped here, it would show a stronger hand. In SAYC we are not in a game forcing auction. So I cannot bid slowly if I know we have game.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also have what is known as a "self sufficient" suit. That means I am happy to play opposite a singleton in partner's hand. Marty Bergen calls that the "singleton" test. Of course, on this hand as you will see shortly, with the horrible heart break, and bad fit, I am in trouble. But with a normal heart break I would have no heart losers.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|TJ made the best lead. On a non-diamond lead, I might make the hand, by setting up my spades to pitch a diamond. Of course on this hand spades don't break either.|

mb|1S|sk|n|NT||mb|2d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie your 2D bid is a reverse and you are not close to being strong enough. A reverse takes up extra bidding room by bypassing your first suit. Here 1S is cheaper than 2C. But 2D is higher than 2C. So you reverse if your first bid at 2-level (2C here) is still available and you choose not to bid it. So let me give you an undo.|

sb|s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie gave me a suit preference. When you lead a card for partner to ruff, the size of the card tells pard which suit to lead back. The non-trump remaining suits are diamonds and hearts. A high club says lead a heart. A low club says lead a diamond. In this case, if Bonnie trusts that I was carefully watching the club spots (and I was), she should lead the C7, saying she has no preference as to what I lead back. Even if Bonnie doesn't have the DA, the finesse was working anyway, so no big deal.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about opening bids by Boater and Bonnie. Should Boater open?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT| Using non-Bergen, she has 12 HCP and 4-4 in the majors, so it theoretically is an opener perhaps. But if you use Bergen "adjusted HCP" then she deducts 1 for QJ of diamonds, and 1 for all her quacks, so hand only has 10 adjusted HCP. Therefore, Boater made a nice pass.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now should Bonnie open?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT| She has 11 adjusted HCP - 10 HCP + 1 for quality suit - plus 9 minor cards making the hand meet the rule of 20. So it is an opener - barely. But there are some tactics here. I am a passed hand, so the points are evenly divided and Bonnie is short in the majors. So there is a good chance we will be outbid. From a tactical perspective she might pass and, as it turns out, saves us 140 points. But that is pretty advanced, I don't mind her opening.|

PG| ***** 52 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I explained I bid 1H because the modern tendency is to bypass diamonds to bid a major over 1C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One comment on TJs bid. I could theoretically have 0 points. TJ has a great hand on this auction. But 3H is probably more prudent. After a takeout double, 3H shows more than a medium hand. It asks me to bid 4 with as little as 5 or 6 and we get to 4 anyway.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is another example of fast arrival vs. slow arrival. Bonnie is interested in slam so she bids 3H. With a minimum opener she would bid 4H to show a weak hand with no slam interest.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Boater should be interested in slam. Let's count her declarer points. 11 HCP and 2 length points = 13. For declarer add ons she has 2 for singleton, extra 1 for six card suit which gives her a total of 16. Bonnie needs 17 dummy points for slam, which is possible.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||mb|4C|an|control in !C|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a "control bid" which shows 1st or 2nd round control in clubs. First round = Ace or void. Second round = King or singleton. 4C also denies a spade control. Normally you bid the cheapest control you can. |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So by bidding 4C, Boater is denying she has a spade control, because she bypassed spades. Therefore, Bonnie should bid 4H.|

^-|HT|d|CP||FP||cp|1|AT|^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Understanding the Unusual Notrump (UNT) and Michaels Cuebids is easy. However, remembering the differences at the bridge table is a struggle for me. More importantly knowing when a NT is not Unusual or a Cuebid is not Michaels gets complicated though that knowledge is very critical. This tutorial is designed to lessen my struggle. You also may find it useful. |

What is an UNT?|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


AT| In general an immediate overcall of 2NT after an Opponent opens either a major or a minor is an Unusual NT - UNT.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT| I like the definition in Bridge Guys web site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/UnusualNoTrump.html^*N|CP||AT|,  "The Unusual Notrump is a conventional defense method designed to show two suited hands in competitive situations with one bid."|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT| The bid always shows the two lower unbid suits - at least five cards in each suit. Therefore, after one of a majors opening it always shows the |cp|1|at|two minors|cp||at|. And after a minor opening it shows |cp|1|at| heart and the other minor|cp||at|. Let's look at the four possible UNT bids by partner sitting North:|

With an appropriate hand 4NT is used as an UNT promising a hand with many points concentrated in both minors and not much in the suit bid by the opponents. Granted such auctions do not come by often. But, It is fun to know and use them when the occasion arrives. In all the following bidding examples 4NT promises both minors.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% WHEN A 2NT IS NOT UNT

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT    }
^-|cp|1|AT|
^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|So simply said, "An immediate jump to 2NT after a suit opening is unusual."|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT| Is there room for confusion? |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


AT| Of course there is.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT| If the partners are not on their toes and the issue has not been properly discussed then the question arises whether a NT bid is natural or unusual resulting in disaster.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT| Worse yet, in certain bidding sequences, even experts do not agree whether a NT bid is natural or unusual.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT| It gets really complicated because there are the 1NT and 2NT overcalls by unpassed or passed hands in direct or balancing seats. Just to make it more complicated the 1NT has different meaning depending whether it is an immediate overcall, an overcall by a passed hand or an overcall by a passed (or even unpassed) hand in a balancing seat.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

To have a better understanding of the complicated issue, first we like to present in part the summary section from the Bridge Guys web site and then look at Bergen's teaching followed with ^*IThe Unusual No Trump^*N by Alvin Roth. And finally to close the chapter with a detailed commentary by Howard Schutzman - our teacher and mentor. Explaining modifications to this conventional bid by other experts is outside of the scope of this work.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


AT| The good news, however, is that the complicated variations are rare. So fasten your seat belt as we are going for a rough ride.  First will be the summary from the Bridge Guys site.|

PG| ***** 183 ***** |


ht|n|at|"All of these guidelines may determine the employment of the Unusual Notrump and in deciding whether the Notrump overcall reflects which partnership agreement in the auction. Once again, it must be repeated that the vulnerability must be regarded at all times and the Unusual Notrump conventional defense method must not be used indiscriminately for any two-suited holdings. The requirements should be observed by the player, since the partner will otherwise slowly lose trust."|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |

". . . If you wish to include this feature, or any other feature, of the game of bridge in your partnership agreement, then please make certain that the concept is understood by both partners. Be aware whether or not the feature is alertable or not and whether an announcement should or must be made." |

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman    }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|In certain situations, which I will describe further below, you can overcall in NT to show some 2 suited hands. This convention is  known as the "Unusual NT". The reason it has that name is because, quite often, a NT overcall is natural and usually shows a strong NT. However, there are some situations where it is clear that the person who overcalls NT cannot have the "usual" balanced hand with the appropriate point count. In those cases, the NT overcall is deemed to be "Unusual".|
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


AT|

I understand that here I should cover situations which may be vague or there may be two different interpretations of a certain NT overcall. So, let me briefly mention one special situation. If a partnership plays a strong club system, such as Precision, where a 1C opener is completely artificial, showing 16+ points and saying nothing about clubs, then 1C-2N shows clubs and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


AT|

This is in line with the general bidding principle that when the opponents make an artificial bid that says nothing about the suit bid, any bid that you make that could show that suit in fact does show that suit. Therefore, if a pair is playing a strong club system, then 1C-2C shows clubs. |
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


AT|

Another examples of that principle is that 1N-P-2D (transfer)-3D shows diamonds. Having said that, if a pair plays the "short club" (e.g 1C can be as few as 2 clubs), 1C is still natural (in that it usually shows club length), so 1C-2N still shows diamonds and hearts.|
PG| ***** 258 ***** |


aT|

One other controversial situation. A few weeks ago, there was a hand in one of my mentoring sessions where the bidding went 1D-P-P-?. The person in balancing seat had a balanced hand with 19 HCP and chose to bid 2N. At the table, I corrected her, saying that 2N there would be Unusual, showing clubs and hearts. Afterwards, a few of my students told me my correction was actually incorrect, and that the 2N bid indeed showed a balanced hand with about 19-21. Let us look at that board.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|After some research and consultation with Marty Bergen, I did find out that, indeed, 1x-P-P-2N, is now played by most experts as showing a balanced 19-21, so I retracted my correction.

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|Unfortunately, it can get rather complicated as to whether or not a NT overcall is natural or unusual. I will try and cover the common situations. But the general principle you should use is, assume a NT overcall is natural unless it is obvious it cannot be natural.|
PG| ***** 267 ***** |


AT|

The most common situation where even a non-jump NT overcall cannot be natural is when the NT overcaller has passed originally. So, for example, if it goes P-P-P-1H-1NT that must be unusual. If the 1N bidder had not passed originally, then, as most of you know, a direct 1N overcall shows 15-18. However, since the 1N bidder passed originally, he cannot possibly have 15-18, so the NT overcall must be unusual. I play that the 1N bid there is kind of like a takeout double for the minors, and the 1N bidder only promises 4 cards in each minor (although they are often 5/4). With 5/5, I will usually still jump to 2N, as that is more pre-emptive.|
PG| ***** 268 ***** |


AT|

What about if the auction goes P-1H-P-P-1N? In that case, 1NT is not unusual. 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-14 by an unpassed hand. So, even with a passed hand, the 1N bidder could have a balanced 11 or 12 Therefore, the 1N bid in the balancing seat is still natural.|
PG| ***** 269 ***** |


AT| 

Some people play what is known as a Sandwich NT overcall. If the auction goes 1x-P-1y-1N and you play Sandwich NT, rather than 1N being strong, it is a weak takeout for the other 2 suits. I don't particularly recommend the Sandwich NT, as you can always make a takeout double in that auction. But if you want to play Sandwich NT, I have no strong objection.|
PG| ***** 270 ***** |


AT|

Another common case -- I recommend you play what Bergen calls OBAR (Over Opponents Bid and Raise) 2N. If the opponents bid and raise a suit, then 2N is like a takeout double for the 2 lowest unbid suits. Thus, 1H-P-2H-2N shows clubs and diamonds. Again, I play it only promises 4 cards (but is typically at least 5-4).|
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


AT|

One case that should be obvious as unusual NT, but may not be unless you think about it. If it goes 2C-2N, that must be unusual. Although it is theoretically barely possible for the NT bidder to have a 15-18 1NT type of hand, why would you want to play in 2N when you know your opponent has all of the rest of the HCP? So 2N there must be unusual. I am assuming, of course, that 2C is the usual strong artificial opening bid. Strong club systems use a 2C opener as showing 11-15 HCP with clubs. If you encounter an 11-15 2C opener, then 2N can retain its usual meaning of a balanced hand of 15-18 HCP.|

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|One final reasonably common situation where 2N is unusual even when it is not a jump overcall. And that is, a 2N bid is unusual over any natural strong NT by the opponents. Although it is possible for you to have a strong NT when an opponent has opened a strong NT, it would not be desirable to play 2N when you know an opponent is that strong. In general, you would be much better off defending. Hence, playing 2N as natural over a strong NT is not useful. But playing 2NT over 1N as showing at least 5/5 in the minors can be quite useful and pre-emptive.|
PG| ***** 273 ***** |


AT|

Those of you who play DONT might argue that since a 2C DONT bid shows clubs and another suit (which could be diamonds), there is no need to play 2N as unusual over a strong NT. However, just like 3-level DONT bid (e.g. 1N-3D) shows a long suit (despite the fact that you can make a DONT double with a 1 -suited hand), playing 2N as unusual even if you play DONT is useful as a pre-emptive tactic. |
PG| ***** 274 ***** |


AT|

A similar situation is 1N-P-2x-2N. That also is unusual. Since the 2x bid is always artificial (Stayman or a transfer), then 2N is unusual. Over a 2C, 2D, or 2H response to 1N, which show major suits, 2N shows 5/5 in the minors. Over 1N-P-2S-?, you need to be more careful. If the opponents are playing 4-way transfers, which means 2S definitely shows clubs, then 2N shows hearts and diamonds. However, if 2S is a transfer to either minor, then it makes no sense for 2N to show both minors, since you know you are getting a very bad break in at least one of your suits. The simplest solution is to play that 2N over such a 2S bid does not exist. Alternatively, you could play that it shows 5/5 in the majors, but my guess is partner will forget that so it is not worth the risk.|

With two-suited hands in the 10 to 15 points category you should overcall the higher ranking suit. You may get to bid your other suit later. For whatever reasons most partnerships play "Mini"/"Maxi" system.|
PG| ***** 292 ***** |


AT| 

The conventional wisdom also has it that the 5-5 or better distribution is very important rule that should not be ignored. I have read, "Do not bid UNT with either a 5-4 or 4-6 distribution. At best it can confuse our partner and at worst it can give you a minus in the range of 800 and higher." This is very true in UNT as partner is forced to bid at the three level. Nevertheless, some experts may not agree. On the other hand 6-5 hands are acceptable for UNT bids.|

Alvin Roth has a very good point when he reminds us do before making an UNT bid, "The Unusual Notrump has one thing in common with natural Notrump openings and direct 1NT overcalls. With normal 5-5 or even 6-5 patterns, you do not have to bid again to confirm your fine distribution and playing strength." |
PG| ***** 312 ***** |


NT|
"Partner heard you the first time. If he permits the opponents to play the hand in spite of your bid, do not overrule him; he is in a far better position to judge how far your side should compete than you are. The exceptions are when you are 6-6 in your two suits or when you have the strong Unusual Notrump hand. Raise his bid on the former and cue bid on the latter."|

AT|

UNT is a good example. Earlier the minimum HCP needed to make an UNT was mentioned. However, before I share a quote from Bridge Guys with you let me tell you what I like to do before making an UNT. We have seen most of what I will be telling you in the guidelines but it is worth repeating.|
PG| ***** 315 ***** |


AT|

Before I make an UNT bid I carefully look at the vulnerability, my position in the bidding cycle, the progress of the bidding, the quality of my lower suits - of course 5-5 is a must at my level - ,expertise of my partner, and finally what day of the week it is. Then and only then I consider making an UNT bid if the hand has 6 HCP plus. Why 6 HCP you may ask. Because most of my sources mentioned that number. Now let me get the quote.|
PG| ***** 316 ***** |


AT|

"Any 2 Notrump bid immediately after an opening of a Major suit by the opponents signifies that the 2 Notrump bidder holds at least 5-5 distribution, at unfavorable vulnerability, in both Minor suits, or at least 5-4 distribution at favorable vulnerability in both Minor Suits. The point range should be 6 high card points plus, and should be mainly in the suits indicated. Remember that the distribution will be your main weapon. Also, the number of Losing Tricks may be the determining factor."|

One important point should also enter in the analysis before responding. In most instances partner has made an unusual 2NT bid as a pre-emptive or as an obstructive bid. With all considered - outlined above - responder should choose one of the known suits as the trump and make a further obstructive bid by jumping in that suit. Occasionally responder may look for a game or even slam contract with an excellent fit. But don't push it.|

5C is the best bid for South. Let us look at all the reasons to bid 5C. South has a nice fit in clubs and some help in hearts, but not many high cards so not much defense against a spade or diamond contract by the opponents.|

mb|D|sk|n|lb|*bWhat would be a reasonable bid by North?^^4c|mb|4C|NT|^B@2
With an excellent fit in clubs and a partial fit in diamonds, North should be willing to compete in clubs. Based on the Law of Total Tricks, North should be willing to go to at least the four level even with unfavorable vulnerability. However, he can make a more aggressive bid of 5C particularly with favorable vulnerability. This could pressure East/West to overbid and go down.|
PG| ***** 395 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
North/South fare fine in a club contract - making 10 or 11 tricks.|
PG| ***** 396 ***** |


AT| Let us give East/West random hands as shown now|MD|0,st983 hkjt6 dkt2 cq6,0,saqj2 haq9854 d93c5|mb|4hppp|AT| and see how would they do in 4@H contract.|
pg| ***** 397 ***** |


pf|y|at| You can play this hand double dummy if you wish. You also can make other random hands for East/West. Most likely they should take at least 10 tricks in a heart contract.|
PG| ***** 398 ***** |


AT| Because, in this hand East/West most likely bid on and reach 4@H which makes, therefore, an initial 5C by North would be a more obstructive bid.|

Now let us make North bid 5C|ub|5|mb|5cppp|at| and see how would they do in 5C contract. Again you can play this hand double dummy. But make sure you do not click the forward arrow. With existing distribution 5C most likely is down 1. However exchange the @DK with one of East diamonds and 5C will make with a finesse in diamonds.|

North's options are 3H, 3NT, 5C, and 5D. None of these is perfect.|
PG| ***** 404 ***** |


AT| 3NT is practical as it is much easier to make 9 tricks than 11.|
PG| ***** 405 ***** |


sk||AT| However, considering that the 2NT is usually made with a "mini" hand the stronger hand would be the dummy. A lead of either major by West could be problematic.|

The bidding is as shown above. On the first round South decided against overcalling (unfavorable vulnerability and not knowing how West would bid are good reasons).|
PG| ***** 410 ***** |


lb|*yShould South bid now^^Y|NT|^B@2
The answer is a qualified "Yes." Now South is in the balancing position with 9 HCP, East/West have stopped at the two level, North probably has some of the missing strength.|

lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^2N|mb|2N|NT|^B@2
2NT by South is unusual in the pass out position even though he didn't jump to 2NT on the first round. Partner should remember what Bergen says, "It is unusual if it is reasonable to be unusual." South cannot be expected to have much strength to bid a natural 2NT.|

PG| ***** 422 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts play the following. Double of 4S is takeoutish, although on many hands responder can decide to pass, hoping that setting 4S will work best, especially if responder has a balanced hand. 4NT is a 2-suited takeout with 5/5, but not necessarily the minors. The 4N bidder could be 5/5 in C/D, C/H, or D/H. Therefore, responder should never bid 5H, and only bid 5D if he is willing to play 5H if partner is 5/5 in C/H. You can decide whether or not to put this in the movie. (I play this, btw, and it has worked well and does come up frequently enough that it is worth playing, unlike the lottery, lol).|

South can bid either 2N or 4N-depending on his partner and vulnerability. 4N is a more pre-emptive, more obstructive, cleaner bid and reflects the hand better. It quickly takes partnership to either 5C or 5D where they belong. BTW, in this position 1N overcall by South is natural showing a balanced hand showing 15 to 18 points.|

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals.

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |

%%%Rule 15
qx|R15, Rule 15|tu||HT|c|cs|1|cp|4|fp|2|AT|^-{      Rule 15      }
^-|CP||FP||CS||ht|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those not familiar with the rule of 15, it works as follows. If your HCP plus spades are 15 or more, you should open in 4th seat. For example, you would open a 10 HCP hand with 5 spades (10 + 5 = 15) or an 11 HCP hand with 4 spades. The idea here is, particularly with weaker openings, this gives you some protection of the opponents not being to out compete you in spades.|
PG| ***** 459 ***** |


AT|

I am not a big fan of the rule of 15. I don't think it has a sound theoretical basis. My style is to open hands in 4th seat that meet the rule of 20, regardless of my spade holding, and not open hands that do not meet the rule of 20. If I have a marginal rule of 20 opener with weak majors, very occasionally I might choose to pass for tactical reasons (especially if I am vul and they are not) -- the opponents might outbid me in a major. But that is rare -- as you know, I hate to pass. :)|
PG| ***** 460 ***** |


AT|

And if you choose to play the rule of 15, I suggest you still open all rule of 20 hands. For example, if I had a spade void, I certainly would open any hands with 11-14 HCP even though they do not meet the rule of 15.|
