^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally play Bergen Raises (Reverse) over takeout doubles, so 3C would be my 4-card limit(+) raise. Therefore, since I no longer need 2N as a 4-card raise, I play 2N as a 3-card raise. However, absent the agreement to play Bergen over a takeout double (and that agreement is very non-standard), virtually every expert plays 2N guarantees 4-card support.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Joan wanted to be aggressive, a raise to 4H is not unreasonable. But, an important bidding principle is, once you have described your hand, you should not describe it again. Boater said  she had 10-12 points with 4 hearts. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|TJ said "TY I wish to play 3H now." So unless Boater had a very good reason to bid on, she should pass. she told her story, partner made her decision, right or wrong.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, had TJ made a game try by bidding 3C or 3D, then Boater should bid 4H because then TJ is asking if Boater is closer to the top of her range. And since Boater is, she should bid 4H. But once TJ decides 3H is where to play, Boater has nothing more to add.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie did well in defense. Unfortunately, the heart suit broke luckily for Boater. But if I had the @H9 instead of Boater, we get an extra  trick. The spades also broke luckily for her. However, she should not have lost a diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main point on this hand is to use DONT when you have the appropriate distribution, even without that many HCP. The idea is to push the opponents out of 1NT, which is very hard to defend against. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea behind DONT is not for you to find a game, which you rarely can make once an opponent opens 15-17 NT. It is for you to obstruct the opponents. So you partner should not punish you by raising, unless they are very distributional.|

PG| ***** 80 ***** |


HT|c|at|^n{|ia|,1d1h|at|}|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


HT|f|va|5|AT|^b@2On the above auctions only, you can differentiate between having 4 spades and 5 spades.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


ht|h|at|^BIf it goes,|HT|h|at|^d{|ia|,1d1h1S|at|}|HT|h|AT|^o@2 that promises 5+ spades. It is also true had North bid 1@C  as shown above above left.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


ht|l|at|^BIf it goes,|HT|l|at|^d{|ia|,1d1hX|at|}|HT|l|at|^o@2 (negative) that shows exactly 4 spades. But that is the only auction where that is true. The answer is the same had North opened 1@C as shown above left.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


ht|p|at|^BIf for example, it goes,|HT|p|cp|4|cs|1|at|^g{|ia|,1C!1d1S|at|}|HT|p|cp||at|^r@2 the 1S bid can be made with as few as 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


ht|t|AT|^BOr if it goes,|HT|t|at|^g{|ia|,1C!1h1S|at|}|HT|t|cs||cp||at|^r@2 the 1S promises 5+ spades.|
HT|w|va|5|at|^B@2And in fact, after my double, it is quite likely we have an 8-card spade fit. So with her 10 points and 4 spades, TJ can and should bid 2S to "raise" my spades and show a good hand.|

athni: Your dbl can be for both majors also.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2H by Bonnie is NOT a reverse. It would only be a reverse if Bonnie could bid 2C. If you voluntarily bypass your first suit-which was available to you-to bid a higher suit, that is a reverse. Let me change the bidding to show the case.|

PG| ***** 93 ***** |


at| On this auction, 2C is available for Bonnie to bid, and it was bypassed. Thus, 2H is a reverse. However,|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


ub|5|AT| on the original auction,|MB|1c1s2dp2h|at| 2C is not available, so Bonnie is not voluntarily bypassing it by raising the level of the auction.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, if she wanted to bid clubs she would have to bid 3C. So since she cannot bid 2C, 2H is no longer a reverse.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea behind a reverse is, pard only promises 6 points with a 1-level bid. So if you are forcing pard to return to your suit at the 3-level (e.g. 1C-P-1S-P-2H-P-3C) you should have a strong hand. On this auction, 2D promises 10+ so the partnership should be safe at the 3 level.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why, in fact, some SAYC players play that 1D-P-2C-P-2H is NOT a reverse (although when I play SAYC I play it is a reverse) because since pard showed 10+ with 2C, the 3-level is safe.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |

princesess: Could West bid 2N over 2D showing a spade stopper?|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, if she were stuck for a bid. She probably has a spade stopper and pard did not negative double, so probably does not have hearts. Therefore, I think both 2H and 2N are reasonable calls by Bonnie.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Boater, has a problem. She has enough points to force to game but she only has 1 spade stopper, and is short in spades, meaning she can't hold up. So, unless either they have 9 tricks off the top, or Bonnie also has a spade stopper, 3N is in danger.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, playing 2NT, especially in IMPs, is not usually a winning result. And there is no reason to think that if 3N is going down, 2N is not going down. So, should Boater decide to bid NT, as she did, she might as well bid 3N because it has much greater reward, and is not all that risky compared to 2N.|

But once we find a heart fit, you can add extra length points for 6+ trumps. So, in addition to the 3 original length points I am entitled to 2 more length points because of the fit, for a total of 5. It may sound like "double counting" but I have found it is quite accurate.|

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - I understand DONT stands for (D)isturb (O)pponents (N)o (T)rump and Marty Bergen is the author. Please explain it and tell us when is it used?|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|DONT should be used when you have a hand suitable for competing over a 1N opener. I will discuss the exact requirements later. But, in general, if your hand is either somewhat distributional or has some strength, you should compete by making a DONT bid.
|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Is it correct that DONT is really to disturb and get a part score rather than trying for a game or higher auctions?|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, the purpose of DONT is to arrive at the best part score. In general, once an opponent opens a strong NT, it is unlikely your side has game. So, DONT is designed to get you to a good part score. You may occasionally miss a game, but this is more than made up by the many successful part scores you will find if you play DONT.
|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - There are other conventions to disturb a 1NT opener beside DONT such as Astro, Pinpoint, Brozel, Modified Brozel, Hamilton, Cappiletti and Modified Cappiletti. You do prefer DONT. What is your reasoning? |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer DONT because it allows you to compete on more hand types and find a good part score at the 2 level. Most of these other conventions often require stronger hands to compete because you may often end up at the 3 level, so you will have to pass with many hands that, were you playing DONT, you would be able to compete with.

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Another good teacher opines that the auction of 1NT-P-P-P is difficult to successfully defend and the intention for opponent should be to push them out of 1NT auction. What are your thoughts on the issue please?|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with the other teacher that more often than not, you will not get a good score if the auction goes 1N-P-P-P. At best, you are unlikely to beat 1N more than a trick or two, and if you can beat it, you probably can make a part score of your own. And, they will often make 1N, and you will still have a part score contract that you could have made instead.|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Is it true that DONT is really more so based on shape rather the points of the hand? I will ask specifics later.|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|The more distribution you have, the fewer points you need to bid DONT. And, because the NT opener has a good hand, on average you will hold fewer points. So, because of that, you will tend to compete more often with DONT based on distribution than high cards.
|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Now then, my RHO opens 1NT. What should I look for in my hand to correctly bid a DONT. Now, you can be specific with shape and point range please.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at single suited hands first. You should bid DONT if you have the same sort of hand that you would be willing to overcall with a suit at the 2 level had the opponent opened a suit at the one level. So, you need either a six card suit, or a good five card suit, and typically at least ten or so points (using Bergen hand evaluation methods).|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


AT|

With a 2 suited hand, it is a bit more complicated. With 5/5, you can compete with as few as 7 or 8 HCP, particularly if your values are concentrated in your suits. With 5/4, you probably should have at least 10 or 11 HCP. Lately, I almost never bid DONT in direct seat with only 4-4 and will only bid DONT in balancing seat with 4-4 if I have close to an opener and my 2 suits are very good (each have at least 2 honors).|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


AT|

Also, you should be a bit more cautious when you are vulnerable, and can be a bit more aggressive when non-vulnerable.|

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Now, I like to concentrate on each part of DONT one at a time. From your explanation I understand that I should show all single suited hands with the DONT double except when the holding is a weak spade. Before I ask you what a single suit is what if beside having a single suit the hand contains 4+card side suit?|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|In general, if you have a six card suit, you are normally better playing in that suit. So, if you have a hand with both six card and 4 card suits, I would tend to treat that as a single suited hand. rather than a 2 suited hand.
|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Thank you. Back to the single suit issue. I understand that the longer the single suit is the less points is needed to bid a DONT double, Therefore, I have the following hypothetical single suits which I need help on point requirement. What would it take for each of the following to bid a DONT double.
- A. a five + cards with no  4+ card side suit.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned previously, you should bid a DONT double (single suit) if you have the same sort of hand that you would be willing to overcall with a suit at the 2 level had the opponent opened a suit at the one level.

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| and - B. A six or seven card suit. I am sure an eight or nine is possible but for now just the six and seven would do.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|With a six card suit, you should be willing to compete with as little as 7 or 8 points. With a seven card suit, even 5 or 6 points can be enough. However, if you have fewer points, your high cards should be concentrated in your long suit.|

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Now to the two suited hands. Again, I understand that the point requirement for a 6-6 is less that 4-5. First, please give a few examples of two suited hands and define your point range.|

pg| ***** 195 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Let me clear one important point before we go to other parts. From your instructions, I understand that we always bid the lower ranking of the two suits regardless of the the shape or the strength of each two suits. For example with 2-2-5-4 or a 2-5-2-4 or a 5-2-2-4 the  bid always is 2@C. Is that correct?|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned, you should usually treat a hand with one four card suit and one 6+ card suit as a single suited hand. On any hand that you choose to treat as 2 suited, DONT requires that you bid your lower ranking suit, even if your higher ranking suit is stronger. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Let us shift to partner's response after a DONT bid assuming the next opponent simply passes. Please, tell us what would be partner's response if the auction goes 1NT-D-P ?|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|Over a DONT double (showing a single suited hand), the doubler's partner must bid 2@C. This allows the doubler to bid their suit at the 2 level (or pass if their suit is clubs).|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Thank you. Now if the auction is 1NT-2@C-P ?|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|When the DONT bidder bids a suit, showing a 2 suited hand, partner should pass with 3+ card support. Otherwise, partner should bid the next higher suit, to allow the DONT bidder to pass if that is their 2nd suit or to bid their other suit at the 2 level. In the example auction you gave, partner should pass with 3+ clubs, otherwise bid 2@D.

It is more likely that you will be better off in your suit than partner's suit. So, partner should not have complained on that particular hand. |

HT|t|cp|8|AT|^c@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, you can have as little as 4/4 and show 2 suits if you have an opening hand or better. Second of all, in general, you should bid 2@S rather than doubling and bidding 2@S. As originally defined, Bergen said 2@S directly was weaker than doubling and bidding 2@S, but I feel the preemptive value of bidding 2@S right away is such that you should always bid 2S when you have spades.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


AT|

In fact, I play a revised version of DONT. I play 2@H shows a single suited heart hand, rather than hearts and spades. That is because I feel that are more hands where you have a single suited heart hand than a 2 suited heart/spade hand. And 2@H has good preemptive value. Playing this revised version of DONT, to show hearts and spades, you double and correct 2@C to 2@H.|

^B@2South overcalls 2@C to show a 2-suited hand.  North does not have 3+ card support in clubs, so must bid the next higher suit (2@D in this case) to allow South to show the second suit. (South will pass if diamonds is the 2nd suit.) However, heart is second suit for South. Playing DONT, with a 2-suiter, bid the lower of your suits.  This way you can usually find a fit at the 2-level.

^B@2Since double would show a single-suited hand, North can't show the strong balanced hand.  He just has to pass.  However, that's not usually a disaster.  When someone opens a strong No-Trump, it's very rare to have a strong hand, and even if you do have, passing usually works out OK.

I do not agree with the original definition where you bid 2@S with a weak hand, and double and correct to 2S with a stronger hand. I think you should always just bid 2@S if you have spades.|

^B@2After a DONT bid, the partnership often has to "scramble" to find the best fit at the 2-level.  Here, responder could bid 2D (pass/correct).  That would work out well if South had the minors.  But South will bid 2S - disaster!  It pays to be ^*ipessimistic^*n and assume partner has the suits you are short in.  Best is for North to bid 2H, natural and not forcing.

^*bAfter a DONT bid, a new suit (not the next step) is natural and non-forcing.^*n|

nt|When the auction starts 1NT - Pass - Pass, it pays to bid as often as you can if you're unbalanced.  Playing DONT, that's even more true.  Firstly, partner will probably be balanced (he didn't overcall himself!) so he should have a fit for you somewhere.  Secondly, he will often be quite strong (he couldn't double for penalties, remember).  So even if you are weak, don't be scared - bid!

^*bAfter 1NT - Pass - Pass, try to bid with almost any unbalanced hand.^*n|

PG| ***** 277 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Do not agree that West should bid 2N with a strong hand. Sure, on this hand it works out well, but more often partner will have a weaker hand, and you will get too high. Remember, DONT is designed to find a good 2 level part score; it is very rare in real life that you will miss a game, and your plusses for the part scores will more than make up for that small disadvantage.|

^B@2An immediate 3@H overcall is weak with a long suit.  So by doubling THEN going to the 3-level, West shows a strong hand.  East should raise.

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
