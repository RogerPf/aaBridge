^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some might open this light in 3rd seat, but I do not like to open light, The theory of opening  light is that it is likely, after 2 passes, if you have less than an opener, 4th seat has an opener, and opening light lets you get into the auction early. But I have found, for me, the minuses of pard not knowing if you really have an opener, outweigh the plusses.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, on this original hand Boater has a minimum with 3-card support, and answers choice b) by bidding 3@H. For Bonnie it is close between pass and 4H. Using Bergen, she has 8 HCP. Subtract 1 for @SQ singleton. Subtract 1 for 3 quacks and no A or 10 for a total of 6.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I know although on this hand Bonnie will be dummy, she actually evaluates her hand as if she is declarer. This is a subtle part of Bergen evaluation that most people don't know. What Bergen means by "dummy points" is "dummy" is the person with the shorter trump.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On most hands, that is indeed the person who will actually be dummy. However, on transfer hands, it turns out that the person who will be declarer has the shorter trumps, so, for the purpose of hand evaluation, they must count dummy points.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, similarly, the person who is dummy has the longer trumps, so evaluates as if they were declarer. One way to think of that is "count dummy points if you have the shorter trumps" BUT "count declarer points if you have the longer trumps." That is really what Bergen intended. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So Bonnie counts declarer points. To her original 6 she adds 1 for 5 hearts, adds 2 for singleton, and adds 1 for side club suit for a total of 10. As Boater only bid 3H, showing 15 or 16, that means they have 25 or 26. So Bonnie does not have a clear cut choice.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think pass is slightly better, due to her quacks and bad heart suit, and only an 8-card fit but 4H is certainly not crazy and could work well. I pass because one of my bidding rules is to be conservative with an 8-card fit, aggressive with a 9-card fit. And since Boater did not super accept (jump to 3H over 2D), they have an 8 card fit. For that reason I would pass, but I would be worried about missing 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a hard hand to play. And again demonstrates that 8-card fits are often a problem when in a close game. I don't fault the bidding at all. Bonnie's plan of hoping for a 3-3 diamond break could result in 10 tricks. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only other alternative is to try and ruff 1 diamond in dummy. So with the @DK, play to the @DA, and try to ruff a diamond. That will work if diamonds are 3-3 or  spades are 3-2. But on this hand I ruff the 3rd diamond with the S6, Bonnie must over ruff with the @SQ, and TJ ends up with a spade trick as a result. So the hand cannot be made.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again an unlucky hand for Bonnie. 2C was a very reasonable bid with her nice 6 card suit. One comment on TJ  opening 1S. Some might think it does not meet the rule of 20, and hence is not an opener. But if you use what are known as Bergen "adjusted HCP", it does meet the rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For purposes of the rule of 20, Bergen recommends you count HCP using all his starting point rules except length. So, since TJ has a quality spade suit (3 honors) she has 10 raw HCP + 1 for quality suit = 11 adjusted HCP. And 11 + 9 cards in spades and diamonds = 20. So it was ok to open. Further, although Bergen does not give any extra points for it, 5-4-3-1 is nice distribution.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Any hands with singletons or voids can be upgraded. Therefore, 1S does meet the criteria, although if TJ  chose to pass, that would be ok.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying easy to bid, but 3S is a huge underbid. Another possible bid by TJ is 4C. That shows 20 points, 4 spades and a singleton or void in clubs. It is a splinter. Bonnie has a bad club holding opposite shortness and would bid 4S.|

BTW, Bonnie made an expert play at trick 1 by pitching a heart from dummy. That is called a "loser on loser." She threw away a heart loser, and established her @CK.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Bonnie. It turns out because diamonds are 3-3 and spades are 2-2, 6 can make. But that is about a 10% probability, and Bonnie is only in 4. So her line of play was excellent, guarantees 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets talk about the bidding, interesting and hard hand to bid. I think most of you would do the same through 3S. I am sure most of you would be afraid to bid 4D however. But Bonnie was just following the law of total tricks. I promise 7 diamonds and she has 3. So 4D is a lawful bid. It does turn out that 4D goes down 2.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is very hard for the opponents to double with 3 low trump and we pushed them into 4S. As I always say, use the law to determine how high to bid. It works well almost all the time, and even when it does not, the opponents often take an extra push, particularly when your side has 10+ trumps.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What about Boater. I think she has a clear pass. She has a minish opener, with flat distribution. She described her hand when she bid 1S. She has nothing extra. If for example, she had diamond shortness, then she might bid 4S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming Boater passes, what should TJ do?|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT| That is a more interesting question. TJ  has 8 HCP, 1 quality suit point, 1 length point and 2 points for the singleton diamond. The singleton diamond, in particular is very useful. So I think 4S is warranted.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Two students happened to write to me this week about what to do when so-called experts publicly criticize their bridge. I suspect this is a problem that many students encounter from time to time. Here is what I wrote back:|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|

My best advice is to ignore them, hard as that may be. Unsolicited advice, particularly in public, is very discourteous, and my number 1 rule in selecting people to play with is that they MUST be courteous. It is ok to discuss a hand in a non-accusatory way, but, even if someone thinks you made a mistake, it is not appropriate to belittle you in any way. And most of the time these people don't know what they are talking about. If you think they might have a legitimate point and you are wondering about it, then feel free to ask me or anyone else whose opinion you value, but don't waste your time arguing with them.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

Here is a story of what happened to me at a live club. I am sometimes asked to fill in when there is an odd person who needs a partner. On this particular occasion, I was playing with someone who, having played against her before, I thought was reasonably good. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT|

However, the auction went 1C-P-1S-P-2H by her. Now naturally I thought she had a reverse. But it turned out that she had a balanced 19 HCP with 4 hearts and 3 clubs, so her correct call was 2N. We ended up in 6C in a 4-3- fit, (I had 4 clubs and a good hand.) I didn't say anything after the hand until she told me my 6C bid was "stupid" because she might only have 3 clubs. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT|

Now remember, I am a pickup partner doing her a favor. Even then, although of course I was annoyed, all I said was that most people play that when they reverse they promise 5+ in their first suit, so we had a misunderstanding. She said I didn't know what I was talking about. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


AT|

The real point I am trying to make is notice the appropriate tone I used in discussing the hand vs. the inappropriate way she discussed the hand.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
