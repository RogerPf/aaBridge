^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although Bonnie has enough points to bid, she has no good bid available. Some would make a takeout double, but that is not a good idea. You are promising  at least 3 cards in the unbid suits, probably at least 4-3 in the majors usually. Just because you have a balanced opening hand, it does not mean you should make a takeout double. You should to at least have support for the unbid majors, and should have 3+ in the unbid minor.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Occasionally, if I am 4-4 in the majors and have only 2 in the unbid minor, I will "cross my fingers" and double, lol. But I will never double with a doubleton in an unbid major unless I plan to double and correct with a strong hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a tough situation where it is possible to lose a 4-4 heart fit. But I am not quite strong enough to bid 2H, particularly with a singleton diamond.If I had the same points with 3 diamonds and 1 club, then I could bid 2H because I could always return to 3D if need be. However, with shortness in diamonds, and partner usually promising a good 5+ card suit (often more) with her bid, I will pass. When you think there is a misfit, best to quit ASAP.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, there is little likelihood we have game, as TJ shows a min opener. Therefore, pass will work out best most often.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Both the defense and declarer could have done better. I discussed the lead and the second trick play by East. As to TJ charmed Bonnie into setting up spades for you, lol, she need to take advantage of the gifts. Draw trump, all 4 rounds-not sure why you stopped. Then lead a heart to the HA, play spades pitching your clubs, and lose a heart, making 5.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once spades are set TJ makes 5. Even if the heart finesse wins, you still make 5.|

tjtoo: If the heart Queen had won, I would have played the spade. But finessing let them in with clubs. Should have gone for the heart Ace as you suggested.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So don't bother, and you should be willing to trade eliminating 3 club losers for a 50% chance of maybe eliminating a heart loser. Best to look at the whole hand, not just one suit at a time.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
kat827:  On the ACBL convention card, it has a section on leads that says from AKx you lead K (in a suit contract).  Although I lead the Ace as was done here from that holding, why does it say that on the card? |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days most people lead Ace from Ace-King. If you look carefully on the card, A is marked as the standard lead. Must be an old card I just looked, neither is bold on the official ACBL card. Anyway, although I prefer K from A, A from AK is definitely the standard these days.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I made extra trick. Had Bonnie ruffed low, she would get one more trick. Notice, I kept track of all 4 suits. I know that is hard. many people only keep track of trump. But I suggest you "stretch" your concentration and keep track of trump and your next best suit at least when you are declaring. And that means not only the high cards, but how many remain in the defensive hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have been keeping track, and know there are 3 diamonds still out. The way I keep track is as follows:
I started with 6, which means the opponents started with 7. So I keep track of how many they still have left. After the first diamond trick, they have 5 left. And after the 2nd diamond trick they have 3 left. I strongly recommend you count out suits that way -- keeping track of what the opponents have left, as opposed to how many have been played. I think you will find that method much easier.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a case where TJ should not draw trump right away. She should play another diamond at trick 2 to make sure dummy still has a trump to ruff a diamond. It is often right to draw trump first. However, the most common reason not to draw trump as illustrated in this hand is because you want to ruff something before dummy is out of trump. So the point of that hand was to delay drawing trump until after ruffing a diamond.|

Bored, tired of losing badly at bridge resulting in banishment to porcupine land, tired of arthritis pain, and tired of the political advertisements in mid October, 2012, I took my Son's offer to meet him in Helena, Montana. To get there, I took a short flight from San Diego to Salt Lake City. There, I rented a car and began my drive. From Helena, we went to Great Falls, Livingston, Gallatin National Forest,  Chico Hot Springs, Gardiner,  Bozeman, Butte, and Missoula. Then I made the return trip to  Idaho Falls and  Pocatello in Idaho and back to Salt Lake City to catch the return flight back to San Diego.|

Montana is a great state. Visit it if you get a chance. The 360 degree horizon is miles away. Anywhere in that state you feel that you are looking at your surroundings from a mile elevation--in many areas you are at a much higher elevation anyhow. While driving the beautiful and scenic Interstate -15 and interstate 90 I wondered what if I had migrated to the new world in early seventeenth century. The thought made me curious on life in the new world during the Colonial Period.|

It is a great book because as mentioned by the authors in the preface , " We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration." And that is what interested me the most. I have been reading and listening to the audio portion ever since and I will read it all and often. My main curiosity was the Colonial Period in the US and next you will read the SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD from the book. Reading it made me realize how lucky I am. Please send me a note if you are interested in the subject. |

HT|b|cs|1|cp|4|fp|3|at|^-{    SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD    }
^-|CP||FP||at|In the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763 - a period of a century and a half - a new nation was being prepared on this continent to take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of migration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and nationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical importance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot were also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands of negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as domestic servants in the North.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


AT|

Why did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims and Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and Irish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments that denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of their consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in the Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the negroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of adventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the enterprising merchants.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


AT|

How did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together and borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other cases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it was the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who undertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their own way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years in exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account of the profits derived from their sale as slaves.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


AT|

Whatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get across the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down forests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches, schools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and wove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and traded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of commerce - Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line they pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they were already on the crest of the Alleghanies. [^*Ithe exact spelling from the book.]|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


AT|^*N]

Though they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast, the colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major portion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the literature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the colonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a wilderness. |

HT|b|cs|1|cp|4|fp|3|at|^-{    SUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD - Continued   }
^-|CP||FP||at|To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by necessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and later against the French. They were all subjects of the same sovereign - the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for them and the English government supervised their local affairs, their trade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common grievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


AT|

Many of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw them into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them were freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled it with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom. The majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the Church of England, that staunch defender of the British monarchy. Each colony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it grew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a people learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to strengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of colonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence which they were designed to quench.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


AT|

Nevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the assistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection of the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from wiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were controlled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed great advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the earth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and merchandise. |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


AT|

It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages which the colonists suffered through British regulation of their industry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed. Still that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is not necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A thousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation, to inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a destiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British empire. |

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
