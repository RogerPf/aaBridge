^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When pard overcalls 1N, you still play Stayman and transfers. Some people refer to this as "front of card" in live bridge. What that means is an ACBL convention card has a front and a back. The 1NT overcall description is on the back but what you play over 1NT is on the front. So people say, even though the 1NT overcall is on the back, they play the same system that is on the "front of card."|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand and interesting event. So remember, when pard overcalls 1N, bid just the same as if she opened 1N. A 1N overcall shows 15-18 not 15-17, so you can be a tad more aggressive in inviting. Joan does not have a good bid over 1D. Double would result in my bidding spades, which really is bad. So, the best she can do is show her point count and diamond stopper with an imperfect 1N. Her  other choice is 1H but I think 1N is better.|

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes that is called a "reopening double." It is meant as takeout, but pard has the option of passing. Negative doubles are a very nice convention. But every once in a while pard wants to but cannot make a penalty double of the overcall. So you as opener should protect against that when you can.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main point of this hand was the reopening double. Always keep in mind that pard occasionally has a penalty double. So when you are short in the overcalled suit (2 or fewer) strain to reopen with a double. With 3 or more in the overcalled suit, however, it is unlikely there is a penalty double by pard. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|A few players might open this 1N, as it is otherwise hard to show your values with 15-17 HCP. But this has two flaws. You do not have the appropriate distribution (two doubletons). And you suppress your five card major. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The problem is what to bid if partner responds 1NT. Playing SAYC (1NT not forcing), I would pass, as game is unlikely. Playing 2/1 with forcing 1NT you should bid 2C. This is the one distribution where you rebid a 2-card club suit over a forcing NT.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Although the negative double only promises 4 spades, it can also be used on a hand where you are not strong enough to bid 2S but have 5+ spades. If you have a very good spade suit, you can "negative double and correct" (e.g bid 2S if partner rebids 2H). |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Unlike a takeout double and correct which shows a strong hand , a negative double and correct shows a hand too weak to bid 2S directly. On this particular hand, if partner rebids 2H, East can rebid 3C which shows a weak hand with 5+ clubs and at least 4 spades.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|With a very nice hand (15 HCP, 1 length point, 2 points for the doubletons = 18 dummy points) East has a clear 3S bid. In fact, 4S would be aggressive but reasonable.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


mb|p|sk|e|NT||lb|*bWhat should East bid now?^^4s|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Once partner bids 3S over 3D, East can calculate his Bergen declarer points. Even though West will be the actual declarer,  East should count declarer points (and West should count dummy points). East actually bid "spades" first by making a negative double, so East is logically the declarer.  |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|East has 6 HCP, 2 length points, 2 points for the singleton, and 1 point for the side club suit for a total of 10. West should have some extra values for bidding 3S, close to a medium hand at least. So the combined point total for E/W should be 26 or at least close to that. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, East knows they have a 9-card fit, and you should stretch to bid close games with a 9-card fit (and be more conservative with only an 8-card fit). The only negative is the red suit distribution -- a doubleton heart and a singleton diamond would be better (given EW bid hearts and NS bid diamonds), but 4S is still a good bid.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a gem so you never forget to play "front of card." |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


at|

I heard "front of card" from Howard many times but could not find a printed convention card with such information on its front or on its back. The ACBL convention card is a one page printed form where you fill in the conventions you play in the front and keep track of scores on the back. Both sides have a vertical line in the middle so you can fold the form in half and keep it in special holder with a pencil. Most bridge players take pride keeping them tidy.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


AT|

I was embarrassed asking Howard where is the back and where is the front. But on a recent trip to the local club finally I asked the tournament director where was the ACBL convention card's front or back as I could not find the information Howard was referring to. Then I saw a devilish smile on his face while picking up an ACBL convention card. He folded it along the vertical line and said, "Now you have a front and a back." Turning the folded paper back and forth. Movie Maker's face was red for a long time. |

Now, I am sure, you never forget to play "front of card" when your partner overcalls 1N. Spreading our mentor's message is an endeavor for Movie Maker without bounds :).|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
