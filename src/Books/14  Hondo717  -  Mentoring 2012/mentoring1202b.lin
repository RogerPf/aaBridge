^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again this hand illustrates that it is important on both offense and defense to count out the suits. Once I show up with one heart, Noi should realize Pam started with two and file that away in case it is important. And Pam should realize, because I opened 2D, Noi started with 2 diamonds. Sometimes this information makes no difference, but often it does, and if you get in the habit of automatically filing these things in your head, it really helps.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other thing I want to comment on is Pam's ruffing of a diamond at trick 2. In this case, her plan is to set up dummy. There really is no reason to ruff diamonds, because the long trumps are in dummy. So, assuming hearts break, she can count six hearts, 1 spade, 1 diamond, and 1 club for sure.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |

onoway: I was trying to get to the board to use the @C.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can just play ace and another heart to get to board, no reason to ruff a diamond. You unnecessarily used up a trump that way. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now back to the plan. If hearts break, she needs one extra trick in the black suits. If Noi, has the Q of clubs, that is one possibility. However, once hearts don't break, she needs two extra tricks--needs an extra spade. And the easiest thing to do is play me for the K of spades. So lead a low spade towards the Q. But when that doesn't work, then you have to hope Noi also has the J of spades, so lead low towards your A10, Therefore, playing the 10 of spades right away was incorrect, because it took away one of your options. The idea is to keep as many options open as possible.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, mostly I want to discuss the bidding, but let me make a brief comment about how best to play the heart suit. Basically, the easiest way to play the suit is to hope Betty has the K of hearts. if that is true, you lose one heart. So, the best play is low to the A and low back towards the Q. In this case there happens to be another unlikely distribution that means you only lose one heart trick as well. Because, Betty has J10 doubleton, your 9 sets up. an added bonus :) The reason to play the heart suit as I suggested is that it is your best hope for only one heart loser if Betty has the King.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, to the bidding. Betty should raise clubs right away. Given the vulnerability, I think she should bid 3@C. In general, although partner is only promising 3 clubs, 80% of the time, they will have 4 or more. So, Betty can bid 3C on the first round, confident that most of the time she will be in a 9 card fit.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, it is not an inverted minor.  Inverted Minors is off after intervention. 2C is still a weak bid over the double. If you play Jordan 2N, 2N would show a limit raise with 4+ clubs, so no reason to play 2C as showing a strong hand. If you don't play Jordan, a redouble is used to show your points. so, 2C over a double is always less than 10 points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was not a makeable contract, so we need to talk about the bidding. Everything through 4C was fine. However, Pam, you have a pretty minimum overcall, so there is no reason for you to bid 4D. You have no extra features, such as a singleton club, or extra points, or a really good diamond suit. So pass is pretty clear. And Betty, the same thing applies to you. You showed your limit raise. Therefore Pam and Betty should have passed. Betty has shown a limit diamond raise, and that's what she has. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, she has 4 spades, which is good on defense. Although I think it is important to be aggressive, it is also important to know when to pass. Basically, if you have shown your hand, and have no additional important feature, you can pass. In this case, both Pam and Betty have pretty much what they said they have, with nothing extra, so both should pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Darlene let me help you select a better opening lead than you had before. Always, carefully select your opening lead. Even though I raised clubs, you have a better lead than your original clubs lead. in general avoid leading unprotected Aces. Here, if you lead clubs, the Ace is right. But clubs are not right. You cannot lead spade because Jana bid spades. So by process of elimination you should lead diamonds. Here top of the honor sequence is the correct lead.|sk||
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain some opening lead theory here. First of all, generally it is not a good idea to lead unprotected aces. With Darlene's holding it is particularly dangerous to lead club Ace. Suppose for example club Ace as an opening lead and if I have the Q and Jana has the K, which is quite possible. In that case I need to lead clubs through Jana's king. Another thing to avoid is leading the opponents suits. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes a trump lead is ok, but avoid leading their suit if it is not trumps. In this case, by the process of elimination the lead is diamonds. With J109, Darlene should feel very comfortable leading the J, top of an honor sequence. Also, because of that lead, I know Jana has the @DQ of diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, we talked about the important point on this hand, which was the opening lead. The other issue was Darlene should play low quickly on the heart trick. Remember, 2nd hand low. it is rarely wrong.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, it defeated the contract, because Jana correctly finessed the 10, but had Darlene played the ace, she might have gotten the suit right. The 10 is the correct play Jana. It picks up AQx in Darlene's hand. it is only wrong on this particular distribution, which is lower percentage, and you have no way of knowing that.|

^-|ht|d|CP||FP||at|^B@2Many years ago there was a King who was powerful with vast knowledge to match his power and generosity. He took care of all his subjects who were mostly farmers. He gave them seeds to plant crops. The farmers were happy. There were plenty of food for all, The family size were large thanks to good and healthy environment--more babies being born each, year. The bulls were active and making calves frequently. All other live stocks were increasing in numbers. You can say that there was nothing to be concerned about.

Then one day the wise king was told of a new development in the neighboring kingdoms. The other Kings were giving the farmers the seed for crops which was treated with pesticides and fungicides in order to increase the crop size.

The king thought it was a great idea and adopted that policy. However,  farmers were happy and prosperous with Organic farming (the old fashion way)as they have done through many generations. Some started to question the change over.

Soon after the new policy went into effect the farmers began noticing the other side. The crop size increased but trouble started showing up everywhere. The Bulls were not interested-the number of calves dropped. The other live stocks were producing very few. The men farmers were too tired and their wives had headaches all the time. Everyone blamed all the added chemical to the seeds for their plight. 

An old farmer decided to present the problem to the King.  The other farmers tried to talk him out of doing so. "He will be dismayed and you may end up the rest of your life sleeping with the skunks old man." some warned him. The old farmer said, "The King is wise and kind. He loves his subjects and will not do such a thing."  But to be on the safe side he sent his grip to the King written on baked bricks called BBO movies.

The old farmer was right. The King in his wisdom saw the merits for both and decided henceforth he will give one half of the seed as before--organic--and the other half treated. That made many of his farmers happy. At least there were no more headaches or falling sleep early. Better yet the bulls started charging in the field. The Farmers in the adjoining kingdoms were hoping that their Kings would do the same.

Any similarity between this story from the past and recent events in BBO is purely accidental.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
