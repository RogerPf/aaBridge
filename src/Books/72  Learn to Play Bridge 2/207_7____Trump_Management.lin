The presence of a trump suit can be the declarer's best friend. There are many wonderful things that the declarer can do with a trump suit. For example, he can use the trump suit to ruff the defenders' winners, to ruff his own losers in the dummy, and to crossruff. It goes without saying that none of these techniques are available at notrump.
|n#|9|
qx|7|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


at|On the other side of the coin, the presence of a trump suit can also cause the declarer to face dangers that he would not have had in a notrump contract. For example, the defenders can sometimes ruff declarer's winners, overruff when a loser is ruffed in the dummy, or use the forcing game to threaten the declarer's trump control.
|n#|9|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|The original Learn to Play Bridge program included a good introduction to the important subject of trump management. The purpose of this chapter is to further explore some of the ways in which you can use the trump suit to win extra tricks and ways in which you can prevent the defenders from winning tricks with the trumps that they were dealt.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|^^

The material in is chapter is presented as a series of 10 deals.  

You should PLAN the play of each deal before trying to pay it against the aaBridge Bots  OR   looking at the solution that follows.

Remember  ^*b Good Trump Management ^*n  is the key to success.

The way to virtually ensure making this contract is to avoid the trap of the diamond finesse.  Instead of finessing the @DQ at trick 2, try playing a diamond to the dummy's @DA|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


pc|d2d5dad8|

Here is the key lesson point of this deal:|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^^^-{ When faced with what looks like an obvious finesse, ask yourself what will happen next if the 
 finesse loses (and also if it wins). If something could go wrong, look for an alternative play. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|Here, the contract can be virtually guaranteed as long as the diamond finesse is not taken. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


md|0,dk,,d7|nt|^z@3^b@2
It is true that not taking the diamond finesse on this deal would cost you an overtrick when the @DK was dealt to West, but that should not concern you.

|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Making overtricks is not nearly as important as making your contract. Do not even 
think about trying for overtricks until you are certain that your contract is safe! }|

nt|^z@3^b@2
The alarm bells in your head should be going off - why would West lead back a suit in which the dummy is so strong |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
instead of one of the dummy's weak suits? |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The only answer that makes much sense is that East was dealt a singleton club and that he is hoping to win a trick with a ruff in that suit. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

pg| ***** 58 ***** |


up|12|nt|^z@3^b@2
Going back to trick 3  -  You face what looks like an obvious finessing position. In this deal the finesse is in the trump suit itself (it was in a side suit in the previous deal). 

Here you should realize that you can afford to lose a trick to the @HK, but that you cannot afford to lose a second trump trick should the defenders be able to engineer a ruff. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |

If you had taken a few extra seconds to ask yourself what could go wrong on this easy-looking deal, you would have come up with the answer.

The second half of the battle is to figure out a way to win 12 tricks if clubs are indeed 4-1. |

First things first - you know that West is now void in hearts. East opened the bidding with a weak 2-bid in hearts, promising 6 cards in that suit. The dummy was dealt 3 hearts and you were dealt 2 hearts. That leaves 2 hearts for West and he has played both of them.

The maneuver of discarding your certain diamond loser on the third round of hearts is known as a loser on loser play. A loser on loser play is defined by discarding a loser (as opposed to ruffing) when you know the opponents are going to win the trick. In this example, the declarer loses a third heart trick instead of losing 2 heart tricks and a diamond trick. |
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


pc|d2|nt|^z@3^b@2
This trade breaks even, but the declarer avoids losing a trump trick in the process. |

There are many situations where the declarer can benefit from making a  ^*b loser on loser ^*n  play. |

nt|^z@3^b@2
In this particular deal, the point of this play is to prevent a possible trump promotion by the ^*bdefense^*N. |
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It would not be practical at this point to try to illustrate all of the other positions in which the ^*bdeclarer^*N can effectively utilize the loser on loser play, but make sure to add this technique to your repertoire - you never know when a deal that calls for a loser on loser play might arise!|

First let's take a moment to discuss the bidding. North's 3@D response to South's 2NT opening bid was a Jacoby transfer bid promising at least 5 cards in hearts. |

South, with 21 HCP, has a maximum 2NT opening. |

Add to this his 4-card support for hearts and his hand is appropriate to super-accept the Jacoby transfer by jumping to 4@H. That's just as well since North might have passed 3@H if South had simply completed the transfer by bidding 3@H.|

^*BHoward Schutzman:  ^*N|cp||at|Many teachers recommend, when declaring, you count winners in NT contracts and losers in suit contracts. But Howard personally always counts winners in both NT and suit contracts and recommends you do the same. After all, your goal is to win tricks, not to lose tricks.

So if you can come up with a plan to win enough tricks to fulfill your contract, you will play the hand correctly. You can also count losers (and there is no harm in doing so) but you should always count winners.|

Unfortunately, this clever line of play would not work on the actual layout. East was dealt 3 hearts and only 2 clubs and he is thus able to ruff the third round of clubs to defeat your contract.

Don't let it bother you if you answered "no" to the last question. This is the most difficult deal in any of the sections. The correct solution involves using a technique known as a dummy reversal. Not only is the dummy reversal considered an advanced technique, many players find deals that call for a dummy reversal to be difficult to identify in practice. 

Let's first go through the correct play sequence before we get into any further discussion about dummy reversals.|
pg| ***** 356 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You should start by leading a diamond to the dummy's @DA |

up|39|nt|^z@3^b@2
So now that you have seen a dummy reversal in action, it is time to answer the question of what exactly this mysterious technique consists of.
|
pg| ***** 376 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|

^-{ A dummy reversal involves taking enough ruffs in the long trump hand so that 
 what was originally the short trump hand eventually becomes the long trump hand. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 377 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In this deal South started with 5 trumps and North started with 3 trumps so South originally had the long trump hand. |
pg| ***** 378 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
By taking 3 diamond ruffs in the South hand, the North hand becomes the long trump hand and a dummy reversal has taken place. If all of this talk about long and short trump hands is confusing, another way to think about this technique is that it involves the declarer attempting to get rid of the dummy's losers rather than those in his own hand.|
pg| ***** 379 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When you are the declarer in a trump contract and your partner puts down the dummy, it is natural to think about the deal from your own point of view. The typical thinking pattern is to count your own losers and to try to find ways of getting rid of any losers^*n that you cannot afford to have. Here, for example, the only possible ^*nloser in the South hand is in clubs, but there is no effective play available for the declarer to eliminate this loser.|
pg| ***** 380 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On some deals, it is more effective to think about things from the dummy's point of view. Here, for example, the dummy has 3 losers (all in diamonds) and there is a fairly straightforward way of getting rid of them - they can all be ruffed in the South hand. It is true that the dummy has more losers than the declarer does, but at least the dummy's losers are easy to get rid of.|
pg| ***** 381 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
One of the interesting aspects of this deal is that the club loser in the South hand actually does go away - it ends up being ^*bdiscarded^*N when the dummy's hearts are used to draw trump! 
|
pg| ***** 382 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|
^-{ One of the defining characteristics of a dummy reversal is that the trumps in the 
 short trump hand are eventually used to discard losers from the long trump hand. }

^*BHoward Scutzman:  ^*N|cp||at|Dummy reversals are hard to visualize. But counting winners is a good way to help you figure out when a dummy reversal is appropriate. On this hand, your goal is to come to 12 tricks.

nt|^z@3^b@2|cp|red|AT|
^*BHoward Scutzman:  ^*N|cp||at|But another way to play for 12 tricks is to try for 6 heart winners. And if you ruff 3 diamonds in your hand, you can count 6 heart winners. How? Well you get 3 ruffs in your hand. Additionally, the 3 trump  tricks in dummy are 3 more trump tricks for a total of 6.

So counting trump winners can help you visualize how a "dummy reversal" gets you an extra trick. You don't need to bother with worrying about losers. You are simply counting winners. The losers take care of themselves.|

The main purpose of this chapter was to introduce some new techniques that you can apply as the declarer when you are playing in a trump contract. Trump management is the term that is used to describe the family of techniques that involve the proper handling of the trump suit.

All of the deals that you played in this chapter involved some aspect of trump management, but as you have seen, the subject of trump management is a very broad topic as it covers issues such as:

Before we review the trump management techniques that have been covered in this chapter, here is a reminder of some of the important lessons that we have seen that apply to all deals (even when the contract is notrump) in which you are the declarer:

|
pg| ***** 400 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Making overtricks is not nearly as important as making your contract. Do not even 
think about trying for overtricks until you are certain that your contract is safe! }

|
pg| ***** 401 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ When faced with what looks like an obvious finesse, ask yourself what will happen next if the 
 finesse loses (and also if it wins). If something could go wrong, look for an alternative play. }

|
pg| ***** 402 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ Think about the whole deal before playing to the first trick. If you have a choice as to  
 where to win the first trick, think about the consequences of the alternatives that you have. }

|
pg| ***** 403 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ When a certain line of play seems obvious, ask yourself "what will happen next?" and 
 "what could go wrong?". Think about the consequences of your plan before you adopt it! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 404 ***** |


at|Moving on to trump management, here are 2 guidelines that we have encountered that concern ruffing losers in the dummy. These guidelines may seem obvious to you, but all bridge players are guilty of ignoring them on occasion. Sometimes when they do so, the result is that a contract that should have succeeded is defeated!

|
pg| ***** 405 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Always ruff with the highest trump that you can afford! }

|
pg| ***** 406 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ Do not ruff with a trump that is higher than you can afford! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 407 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|At|Here is a tip that will make it easier for you to form a plan on some deals with a trump suit:

|
pg| ***** 408 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Counting losers when there is a trump suit is a sound practice, but it cannot hurt to count 
 winners as well. Looking at a deal from more than one perspective can sometimes help! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 409 ***** |


at|The same is true when the contract is notrump. Usually counting your winners at notrump is the way to go, but it is a good idea to count the number of tricks that you might lose as well!

|
pg| ***** 410 ***** |


at|Here is a reminder of some of the general trump management issues that arose in this chapter:

|
pg| ***** 411 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ If taking a finesse in the trump suit runs the risk of the defenders getting a ruff,
 give some thought to refusing the finesse and playing the trumps from the top instead. }

|
pg| ***** 412 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ A trump suit can be used for entries, but on some deals the declarer must be 
 careful to unblock in the trump suit in order to get the entries that he needs. } 

|
pg| ***** 413 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ If a bad break in a side suit will create an unexpected loser, consider drawing 
 only some of the outstanding trump and then testing the layout of that side suit. }

|
pg| ***** 414 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ While it is usually best to leave a defender with the master card in trump, there are deals in 
 which it is correct to use 2 of your trumps to take out one high trump held by a defender. }

|
pg| ***** 415 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ If the defenders are threatening your trump control with the forcing game, consider
 leaving a trump policeman in dummy to protect you from ruffing too much in your hand. }

|
pg| ***** 416 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There were 2 entirely new techniques that were introduced in this chapter: the loser on loser play and the dummy reversal. While the dummy reversal by its very nature can only occur when there is a trump suit, the loser on loser play can sometimes be used in notrump contracts as well. There are actually several situations where a loser on loser play can help the declarer. In this chapter we saw how this technique can be used to prevent a trump promotion.

|
pg| ***** 417 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The loser on loser play involves discarding a loser (not ruffing) when the opponents 
 are certain to win the trick. This play trades a loser in one suit for a loser in another suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 418 ***** |


at|The dummy reversal is the most advanced declarer play technique that was presented in this program. The hardest thing about dummy reversals is identifying deals in which they should be employed. Once the need for a dummy reversal is realized, the execution of the dummy reversal is usually not that difficult.

|
pg| ***** 419 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ A dummy reversal involves taking enough ruffs in the long trump hand so that 
 what was originally the short trump hand eventually becomes the long trump hand. }

|
pg| ***** 420 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ In most deals the long trump hand is used for drawing trump and the short trump hand is 
 used for ruffing losers. The opposite is the case when a dummy reversal takes place. }

 short trump hand are eventually used to discard losers from the long trump hand. }|
