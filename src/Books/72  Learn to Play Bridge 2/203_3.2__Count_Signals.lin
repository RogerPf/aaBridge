Now that you are familiar (and hopefully comfortable) with attitude signals, it is time to turn our attention to the study of another type of defensive signal: count signals. Here is a reminder of the purpose of using count signals and the messages that these signals convey:

|
qx|3.2|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Count signals are used to tell your partner whether you have an even 
 (2, 4, 6, or 8) or an odd (1, 3, 5, or 7) number of cards in a specific suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|So count signals are used to describe the number of cards that a player holds in a given suit, but these signals do not reveal the exact number of cards that the signaler holds. Count signals specify only whether the number of cards held is even (2, 4, 6, or 8) or odd (1, 3, 5, or 7).

It is up to the partner of the player who makes a count signal to try to figure out the exact number of cards that his partner holds in a given suit. A lot of the time he will be able to use factors like the count signal that he received, the bidding, and inferences from the way the play has gone so far to figure out exactly how many cards his partner was dealt in each suit. As we have seen:

|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Defense becomes a lot easier when you can figure out the contents of the unseen hands! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|Attitude signals can help a defender figure out the location of key missing honor cards and count signals can help a defender figure out the distribution of the unseen hands. By using both of these types of signals, the defenders are often in a position to tell each other everything they need to know in order to defend accurately. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


tb||

nt|^b@2^z@3
Here are the basic mechanics of how count signals work:

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Play a high card to show your partner that you have an even number of cards in that suit. 
 Play a low card to show your partner that you have an odd number of cards in that suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|It would be natural for you to be somewhat confused after reading the above description of how count signals work. You have already learned that a defender can play a high card as an encouraging attitude signal or a low card as a discouraging attitude signal. Now you are being told that high and low cards can also be used as count signals. How is a defender supposed to know whether his partner is signaling attitude or count?

|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ The situation in which a signal is made determines the type of signal that is being used. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|We have already seen that attitude signals are used only in a few well-defined situations. The same is true of count signals. There are 2 main situations in which a defender should give a count signal:

|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ 1. Signal count when the declarer leads a suit from his hand or from the dummy. }

|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ 2. Signal count if your attitude toward a suit is already known. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|Later in this chapter we will encounter one other situation where a defender should give his partner a count signal. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|n#|5|at|The same warnings that apply to attitude signals should be kept in mind when giving count signals as well. In particular:

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Winning tricks takes priority over giving accurate signals! Don't forget about things 
 like second hand low, third hand high, and splitting honors for the sake of signaling! }

|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ Always signal with the loudest card that you can afford to play. The clearer your signals are, 
 the more likely it will be that your partner will get the message that you were trying to convey! }

|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ Both the declarer and your partner can see your signals. Knowing your count in a suit  
 will sometimes be more helpful to the declarer. Be careful about when you choose to signal! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|The last of these warnings is particularly important when it comes to count signals. As you know, when a declarer is able to figure out the distribution of the defenders' hands, he is sometimes able to play the hand as if he could see all the cards. Guessing is a normal part of declarer play on a lot of deals. Defenders who give too many count signals will take away a lot of the guesses that the declarer normally would have to make.

At this early point in your study of count signals it is best not to worry about this too much. You will learn through experience some of the situations where your count signals do more harm than good, but here are 2 sensible guidelines to keep in mind:

|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Do not signal count if you know that this information will not be relevant to your partner. }

|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ Do not signal count if your partner already knows your count (perhaps from the bidding). }

|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ha|y|rh||st||md|1c4,c3,ckqjt9c,ca82|


nt|^b@2^z@3Here is an example to illustrate the power of count signals. You are sitting East. South opened the bidding with 2NT and was raised to 3NT by North. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|North put down a very nice club suit in the dummy and 8 small cards in the other 3 suits. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|Your partner's opening lead was won by the declarer who then led the @C4 out of his hand. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


pc|c4|at|Your partner followed suit with the @C3 |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|c|at|and South called for one of dummy's 5 equal clubs. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|c|at|Would you take your @CA or not? |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Your best strategy as a defender in this situation is to take your @CA at a point when South is out of clubs. We have already seen some examples of when a defender should use the hold up play, but this is arguably the most common (and useful) situation for using that technique on defense. By holding up your @CA until just the right moment, you will be able to minimize the number of tricks that the declarer will be able to win in this suit.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3You should definitely hold up at least once because South would not open the bidding with 2NT if he had a singleton club. You might as well start getting into the habit of giving your partner count signals so play the @C2 (as opposed to the @C8) to let your partner know that you have an odd number of clubs. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


pc|c2|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer leads another club from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


pc|ck|at|This time you do have a problem as to whether or not you should take your @CA. There are 3 missing small clubs. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


md|0c5|at|You know South has at least one of these clubs (because his 2NT opening bid promised a balanced hand), but the location of the other 2 clubs is a mystery. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|Either winning this trick or ducking your @CA again could be the most effective defense depending on the location of the 2 missing clubs. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


md|0c67|

nt|^b@2^z@3If South has all of the outstanding clubs, |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|the play you make now is unlikely to matter. South was dealt more clubs than you were so you cannot hold up your @CA enough times to exhaust his supply of cards in the suit. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


md|0,c76|at|If your partner has 2 of the 3 missing clubs |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|then South has exactly one club left |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|and it would be best for the defense if you took your @CA now. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


pc|cacc|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|Since declarer has no clubs left in his hand and no other entries to the dummy, North's club winners are stranded. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


up|3|md|0c6|

nt|^b@2^z@3If it turns out that your partner has only 1 of the 3 missing clubs, |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|leaving more clubs in the declarer's hand, |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|you will do best to duck your @CA a second time. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


pc|c8cc|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|There may not be any point in the declarer playing a third round of clubs now, but if he does you can win your @CA and know that he will never be able to get back to the dummy to enjoy the 2 established club winners. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


up|3|md|0c7|

nt|^b@2^z@3To summarize, if South has all 3 of the missing clubs, |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at|the play you make on the second round of clubs is unlikely to matter. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


md|0,c7|at|If South has 2 of the 3 missing clubs, |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|you will do best to hold up your @CA a second time. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


md|0,c6|at|If South has only 1 of the 3 missing clubs, |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|the most effective defense will be to win your @CA on the second round of the suit. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|Knowing the number of cards that South was dealt in clubs would be a very helpful piece of information for you to have right now! |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3As you have probably realized, the way in which East can know his best strategy in the club suit |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


up|4|at|is for West to give him a count signal on the first round of clubs. This is clearly a situation for count signals (as opposed to attitude signals) because clubs is a suit that the declarer has led. Attitude signals do not apply when the defenders are following suit to a trick where the lead came from the declarer or the dummy. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3When West has 3 clubs (an odd number), |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|he can pass on that message to his partner by following suit with his lowest club. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


pc|c3|at|In this particular example, it will be easy for East to read this signal. He can see the @C2 in his own hand so West's @C3 must be the lowest club that West was dealt. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


md|0c76|at|Either West started with a singleton @C3 (leaving South with so many clubs that East's play will not matter) |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


md|0,c76|at|or West was dealt 3 clubs. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|East will know to hold up his @CA exactly once. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


up|1|md|0c6|

nt|^b@2^z@3If instead West started with 2 clubs (an even number of cards) |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|his count signal should be the higher of his 2 spot cards, the @C7 in this case. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


pc|c7|at|Given the dummy's club holding and the fact that East holds the @C8, East knows that the @C7 is West's highest club. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


md|0c3|at|The @C7 could be a singleton (in which case East's play does not matter) |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


md|0,c3|at|or West began with a doubleton club. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at|In that case South still has 2 clubs left and East should hold up his @CA twice. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3In this example hand, West was fortunate to have been dealt spot cards in clubs that were sufficiently high and low to make his count signals clear. As with attitude signals, a defender will not always be dealt spot cards that allow him to clearly convey the message that he would like to send his partner. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


md|0c87,c32,,c65|

nt|^b@2^z@3For example, West now has the @C32 doubleton. He would like to tell his partner that he has an even number of clubs, |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at|but the best he can do is play the @C3 which is not exactly a high club. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


md|0c5,c876,,c32|at|Here West clubs are the @C8, @C7, and @C6. He would like East to know that he has an odd number of clubs, |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at|but his lowest club is the @C6 which is a relatively high card as far as spot cards go. All West can do is play this card and hope that East can work out the position.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|d|cs|2|at|^-{Defenders are not always dealt the perfect spot cards for the signals that they want 
 to make. All they can do is signal as loudy as possible with the cards that they were dealt. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


ht|p|at|In all types of signals there will be situations where even the loudest card a player holds will carry an ambiguous message. Even the best defenders sometimes misread each others' signals.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


md|1h3,h94,haq5|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is another card combination that illustrates both the advantages and the possible dangers of using count signals on defense. South, the declarer in a notrump contract, leads the @H3 out of his hand. |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


pc|h3|at|You are sitting West and since you have 2 hearts (an even number), |
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|you can play the @H9 as a count signal. |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


pc|h9|

md|0hk87,,,hjt62|

nt|^b@2^z@3Why would East care about how many hearts you were dealt in this situation? Well, perhaps the remaining unseen hearts are distributed as above. |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at|South wins the first heart trick in the dummy |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


pc|hq|at|and, for the sake of practice, let's have East give count in hearts as well. East has an even number of hearts (4). He should therefore play the highest heart that he can afford. This happens to be the @H6. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


pc|h6|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer still has 2 certain heart tricks with high honors in that suit. |
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


at|The good news for the defense is that East's remaining @HJ102 is strong enough to prevent South from winning any further tricks in hearts. The only catch is that East must retain all of his hearts. If he discards from this suit then South will be able to win an undeserved 4th trick in hearts.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Looking at the entire heart suit and none of the other suits, it may be difficult for you to imagine why East would ever discard a heart. Well, East may be faced with a situation where he has to discard ^*Isomething^*N and his holdings in the other 3 suits might look ever more valuable than his holding in hearts. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3When East receives a count signal suggesting that his partner was dealt an even number of hearts, |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


pc|h9|at|East might wake up and realize that it is critical for him to keep all of his cards in that suit. East can see 4 hearts in his own hand |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


at|and 3 hearts in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|If the even number of hearts that West started with was 2, |
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


at|then South was dealt 4 hearts. |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


at|East will be in a position to know that discarding a heart could be very damaging to the defense. |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


up|2|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now let's take South's @H7 and give it to West. |
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


md|0,h7|

nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer still has exactly 3 winners in hearts between his own hand and the dummy, but since neither South nor North have more than 3 cards in hearts, there is no way that the declarer could ever win more than 3 heart tricks. |
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


at|As such, it is perfectly safe for East to discard a heart. |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


at|When South leads the @H3 out of his hand, |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


pc|h3|at|West, who now has an odd number of hearts, will play his lowest heart, the @H4, as a count signal. |
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|pc|h4|at|The dummy wins the trick and East plays the @H6 as a count signal as before. |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


pc|hqh6|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


at|East knows that he started with 4 hearts |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


at|and that the dummy started with 3 hearts. |
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


md|0h97|at|Unless West's @H3 was a singleton (meaning that South has all the rest of the hearts), |
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


md|0,h97|at|East knows from his partner's count signal that West was dealt an odd number of hearts. |
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


at|It will be very likely from East's point of view that South began with exactly 3 cards in hearts. |
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3East can use the information about South's likely heart length |
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


at|to know that, later in the play, he can safely discard a heart without having to worry about giving up a trick in that suit. |
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


md|0h97|at|What if it turns out that West's @H4 was really a singleton and that South started with 5 cards in hearts? |
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


At|In this case a heart discard from East would be a disaster for the defense. Fortunately, East will usually know from the bidding if it is possible that South had been dealt 5 cards in hearts. |
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


md|0,h9|up|4|

nt|^b@2^z@3So far the only consequence that we have seen of West giving a count signal in hearts |
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


at|is that East is able to learn if he needs to hold on to all 4 of his hearts or if it safe to discard from that suit. That can only be a good thing for the defense. |
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


at|However, if we take East's @H10 and exchange it for one of South's spot cards in hearts (let's use the @H7), one of the dangers of using count signals will become apparent. |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


md|0ht,,,h7|

nt|^b@2^z@3South leads the @H3 as before |
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


pc|h3|at|and West plays the @H9 as a count signal to tell his partner that he has an even number of hearts. |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


pc|h9|at|This trick is won in the dummy |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


pc|Hq|at|and East plays the @H7 as a count signal, suggesting that he also has an even number of hearts. |
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


pc|h7|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


at|Dummy's remaining heart honor is cashed. |
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


pc|ha|at|This declarer happens to be quite astute and he notices that both defenders follow suit with lower cards than they played on the first round of hearts. |
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


pc|hhh|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3When the third round of hearts is led from the dummy |
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


pc|h|at|and East follows suit with the @H6, |
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


pc|h6|at|South is faced with a choice between playing the @HK and finessing the @H10. |
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


At|The declarer has a guess to make. If East still has the @HJ, the winning play will be to finesse the @H10, |
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


pc|ht|md|0,hj|at|but the finesse will fail if West has the @HJ. |
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


up|1|at|On this layout South can come to a 4th heart trick by playing his @HK on the third round (as opposed to finessing the @H10). |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


lc|

nt|^b@2^z@3

nt|^b@2^z@3This is a close decision for the declarer. In the absence of any special information, |
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


at|the correct percentage play is to go up with the @HK on the third round in the hope that the @HJ will fall. |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


up|10|at|The way that the declarer should play this card combination is not central to the lesson being covered, but it is a useful thing for you to know. |
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


md|0,,,hj|at|A declarer who knows the correct play in hearts would normally win only 3 tricks when East started with 4 hearts headed by the @HJ. |
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3An astute declarer might alter his normal plan in hearts, however, if the defenders decide to use count signals in this suit. |
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


at|In particular, if both defenders play high spot cards on the first round of hearts, the declarer will think that they both started with an even number of hearts. |
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


at|When the time comes for the declarer to make his decision, there is a good chance that he will make the winning play of finessing the @H10 (a play that he would not normally make). |
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose that only one defender gives an honest count signal. For the sake of argument, assume that West plays the @H9 (the correct count card), but that East plays the @H2 (an incorrect count card since East has an even number of hearts). South will know that one of the defenders is giving false count (because there are 6 hearts missing and there is no way that an even number plus an odd number can add up to 6). |
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer will have no way of knowing which of the defenders is telling the truth and which of the defenders is giving false count. He may still make the winning guess on the third round of hearts, |
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


at|but his chances of doing so are less than if both defenders had given honest count signals. |
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


at|If both defenders have the presence of mind to give false count in this suit, it is most unlikely that the declarer will figure out what is going on. |
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3This is one card combination in which honest count signals by the defenders rate to help the declarer more than the defense. |
pg| ***** 133 ***** |

ht|p|at|When to give false count |
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


at|and when to give true count is a matter of judgment. At this point in your career as a defender you will do best if you usually tell the truth with your signals!|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3You should know that most introductory books on defense do not even mention the possibility of intentionally giving misleading signals in order to fool the declarer. That may be just as well since it takes a lot of experience to know when to apply this tactic. There is a definite danger in giving false count, especially if you do it a lot - your partner will not know when he should trust your signals and he will sometimes make bad decisions on defense as a result.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3It is probably best if you always try to give honest signals on defense given your current level of experience, but you should know that, on occasion, you may win an extra trick or 2 by signaling inaccurately. One of the reasons that it is important for you to know this is so that you will not always trust the count signals that your opponents give when you are the declarer! This is especially true if you are playing against experienced players.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3It has been mentioned in the program that there is no place for cheating in bridge, but occasionally straying from the signaling agreements that you and your partner have is not cheating. As with bidding agreements, partnerships are required to tell their opponents about the defensive signaling agreements that they made. If they choose to not follow their signaling (or bidding) agreements from time to time, that is not against the rules of bridge.|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3What would be against the rules of bridge would be for a partnership to make a secret agreement like: we will always give false count when we defend against slam contracts, but we won't tell the opponents about it! The bottom line in bridge is that each partnership is entitled to know ^*Iall^*N of the agreements about bidding and signaling that the opponents have made.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Sorry about this diversion, but now that you are learning about count signals, you should understand that using these signals is not without risk - sometimes the only player that they help is the declarer. Once you are able to appreciate this, you might as well know that there is something you can do about it. |
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


at|A well-timed false count signal is a perfectly legal maneuver that can be used to lead the declarer astray! |

nt|^b@2^z@3In this next example card combination, spades is a side suit in a trump contract. West leads the @SA (suggesting that he holds the @SK as well). |

nt|^b@2^z@3If you are confused as to why East should be giving attitude rather than count here, remember that there are situations where signals should be attitude and other situations where signals should be count. One of the situations for attitude signals applies here: when your partner leads an honor card to a trick, signal attitude. |

pg| ***** 153 ***** |


pc|St|at|and East has to select a card to play. Since winning this trick is not in the picture for East, this is an opportunity for him to give his partner another signal. Do you have any ideas on what card East should play now?|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The first thing you should know is this: there is no reason for East to give his partner another attitude signal. West already knows that East was dealt the @SQ because his attitude signal of the @S9 on the first trick suggested that he held that card. It would be a waste of a signal for East to try to confirm the message that he already sent his partner!|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|d|cs|1|at|^-{ In general, you can only use each type of signal once in a given suit. In particular, once 
 you have given an attitude signal in a suit, the next signal in that suit is a count signal. }

|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


ht|p|at|Since West already knows East's attitude toward spades, East should take advantage of this opportunity and tell his partner something else about his spade holding - his count in that suit. |
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
So East should give a count signal now and the @S8 is the correct card to play for this purpose. East should play a high spot card because he has an even number of spades remaining. The @S8 is the best high spade for East to play because it is the loudest card that he can afford. |
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|2|ht|d|at|^-{ When giving count in a suit in which you have already played a card, your signal describes

pg| ***** 159 ***** |


ht|q|at|East was dealt 5 spades (an odd number), but he has only 4 (an even number) left at the time that he is making his signal. The @S8 is the correct signal to reflect his current number of spades. |
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|3|ht|d|at|^-{ Bridge players use the terms present count, current count, and remainder count to

ht|q|at|Here we would say that East's @S8 is a present count (or current count or remainder count) signal because East has already played the @S9. |
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3You may be asking yourself why West would care about how many spades East has left in his hand. On some deals this information may not be relevant to West, but sometimes knowing East's spade count will be important to West's defense. When East plays the @S8 on the second round of the suit (indicating that he has an even number of spades remaining), |

West will have to consider factors like the bidding and the cards in the dummy to make this decision. Knowing the spade layout will often help West to figure out the best defense.|

nt|^b@2^z@3If we give South one of East's small spades, |

nt|^b@2^z@3In the first 2 examples of count signals that we saw, the count signal took place when the declarer led a suit.

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is another example of the same principle. West's opening lead against a notrump contract is the @H2. Assume that the bidding suggests that South has either 2 or 3 hearts (perhaps South opened the bidding with 1NT and denied a 4-card major over North's 2@C Stayman inquiry). |

pg| ***** 180 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Your first thought might be that this is a situation for attitude signals. Up until now we have always used attitude signals when our partner has led the first round of a suit. You may have figured out that this situation is different - East should give a count signal, not an attitude signal. |
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


at|East should play the @H3 to show his partner that he has an odd number of cards in hearts. |
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


pc|h3|

nt|^b@2^z@3The reason that East should not signal attitude is that his partner will know his attitude in hearts. The @HK is the only relevant honor card in this situation and East would always win the trick with the @HK here if he had been dealt that card. |
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


md|0hj6,hk54|at|West already knows who has the @HK. Either he is looking at the @HK in his own hand |

nt|^b@2^z@3If the heart suit is distributed as above it may be very useful for West to know how many hearts his partner was dealt. Here, when East plays the @H3 as a count signal to suggest an odd number of hearts, |
pg| ***** 186 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3In this example, diamonds is a side suit in a trump contract and West's opening lead is the @DA which strongly suggests that West has the @DK as well. |

pc|da|at|The @D5 is played from the dummy. |

nt|^b@2^z@3In this example, however, the @DQ is in the dummy. Both defenders can see that card so East's attitude toward diamonds is already known. |
pg| ***** 213 ***** |


At|As such, it makes sense for East to give a count signal. East has an even number of diamonds so he should play the highest card that he can afford in the suit. That would be the @D8. |

at|Since East will be left with a diamond, West will not be able to give him a ruff in this suit. |
pg| ***** 230 ***** |


up|6|md|0d2|

nt|^b@2^z@3The concept of East giving count in this situation makes a lot of sense because the sight of the dummy's diamond holding makes his attitude toward diamonds obvious to West. It works well for East to tell his partner that he has a doubleton diamond - East will receive a ruff thanks to this count signal. Still, there are a couple of problems with this type of signal that we are going to explore in detail. |
pg| ***** 231 ***** |


md|0,,,d72|

nt|^b@2^z@3The first problem is that when East has 4 diamonds, he also has an even number of cards in the suit. |
pg| ***** 232 ***** |


at|If East gives his partner an appropriate count signal, |
pg| ***** 233 ***** |


pc|d8d|
pg| ***** 234 ***** |


at|West will probably lead the @DK to the next trick. |
pg| ***** 235 ***** |


pc|dk|at|This rates to be a disaster for the defense since South will be able to ruff and a diamond winner will be set up in the dummy as a result. The declarer will be able to use this winner to discard one of his losers in another side suit.|
pg| ***** 236 ***** |


up|5|md|0d72|

nt|^b@2^z@3The second problem with the signaling methods that have been described so far can be seen if we switch the diamonds between the North and South hands. |
pg| ***** 237 ***** |


md|0dqj5,,dt72|at|Now, when West leads the @DA, |
pg| ***** 238 ***** |


pc|Da|at|the dummy's diamonds are such that East's attitude toward diamonds is not known. As far as West is concerned, East could have the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 239 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The dummy's @D2 is played |
pg| ***** 240 ***** |


pc|d2|at|and, based on what we have learned so far, East's proper signal is the @D4 - a discouraging attitude signal to suggest that East does not hold the @DQ. If East signals with the @D4 |
pg| ***** 241 ***** |


pc|d4|at|and South follows suit with the @D5, |
pg| ***** 242 ***** |


pc|d5|
pg| ***** 243 ***** |


at|West may well decide not to play his @DK to the next trick. He may switch to a different suit based on his partner's discouraging attitude signal in diamonds. The defense might never get a diamond ruff as a result.|
pg| ***** 244 ***** |


up|2|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|The solution to this problem is relatively simple, but it does contradict one of the lessons that we have learned about attitude signals:
|
pg| ***** 245 ***** |


ht|o|cs|2|at|^-{ When partner leads an Ace against a trump contract, offer him an encouraging 
 attitude signal if you have either the Queen or a doubleton in the suit that he led. }
|
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3In almost all other situations where attitude signals apply, an encouraging attitude signal suggests a useful honor card. Here, the encouraging attitude signal suggests that you are interested in receiving a ruff. Whether you should really consider this an attitude signal (suggesting you like diamonds) or a count signal (suggesting you have a doubleton diamond) does not matter. What is important is giving a signal that will get your partner to do the right thing!|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3We have discussed attitude signals in the sense that they should be used to either show or deny possession of an important honor card. Here is another way to think about these signals:

|
pg| ***** 248 ***** |


cs|1|ht|n|at|^-{ An encouraging attitude signal means that you want partner to lead the suit
 that you encouraged, but it does not promise any specific holding in that suit. }

|
pg| ***** 249 ***** |


up|2|md|0dt,,dqj5,d72|

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's revisit a layout of the diamond suit that we have seen before. West leads the @DA |
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


pc|da|at|and the @D5 is played from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 251 ***** |


pc|d5|at|East's attitude toward diamonds is known in the sense that he cannot have a relevant honor in that suit (because the @DQ is in the dummy), but since East could still have a doubleton diamond, he might want his partner to continue playing that suit. |
pg| ***** 252 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Therefore, East should not signal his count in diamonds (by playing the @D8), |
pg| ***** 253 ***** |


at|he should signal his attitude toward diamonds by playing the @D2. |

pc|d2|at|South follows suit with his singleton @D10 and West's @DA wins the trick. |

at|Hopefully West will get the message that his partner does not want him to lead the @DK to the next trick. West will switch to another suit and that rates to be a good thing for the defense. |

md|4ha97,h5c98754,h8642,hkqjt3|


nt|^b@2^z@3Here is another example of giving a count signal when your attitude toward a suit is known already. Sometime during the play of the hand, East leads the @HK. |

pg| ***** 278 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Recall, however, that this is a special situation. When your partner leads an Ace against a trump contract (suggesting that he has the King of that suit as well), you should encourage if you have either the Queen or a doubleton in the suit that he led. ^^^^You have a doubleton club so you should play the @C9 here. You can call the @C9 an encouraging attitude signal or a count signal. Whatever you call it, the @C9 is the right card to play!|

nt|^b@2^z@3You may have received the impression from the example deals you have seen so far that the defense can always defeat the declarer's contract. Of course, that is not true. Some contracts are destined to succeed, regardless of how well the defenders play. Still, it is a good exercise for the defenders to ask themselves if they could have done any better whenever the declarer makes his contract. ^^^^Do you see any way the defense could have come out on top on this deal?|
pg| ***** 301 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Yes, the defense could have defeated the contract. In this case it was up to you - there was nothing that your partner could have done.

nt|^b@2^z@3Bridge is a difficult game and even the best players sometimes make mistakes. When you make mistakes you may feel badly about it. If your partner gets angry at you, it will only make you feel worse (and it will not help you to play better on the next deal). If your partner is supportive when you err, it really helps. 

Make sure you are understanding when your partner makes a mistake. A happy partnership makes for a more pleasant bridge game (not to mention better bridge results).|

|
pg| ***** 369 ***** |


at|^^^-{ Sometimes it is necessary for a defender to keep in mind that his 
 partner's signal may not be a signal at all - it may be a singleton! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 370 ***** |


at|Here West must decide if East played the @C9 from a doubleton |
pg| ***** 371 ***** |


md|0c5,,,d5|at|or because it was singleton. |
pg| ***** 372 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3There is no way for West to know for sure if East was dealt a singleton |
pg| ***** 373 ***** |


md|0d5,,,c5|at|or a doubleton in clubs, but there are a few reasons why a doubleton is more likely. |
pg| ***** 374 ***** |


at|For one thing, South has shown at least 5 hearts in the bidding, leaving East with 3 hearts at the most. |
pg| ***** 375 ***** |


md|0c5,,,d5|at|^^^^It is therefore unlikely that South has more clubs than East. |
pg| ***** 376 ***** |


at|Furthermore, if South did have 3 small clubs he might not have rebid 4@H as that would represent a serious weakness in his hand. |
pg| ***** 377 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Finally, there is a mathematical reason why it is unlikely that East has a singleton @C9. There is only 1 layout in which the @C9 is a singleton, |
pg| ***** 378 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3As with most of the example deals in this program, the one you just saw covers a lot of ground. Before we go on to the next example deal, it is worth noting that, once again, it was necessary for East-West to work together as a partnership in order to defeat the declarer's contract. Good signaling is one of the key aspects of defending as a partnership, but as this deal illustrates, it is also critical to trust your partner to have a good reasons for playing the cards that he does!|

nt|^b@2^z@3In this next example deal, you are West. South, the dealer, opens the bidding with 2NT and North raises to 3NT. Your opening lead is the @S4 (your 4th best spade since your spades are not headed by any kind of sequence). |
pg| ***** 418 ***** |


pc|s4|at|The declarer calls for the dummy's @SQ. |
pg| ***** 419 ***** |


pc|sqss|at|You hope that your partner will produce the @SK, but he plays the @S3 and the declarer follows with the @S6. |
pg| ***** 420 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Now that you are learning about signaling you had better pay attention to your partner's spot cards! What is the nature of the message that your partner's @S3 delivered? The @S3 is clearly your partner's lowest spade (since you have the @S2), but is it a discouraging attitude signal or a count signal showing an odd number of spades? |
pg| ***** 421 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3This is an attitude situation because spades is a suit that you have led and your partner's attitude in spades is not obvious from the first trick. Actually your partner's attitude to the first trick is obvious to you because you have the @SA and @SJ and clearly your partner does not have the @SK (or he would have covered dummy's @SQ with that card). So you do know your partner's attitude in spades, but he doesn't know that you know his attitude!|
pg| ***** 422 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Hopefully you did not find that explanation too confusing! What it boils down to is that since you are looking at the @SJ, you know that your partner has no important honor cards in spades. Your partner doesn't know that you have the @SJ, however, and from his point of view it might be important for him to tell you that he does not hold that card. It might be nice to know East's count in spades, but instead you have been told his attitude - something you already know!|

pg| ***** 424 ***** |


ht|q|at|It would be nice if East knew that you had the @SJ. Then he could give you a count signal which would be more useful to you in this position since you already know his attitude toward spades! |
pg| ***** 425 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer leads a club from the dummy at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 426 ***** |


pc|cc5ck|at|Your partner plays the @C5 and South puts up the @CK. What do you make of your partner's @C5? |
pg| ***** 427 ***** |


at|East's @C5 is a count signal. Knowing East's club count is going to be helpful because you should plan to hold up your @CA until South is out of clubs. The only way you can know that South is out of clubs is to know how many clubs he started with. East's @C5 should help you to figure that out.|
pg| ***** 428 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3On the surface, the @C5 looks like a pretty low club. If it is East's smallest club then he has an odd number of cards in clubs. That odd number would have to be 3. That would leave South with 2 cards in clubs and suggest that holding up your @CA until the second round of the suit would be the best strategy on this deal. |
pg| ***** 429 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3However, if you look carefully at your own club holding and the clubs in the dummy you will realize that if East really has 3 clubs, then the @C5 cannot possibly be his lowest club. You can see all of the clubs higher than the @C5 except for the @C10 - there are not 2 clubs out there higher than the @C5 so East's signal cannot be his lowest card from a 3-card club holding. |
pg| ***** 430 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3There are only a few possible holdings that East could have in clubs for which the @C5 would be the proper count signal. East could have a singleton @C5, of course, but in this case South was dealt more clubs than you were and you will not be able to hold up your @CA long enough to exhaust his supply of cards in that suit. You have to hope that East's @C5 is his highest card from a doubleton @C54 or @C53. |
pg| ***** 431 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3If East began with a doubleton @C54 or @C53, the @C5 would be the proper way for East to signal his even count in clubs. If East started with 2 clubs then South started with 3 clubs and you should hold up your @CA until the third round of the suit. |

pg| ***** 435 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|pc|c|at|The @C3 is the only club in the deck that is not accounted for and South leads that card to the next trick. This time you have to take your @CA, but that's ok. Your hold up play has done the job. |
pg| ***** 436 ***** |


pc|cac|at|The declarer is now out of clubs and he will need to find an entry to the dummy in some other suit in order to reach the 2 club winners that have been established there. |

pg| ***** 438 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|3|ht|d|at|^-{ Pay close attention to the discards that your partner makes! Each one of his discards sends
 you a message that you might find helpful. You cannot afford to ignore these messages! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 439 ***** |


ht|q|pc|s|tc|h|at|In this case your partner's discard is the @S5. The message that this discard conveys is sufficient to tell you how to defeat the contract. Did you get the message? |
pg| ***** 440 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The first question you should ask yourself is, "What kind of a signal is the @S5?". |
pg| ***** 441 ***** |


at|The answer is that the @S5 is a count signal (actually a remainder count signal since your partner has already played a spade). The @S5 is not an attitude signal because your partner already gave you an attitude signal toward spades when he followed suit to your opening lead in that suit. His @S5 is not an attempt to send you the same message again!|
pg| ***** 442 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3So your partner's @S5 is a remainder count signal, telling you whether he had an even or an odd number of spades left in his hand at the time that the @S5 was played. Can you tell if the @S5 is a high spade or a low spade? |
pg| ***** 443 ***** |


at|The @S5 has to be your partner's lowest spade. You have the @S2, your partner played the @S3 to the first trick, and your opening lead was the @S4. There are no spades lower than the @S5 that your partner could have.|
pg| ***** 444 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Therefore, it appears that East had an odd number of spades left in his hand at the time he played the @S5. |
pg| ***** 445 ***** |


tc|r|at|You should be able to use this information to figure out which card you should play to the next trick. |
pg| ***** 446 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Think about what is going on in the spade suit. You started with 5 spades and the dummy started with 2 spades. East played a spade to the first trick and his @S5 discard revealed that he had an odd number of spades left. That odd number has to be 3, meaning that East was dealt 4 spades to begin with. Thus, South was dealt 2 spades. Since South played a spade on the first trick, he must have only 1 spade left.|

nt|^b@2^z@3Once you knew your partner's count in spades, you were able to figure out the declarer's count in that suit. It became known that South was left with a singleton @SK. You used this knowledge to lead your @SA, dropping South's @SK. |

^-{  Count signals - Review and Exercises  }
^-|fp||at|
|cp||at|Count signals are the second type of defensive signals (after attitude signals) that we have now examined in detail. Here is a reminder of the basic purpose of using count signals when you and your partner find yourselves on defense:

|
pg| ***** 533 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Count signals are used to tell your partner whether you have an even 
 (2, 4, 6, or 8) or an odd (1, 3, 5, or 7) number of cards in a specific suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 534 ***** |


at|The reason why it can help a defender to know whether his partner has an even or an odd number of cards in a particular suit is that:

|
pg| ***** 535 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Defense becomes a lot easier when you can figure out the contents of the unseen hands! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 536 ***** |


at|The basic mechanics of how count signals work is described as follows:

|
pg| ***** 537 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Play a high card to show your partner that you have an even number of cards in that suit. 
 Play a low card to show your partner that you have an odd number of cards in that suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 538 ***** |


at|As we have seen, attitude signals make use of high and low cards (to send encouraging or discouraging messages). In order to avoid confusion, it is important that each partnership makes agreements about when various types of signals should apply.

|
pg| ***** 539 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ The situation in which a signal is played determines the type of signal that is being used. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 540 ***** |


tb||

nt|^b@2^z@3
There are 2 primary situations where count signals should be used:

|
pg| ***** 541 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ 1. Signal count when the declarer leads a suit from his hand or from the dummy. }

|
pg| ***** 542 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ 2. Signal count if your attitude toward a suit is already known. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 543 ***** |


at|There are 2 main dangers in using any type of signal. If a defender thinks that either of these dangers may be present in a given situation, usually he will be better off not to signal at all:

|
pg| ***** 544 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Winning tricks takes priority over giving accurate signals! Don't forget about things 
 like second hand low, third hand high, and splitting honors for the sake of signaling! }

|
pg| ***** 545 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ Both the declarer and your partner can see your signals. Knowing your count in a suit 
 will sometimes be more helpful to the declarer. Be careful about when you choose to signal! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 546 ***** |


at|The latter of these warnings is particularly relevant to count signals. There are 2 situations in particular where you should be reluctant to give a count signal:

|
pg| ***** 547 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Do not signal count if you know that this information will not be relevant to your partner. }

|
pg| ***** 548 ***** |


at|^-For example, you may know that your partner will have no important decisions to make for the rest of the play. If this is the case then he does not need to know your count!

|
pg| ***** 549 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Do not signal count if your partner already knows your count (perhaps from the bidding). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 550 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|n#|5|at|A reminder of some sound principles that apply regardless of the type of signal being given:

|
pg| ***** 551 ***** |


cs|1|
at|^-{ Always signal with the loudest card that you can afford to play. The clearer your signals are, 
 the more likely it will be that your partner will get the message that you are trying to convey! }

|
pg| ***** 552 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ Defenders are not always dealt the perfect spot cards for the signals that they want 
 to make. All they can do is signal as loudly as possible with the cards they were dealt. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 553 ***** |


at|In this section we briefly touched on the concept of intentionally making incorrect count signals on occasion. The term false count is used to describe this type of play.

|
pg| ***** 554 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ False count means deliberately using the wrong count signal on defense in an effort to 
 mislead declarer. The danger of giving false count is that your partner will also be misled! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 555 ***** |


at|We have also learned that the original guidelines that we established for when attitude signals should be used were not quite complete.

|
pg| ***** 556 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ When partner leads an Ace against a trump contract, offer him an encouraging 
 attitude signal if you have either the Queen or a doubleton in the suit that he led. }

|
pg| ***** 557 ***** |


at|^-You may find it easier to think of the concept of playing high from a doubleton in this situation as a form of count signal. Another way to look at this is to redefine attitude signals as follows:
|
pg| ***** 558 ***** |


n#|7|cs|1|at|^-{ An encouraging attitude signal means that you want partner to lead the suit
 that you encouraged, but it does not promise any specific holding in that suit. }

|
pg| ***** 559 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|n#|5|at|There are several reasons why it is a good idea for the defenders to use count signals when following to a trick in which the lead has come from either the declarer or the dummy's hand. Some of these we have seen already:

|
pg| ***** 560 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ Count signals can be used to tell your partner how many times he should hold up a winner.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 561 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Count signals can help your partner to know if he can safely discard from a given suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 562 ***** |


at|Be careful, however, when giving count in a suit that the declarer has led. He may be more interested in learning how many cards you have in this suit than your partner is! 

|
pg| ***** 563 ***** |


at|The other main situation for using count signals is when your attitude toward a suit is already known. Here is the theory behind why you should be giving count in such situations:

|
pg| ***** 564 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ If your partner already knows your attitude toward a suit, don't tell him again! Instead, 
 you should tell your partner something he does not know - your count in that suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 565 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ In general, you can only use each type of signal once in a given suit. In particular, once 
 you have given an attitude signal in a suit, the next signal in that suit is a count signal. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 566 ***** |


at|Saying that count signals apply when a player's attitude toward a suit is known makes a lot of sense, but it is not always easy to judge when this state of affairs really exists. Remember:
|
pg| ***** 567 ***** |


n#|7|cs|4|at|^-{Regardless of the set of principles that your partnership uses to define the situations in which
 the various types of signals apply, there will be some situations that slip through the cracks. }
^-|
pg| ***** 568 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|n#|5|at|Most of the time, when you give a count signal in a suit where your attitude is known, you have already played a card in that suit. Here are some reminders of how count signals work in these situations:

|
pg| ***** 569 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ When giving count in a suit in which you have already played a card, your signal describes 
 how many cards you have left in the suit (not how many cards you were dealt in the suit). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 570 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Bridge players use the terms present count, current count, and remainder count to 
 describe a count signal that is made after a card in that suit has been played. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 571 ***** |


at|Your first discard in a suit is an attitude signal and your second discard from the same suit tells your partner whether you have an even or an odd number of cards left in that suit. Some general thoughts on discards as signals:

|
pg| ***** 572 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Pay close attention to the discards that your partner makes! Each one of his discards sends
 you a message that you might find helpful. You cannot afford to ignore these messages! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 573 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ If you have to make a discard, that discard will be interpreted as a signal. Make 
 that signal count and tell your partner something that you think he needs to know! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 574 ***** |


at|Sometimes when the declarer is running a long suit, both defenders have to make several discards. This can be an uncomfortable situation for the defense, but by watching each others' discards the defenders can often work out which cards they should keep and which cards they can safely throw away. |
pg| ***** 575 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The main purpose of this section of the program has been to teach you about count signals, but in the course of these studies some other important lessons about signaling, defense, and bridge in general have also been presented:

|
pg| ***** 576 ***** |


cs|2|
at|^-{ In terms of signaling, spot cards like the 5 of a suit are not inherently high or low cards. 
 Consider all of the spot cards that you see before trying to interpret partner's signals. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 577 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Sometimes it is necessary for a defender to keep in mind that his 
 partner's signal may not be a signal at all - it may be a singleton! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 578 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ When a defender has to decide whether his partner was dealt a 
 singleton or a doubleton, in most cases a doubleton is more likely. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 579 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ When the defenders can ruff one of declarer's side suit winners, this 
 can be good for the defense even if the declarer is in a position to overruff. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 580 ***** |


at|The next 2 points are about the nature of the partnership aspect of defense. The first of these describes the right attitude toward handling a mistake that was made by you or your partner:

|
pg| ***** 581 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{It doesn't matter whose fault it was! Partners in bridge are on the same team. Getting involved
in the blame game is not helpful. What matters is that both partners learn from their mistakes!}
^-
|
pg| ***** 582 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ If a partnership is to be effective on defense, they must trust one another to have good 
 reasons for playing the cards that they do. Following your partner's lead is the way to go! }

nt|^b@2^z@3Discard the @H2 as a remainder count signal suggesting to your partner that you have an odd number of hearts left in your hand. Perhaps your partner will be able to use this information to help him figure out the contents of the unseen hands. This is a situation for using count signals because your @H6 discard told East your attitude toward hearts. There is no reason to give him the same message again!|

lb|*CWhich card would you play?^^s4^s42|



nt|^b@2^z@3Play the @S4. This is technically an attitude signal since your partner led an honor card. The @S4 is an encouraging attitude signal. Normally you would only encourage when you held what looked to be a relevant honor card of your own, but this situation is special. When your partner leads an Ace against a trump contract (suggesting that he has the King as well), encourage when you have either the Queen or a doubleton in that suit.|

lb|*CWhich card would you play?^^ct^cjt2|



nt|^b@2^z@3You should play the @C10. This is a situation where it is more important to split your honors than it is to give your partner a count signal. Recall that we split by playing the lowest card from a group of equals. |
pg| ***** 638 ***** |

pg| ***** 640 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The play of the @C2 would give the declarer a chance to play the @C9 from the dummy. If South decides to play the @C9, |

pg| ***** 648 ***** |


lb|*CWhich card would you play?^^d8^d8762|


nt|^b@2^z@3Play the @D8 as a count signal in order to tell your partner that you have an even number of diamonds. You would normally give an attitude signal when your partner leads a suit, but in this situation your attitude toward diamonds is known. If you had been dealt a diamond that could beat dummy's @D9 you would have played that card. |
pg| ***** 650 ***** |


md|0dqt3,dak5|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is one possible layout of the unseen diamonds |

pg| ***** 655 ***** |


at|The defense will then be able to score a third diamond trick with a spot card. |
pg| ***** 656 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose we move your @D6 to the declarer's hand. |
pg| ***** 657 ***** |


md|0d6|at|You will be left with an odd number of diamonds and the @D2 is now the correct count signal (instead of the @D8). |

pc|d3|
pg| ***** 660 ***** |

md|3,,ha6,hj542|



nt|^b@2^z@3You are sitting East. Assume that South opened the bidding with 1@H. North responded 1@S and South rebid 1NT which became the final contract. Your partner, West, led some other suit. The declarer won the first trick in the dummy and played the @HA. |

pc|ha|at|Which heart would you play as East in this position? |
pg| ***** 663 ***** |


lb|*CWhich card would you play?^^h2^hj542|

nt|^b@2^z@3
You should play the @H2 |
pg| ***** 665 ***** |


at|despite the fact that the @H5 is the correct count signal (the one you would make if you wanted to tell your partner that you were dealt an even number of hearts). Here you do not need to tell your partner how many hearts you were dealt because he knows this already! |
pg| ***** 666 ***** |


md|0hkqt83,h97|

nt|^b@2^z@3The bidding suggests that South was dealt exactly 5 hearts. If South had less than 5 hearts, he would not have opened the bidding in that suit. If he had more than 5 hearts, he would not have rebid 1NT. |
pg| ***** 667 ***** |


at|West knows that his own hand contains 2 hearts and that the dummy started with 2 hearts as well. |
pg| ***** 668 ***** |


at|Your partner is fully capable of working out all by himself that you have 4 hearts! |
pg| ***** 669 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose you do give an honest count signal in hearts by playing the @H5. |
pg| ***** 670 ***** |


pc|h5|at|South plays the @H3 |
pg| ***** 671 ***** |


pc|h3|at|and things will get even worse if your partner also signals the fact that he has an even number of hearts by playing the @H9. You already know your partner has 2 hearts so he does not need to tell you this!|

pg| ***** 675 ***** |


pc|h2|at|South has a guess to make. |
pg| ***** 676 ***** |


at|Playing the @H10 as a finesse against your @HJ is the winning play on the actual layout, |

pg| ***** 680 ***** |


md|0,,,hj|

nt|^b@2^z@3If left to his own devises, how would the declarer play this suit? If South knows the correct percentage play with this card combination, he will know that it is against the odds to finesse the @H10. |
pg| ***** 681 ***** |


up|5|at|However, if both defenders use honest count signals in hearts, |
pg| ***** 682 ***** |


pc|h5hh9|
pg| ***** 683 ***** |


at|South may decide to believe them. This may convince him to abandon his normal play in the heart suit and to finesse the @H10 instead. That is the last thing that the defenders would like to see!|
pg| ***** 684 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Both defenders already know how many hearts all 4 players were dealt. Thus, they should not signal their count in this suit. Both defenders should simply play their lowest hearts under dummy's @HA. You can think about this as either giving false count or as not signaling at all. |
pg| ***** 685 ***** |


at|The important point is to understand that giving honest count in this situation can only be helpful to the declarer. That is a good reason not to give honest count signals here!|

nt|^b@2^z@3You should play the @S2 in this situation. |
pg| ***** 691 ***** |


at|The case for playing the @S7 as a count signal to show an even number of spades |
pg| ***** 692 ***** |


at|is that your partner's lead of the @SA shows that he has the @SK as well and that both of the defenders can see the @SQ in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 693 ***** |


at|^^^^East cannot have a relevant honor card in spades so his attitude in that suit is already known. East should therefore give count by playing the @S7. |
pg| ***** 694 ***** |


md|0st65,k943|

nt|^b@2^z@3
The flaw with this reasoning is that East should play his highest spade in this situation when he has a doubleton |
pg| ***** 695 ***** |


at|so that he can let West know that he can get a spade ruff when the remaining spades are distributed as you can now see above. |
pg| ***** 696 ***** |


md|0,,,s65|

nt|^b@2^z@3If East gives count in spades in this situation when he has 4 cards in that suit, the next trick won't be pretty for the defense. |
pg| ***** 697 ***** |


pc|s7|at|South will play his singleton @S10, |
pg| ***** 698 ***** |


pc|st|
pg| ***** 699 ***** |


at|but West won't know that the @S10 was a singleton. He will continue with the @SK, expecting to win this trick and then to give his partner a ruff. |
pg| ***** 700 ***** |


pc|sk|at|^^^^West will be surprised when South ruffs his @SK and creates a spade winner in the dummy which may be useful for taking care of one of the declarer's losers. |
pg| ***** 701 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3The defense can avoid this unpleasant fate if East properly plays the @S2 on the first trick. West will not know how many spades his partner was dealt, but he will know that East was not dealt a doubleton spade. ^^^^Given that there is no possibility of a defensive ruff in the spade suit, West will probably switch to a different suit at trick 2 which rates to be good for the defense.
