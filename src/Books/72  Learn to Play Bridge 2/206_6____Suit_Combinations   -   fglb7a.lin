nt|^z@3^b@2
The key to making the contract in the deal you just played is to avoid losing a trump trick with the suit combination shown above (that is, a 10-card fit in which the King is the only relevant missing card).|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
There are 2 possible ways to play this suit. The declarer could either finesse West for the @SK or he could play the @SA on the first round of the suit in the hope that the @SK is singleton. Let's try to compare these 2 plans by examining various possible layouts of the East-West spades. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


md|0,s76,,sk|nt|^b@2^z@3
Playing the @SA on the first round of this suit will be a big success if East was dealt a singleton @SK.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |

This play will also work if West was dealt a singleton @SK, but the alternative plan of the spade finesse will work in this case as well.|md|0,sk,,s76|

a doubleton @SK7, |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


md|0,s6|nt|^b@2^z@3
or all 3 missing spades. Therefore, the finesse gains in 3 cases, |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |

and loses in only 1 case (when East has a singleton @SK). |

at|In some of the explanations of correct percentage plays of the suit combinations that will be presented, the details of all of the winning and losing cases of the various plans will not be given. They were shown here in case you are curious about how these problems can be solved.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


md|0s27,st,sj|ha|y|nt|^b@2^z@3
Here is a slightly different suit combination. The defenders have been given the @S10 and the @SQ and the @SJ are now split between the North-South hands (they were both in the South hand before). It is still correct to finesse West for the missing @SK, but the declarer has to be careful in regard to how he goes about this. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Suppose the declarer starts by leading a small spade from his hand and that West follows with the @S6. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


pc|s2s6|nt|^b@2^z@3
The @SJ is played from the dummy as a finesse against the @SK. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|sj|md|0,,,h2|nt|^b@2^z@3
East will need something to discard so let's give him a heart to play to this trick. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


pc|h2|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The finesse wins, but West's remaining @SK10 surrounds South's @SQ. There is no way to prevent West from coming to a spade trick (he would cover with the @SK if South tried to lead the @SQ next). |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


up|4|nt|^b@2^z@3
This problem can be avoided if South leads the @SQ (instead of a small spade) on the first round of the suit. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


up|3|nt|^b@2^z@3
If West covers an honor with an honor by playing the @SK when the @SQ is led from the South hand, the dummy's @SA wins the trick. |

wt|s|nt|^b@2^z@3
He can return to his hand in some other suit and lead the @S9, the @S8, or the @S7 through West. Regardless of whether or not West covers with the @S10, he will not win a trick in this suit. |

ht|q|at|Leading an honor card (the @SQ in this case) is a safety play against a layout where the finesse is working, but the suit is divided 3-0. |

pg| ***** 43 ***** |


pc|s6|md|0,,,sk|nt|^b@2^z@3

ht|l|at|If you are mathematically inclined (if you are not then please do skip this paragraph!), you may be curious as to why this suit combination is not a pure guess since both the finesse and playing the @SA gain in exactly 1 case. The reason is that all cases are not equally likely to have been dealt. |

For the declarer to succeed in his 7NT contract in the deal that you just played, he has to avoid losing a trick from the spade suit shown above. 

The nice thing about this suit combination is that the correct play makes it possible to win 5 tricks regardless of the layout of the East-West cards in the suit. That was not the case for the first card combination that we studied in this chapter (a 10-card fit missing the King).|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^B@2
The correct play is to win the first trick with either the @SK or the @SQ. 

The only problem that could arise is if one of the defenders was dealt all 4 outstanding spades (if both defenders follow to the first round of spades, the rest will be easy since all of their spades will fall under the @SA, the @SK, and the @SQ).|

nt|^b@2^z@3
The declarer is faced with a similar problem to that in the previous deal. He has to avoid losing a spade trick in order to succeed in 7NT. 
|n^|5|at|
The difference between this spade suit and the spade suit in the previous exercise is that the @S10 (in addition to 
the @SJ) is missing now. This missing card, even though it is ^*Ionly^*N a 10, has a dramatic impact on the way that this suit combination should be played.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
We have seen that when a 9-card fit is present and only the Jack is missing, the declarer can ensure that no tricks will be lost by winning the first round of the suit in the hand that was dealt 2 high honor cards. 

Let's see what happens when the 10 is also missing and the declarer tries to follow the same plan by leading either the @SK or the @SQ from his hand. |

The best the declarer can do is to cross to the dummy in some other suit in order to lead a low spade. |

up|8|nt|^b@2^z@3
The bottom line is that winning the first trick with the @SK or the @SQ (the play that worked so well when the declarer held the @S10) will never work when either of the defenders was dealt all 4 missing spades. |
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


wt|n|nt|^b@2^z@3
Let's consider the implications of the alternative plan of winning the first trick with the dummy's @SA. |

West discards on the first round of spades |

nt|^b@2^z@3
and the declarer thereby learns that East still has 3 spades headed by the @SJ and the @S10. |
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^b@2^B@2
A spade is led from the dummy and South wins the trick as East splits his honors (his best defense). |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


pc|s2stskh3|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


wt|n|nt|^b@2^z@3
A finessing position now exists over East's remaining spade honor. The declarer has to get back to the dummy, but once he does so he will be able to pick up the rest of East's spades. |
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


up|8|md|3skq98,,sa5432,jt76|nt|^b@2^z@3
So if the first trick in this suit is won with dummy's @SA, the declarer can avoid losing a trick when East was dealt all 4 outstanding spades. |

md|3skq98,sjt76,sa5432,|nt|^b@2^z@3
If it turns out that West was dealt 4 spades, the play of the @SA will not help, but there is nothing that the declarer could have done to prevent the loss of a trick on this layout. |

The percentage play in this suit is to finesse the @H10 on the second round. It may have occurred to you that this claim contradicts 9 never (since the recommended play amounts to taking a second round finesse with a 9-card fit). 

It turns out that it takes some relatively complex mathematical reasoning (using something called the principle of restricted choice) to demonstrate that it is indeed correct to finesse the @H10 in the position shown above.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
It is beyond the scope of this program to try to explain the principle of restricted choice. That is probably just as well since 99% of the intended audience of this program would likely find such an explanation to be either uninteresting or confusing. 

If you fall into the other 1% of bridge players who has a serious interest in math, there are plenty of bridge books which attempt to explain the principle of restricted choice and show other suit combinations in which this applies.|

This is another example of a suit combination that arises with considerable frequency. Despite how common it is, many bridge players do not know the correct percentage play. |

nt|^b@2^z@3
There are quite a number of reasonable ways that you could go about playing this suit. The calculations that would be required to compare the various lines of play are too complex to deal with at the table and they will not be presented here. The correct percentage play will be stated, but no attempt to justify this play will be made. 

You will just have to accept this claim on faith (or try to work it out yourself if you are so inclined).|

Now let's return to the question of whether the declarer should start by leading the @SQ or a lower spade from his hand. Superficially it doesn't look like it should matter since the declarer's plan should be to take 2 finesses. 

Regardless of the spade he leads to the first trick, he will hold his losers in this suit to 1 as long as West was dealt either the @SK or the @SJ. |

The purpose of this chapter was to teach you the best percentage play for various suit combinations that occur frequently at the table. In some of these suit combinations, the correct solution can be arrived at through common sense. In others, at least some mathematics is required to come up with the best percentage play.
|n#|9|at|Most serious bridge players attempt to memorize the percentage plays of common suit combinations rather than figure them out each time they arise in practice. Memorizing the correct way to play various suits is not a skill that comes naturally to a lot of bridge players. It takes practice and experience to become good at this. Hopefully this chapter has provided you with some of the practice you will need in this area!
|n#|9|at|While it was never said so explicitly, the suit combination problems that appeared in the deals that you played were more or less ^*iin a vacuum^*N. This means that the only real consideration in each of the deals that you played was the best way to play one key suit.
|n#|9|at|Most real life bridge deals are not like that. In most cases, factors like entries, consideration of the opponent's bidding (or lack thereof), and the danger of the opponent's winning tricks with ruffs must be considered. On some deals these factors will be enough to make what would normally be the correct percentage play in a given suit the incorrect play in the context of a full deal.
|n#|9|at|Regardless, the study of card combinations is useful not only because these problems do sometimes occur ^*iin a vacuum^*N, but also because learning to think about these problems will make you better at thinking about bridge in general!
