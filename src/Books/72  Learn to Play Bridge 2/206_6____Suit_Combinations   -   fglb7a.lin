^-{  Introduction to   ^*B8 ever^*N  and  ^*B9 never^*N  }
^-|cp||fp||at|
The original ^*B Learn to Play Bridge ^*N program presented a lot of suit combinations from the declarer's point of view, but most of these were used to explain how extra winners could be developed using techniques like promotion and finessing. You are going to encounter a lot of different suit combinations in your career as a bridge player and many of these will lend themselves to simple analysis.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

There are several suit combinations in which the declarer has 2 or more reasonable plays available to win the number of tricks he requires from the suit. In Learn to Play Bridge, you were presented with a famous bridge maxim that can be used to help you remember the correct percentage play in 2 very common suit combinations: 8 ever, 9 never.
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


n#|5|cs|4|at|^B{|ih|phakJt|at|}
^B|n^|f|at|{|ih|ph5432|at|}
|ht|n|at|^f   @2The 8 ever part of this maxim means that if you are the declarer and you need to play an 8-card fit missing only the Queen for no losers, the percentage play is to finesse against the Queen. Ideally, either the Ace or King should be cashed first in case the Queen is singleton.


|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ht|s|at|^B@2The alternative play of cashing the Ace and King in the hope that the Queen will fall is inferior. That play will work some of the time when the 8 ever play of finessing against the Queen would have failed, but the reverse is more likely to be the case. That is why 8 ever is said to be the correct percentage play with this card combination.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
|cs|3|at|^B {|ih|phakJt|at|}
^B|n^|t|at|{|ih|ph65432|at|}
|ht|b|n#|4|at|^g@2If an extra card is added to the 8 ever suit combination, then 9 never will apply. With a 9-card fit missing only the Queen, the correct percentage play is to lead out the Ace and King in the hope that the Queen will drop. The alternative play of finessing against the Queen on the second round is slightly less likely to succeed.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ht|e|n#|3|at|^b@2^^Fortunately, "8 ever, 9 never" has a nice rhyme to it. This is a good thing because the math that is needed to demonstrate why 8 ever and 9 never are both correct percentage plays is too difficult for almost all bridge players to even think of doing at the table. Having a catchy phrase to remind us of the correct plays in these situations makes our lives easier!

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|i|n#|8|at|^b@2There are a lot of other suit combinations in which the declarer has a choice of plays that he could make. It would be nice if there were maxims like 8 ever, 9 never to help you to remember how to play these suit combinations, but that is not the case. In some suit combinations, it is possible to figure out the correct play without doing any math at all, but for other suit combinations it would not be practical to try to figure out the best percentage play at the table.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


ht|m|n#|3|at|Most serious bridge players have made some effort to try to memorize the correct percentage play for various common suit combinations. For most card combinations, the correct play is not hard to remember after you have seen it once. The purpose of this chapter is to teach you the percentage plays of some suit combinations that you will encounter on a regular basis. Don't worry about having to learn or use any math here. Being able to pay close attention and to think logically are the only skills that you are going to require here!|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


cp|red|n#|c|AT|
^B@2^*bHoward Schtuzman:^*n |cp||at|"The "8 ever, 9 never" phrase (e.g you should play for the drop as opposed to finessing for the queen) is, at best, very misleading, and, in fact, often wrong. It is true that, absent any additional information, the play for the drop is very slightly better than finessing. And I do mean "very slightly". It is only 1%-2%. So, first of all, if you decide you always want to finesse, in the long run you will do just about as well as those people who play for the drop. Of course, you should always cash the A or K first before finessing, because a little over 10% of the time the queen will be singleton. 
|n^|5|at|
But, more importantly, second of all is that key phrase "absent any additional information". Quite often you have additional information based on the bidding or the play of the cards prior to your drawing trump. If you find out that one opponent has a 5-card or longer suit, it is a much better percentage to finesse the other opponent for the queen. The reason for that is as follows. Since you already know 5 or more cards in one opponent's hand do not include the missing queen, it becomes much more likely that the other hand, where there are more unknown cards, contains the missing queen."|

nt|^z@3^b@2
The key to making the contract in the deal you just played is to avoid losing a trump trick with the suit combination shown above (that is, a 10-card fit in which the King is the only relevant missing card).|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
There are 2 possible ways to play this suit. The declarer could either finesse West for the @SK or he could play the @SA on the first round of the suit in the hope that the @SK is singleton. Let's try to compare these 2 plans by examining various possible layouts of the East-West spades. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


md|0,s76,,sk|nt|^b@2^z@3
Playing the @SA on the first round of this suit will be a big success if East was dealt a singleton @SK.|

pg| ***** 25 ***** |


md|0s27,st,sj|ha|y|nt|^b@2^z@3
Here is a slightly different suit combination. The defenders have been given the @S10 and the @SQ and the @SJ are now split between the North-South hands (they were both in the South hand before). It is still correct to finesse West for the missing @SK, but the declarer has to be careful in regard to how he goes about this. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

Suppose the declarer starts by leading a small spade from his hand and that West follows with the @S6. |

The finesse wins, but West's remaining @SK10 surrounds South's @SQ. There is no way to prevent West from coming to a spade trick (he would cover with the @SK if South tried to lead the @SQ next). |

For the declarer to succeed in his 7NT contract in the deal that you just played, he has to avoid losing a trick from the spade suit shown above. 

The nice thing about this suit combination is that the correct play makes it possible to win 5 tricks regardless of the layout of the East-West cards in the suit. That was not the case for the first card combination that we studied in this chapter (a 10-card fit missing the King).|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^B@2
The correct play is to win the first trick with either the @SK or the @SQ. 

The only problem that could arise is if one of the defenders was dealt all 4 outstanding spades (if both defenders follow to the first round of spades, the rest will be easy since all of their spades will fall under the @SA, the @SK, and the @SQ).|

The declarer is faced with a similar problem to that in the previous deal. He has to avoid losing a spade trick in order to succeed in 7NT.

The difference between this spade suit and the spade suit in the previous exercise is that the @S10 (in addition to 
the @SJ) is missing now. This missing card, even though it is ^*Ionly^*N a 10, has a dramatic impact on the way that this suit combination should be played.|

We have seen that when a 9-card fit is present and only the Jack is missing, the declarer can ensure that no tricks will be lost by winning the first round of the suit in the hand that was dealt 2 high honor cards.

The percentage play in this suit is to finesse the @H10 on the second round. It may have occurred to you that this claim contradicts 9 never (since the recommended play amounts to taking a second round finesse with a 9-card fit). 

It turns out that it takes some relatively complex mathematical reasoning (using something called the principle of restricted choice) to demonstrate that it is indeed correct to finesse the @H10 in the position shown above.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
It is beyond the scope of this program to try to explain the principle of restricted choice. That is probably just as well since 99% of the intended audience of this program would likely find such an explanation to be either uninteresting or confusing. 

If you fall into the other 1% of bridge players who has a serious interest in math, there are plenty of bridge books which attempt to explain the principle of restricted choice and show other suit combinations in which this applies.|

While we are on the subject, it should be noted that the same percentage play applies to a 10-card fit (and an 8-card fit) when the Ace and Queen are the only missing relevant cards:

Let's return to the original 9-card fit that we have been studying in order to note an interesting concept of defensive strategy and how the cards that the defenders choose to play should influence the declarer's plan.
|
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Suppose that when South leads the first round of diamonds, |
pg| ***** 220 ***** |

West chooses to win the trick with his @DA. |

pg| ***** 223 ***** |

and West follows small. |
pg| ***** 224 ***** |


pc|d6|nt|^b@2^z@3
The question is, "should the declarer play the @DK or a low diamond from the dummy when West plays this way?" |
pg| ***** 225 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The correct play is to finesse West for the @DQ. The reason is that the best percentage play involved finessing West for the @DQ and the declarer should not allow West's decision to play the @DA on the first round of the suit alter his strategy. The declarer's plan was always going to work when West was dealt the @DQ |
pg| ***** 226 ***** |

and it was only going to fail when East was dealt that card. |

Here is the lesson to be learned from this:

Succeeding in the 6@S contract in the hand you just played involves losing no more than 1 trump trick from the suit combination shown above (that is, a 4-4 fit missing only the King and Jack).

This is another example of a suit combination that arises with considerable frequency. Despite how common it is, many bridge players do not know the correct percentage play. |

nt|^b@2^z@3
There are quite a number of reasonable ways that you could go about playing this suit. The calculations that would be required to compare the various lines of play are too complex to deal with at the table and they will not be presented here. The correct percentage play will be stated, but no attempt to justify this play will be made. 

You will just have to accept this claim on faith (or try to work it out yourself if you are so inclined).|

Now let's return to the question of whether the declarer should start by leading the @SQ or a lower spade from his hand. Superficially it doesn't look like it should matter since the declarer's plan should be to take 2 finesses. 

Regardless of the spade he leads to the first trick, he will hold his losers in this suit to 1 as long as West was dealt either the @SK or the @SJ. |

The purpose of this chapter was to teach you the best percentage play for various suit combinations that occur frequently at the table. In some of these suit combinations, the correct solution can be arrived at through common sense. In others, at least some mathematics is required to come up with the best percentage play.
|n#|9|at|Most serious bridge players attempt to memorize the percentage plays of common suit combinations rather than figure them out each time they arise in practice. Memorizing the correct way to play various suits is not a skill that comes naturally to a lot of bridge players. It takes practice and experience to become good at this. Hopefully this chapter has provided you with some of the practice you will need in this area!
|n#|9|at|While it was never said so explicitly, the suit combination problems that appeared in the deals that you played were more or less ^*iin a vacuum^*N. This means that the only real consideration in each of the deals that you played was the best way to play one key suit.
|n#|9|at|Most real life bridge deals are not like that. In most cases, factors like entries, consideration of the opponent's bidding (or lack thereof), and the danger of the opponent's winning tricks with ruffs must be considered. On some deals these factors will be enough to make what would normally be the correct percentage play in a given suit the incorrect play in the context of a full deal.
|n#|9|at|Regardless, the study of card combinations is useful not only because these problems do sometimes occur ^*iin a vacuum^*N, but also because learning to think about these problems will make you better at thinking about bridge in general!

{If you can afford to lose 1 trick from a 4-4 fit in which the Queen and 10 are missing and
 the Ace-King are split, start by cashing the high honor from the hand that has the Jack. 
 Next, lead low toward the other high honor and finesse against the 10 if necessary. }|
