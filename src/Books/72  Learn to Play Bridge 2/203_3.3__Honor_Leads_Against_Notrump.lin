^-{ Honor leads against notrump contracts (revisited) }
^-|fp||cp||at|
Chapter 2 included an introduction to the concept of standard leads. We learned that if a partnership makes agreements to always lead the same card from the same holding in the same situation then their defense will be more effective as a result. Standard leads is a collection of such agreements. The agreements (with minor variations) are used by the vast majority of the world's bridge players - that's what makes them ^*Istandard^*N!

If you were paying very close attention to the first chapter of this program, you may have noticed that the standard leads against notrump contracts from a particular class of holdings were (intentionally) not described:

|
qx|3.3|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ You were not told what card to lead against notrump from holdings headed by the Ace-King! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|There is a good reason why standard leads from such holdings were omitted from the first chapter of this program. It is impossible to understand these leads without a sound knowledge of both attitude and count signals. You didn't know about these signals in the chapter on opening leads, but you know about them now!

Here is some good news about what you will learn in this section:
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


cs|3|at|
^-{ You are not going to have to unlearn anything that you have learned about opening leads.
 The lessons presented here will augment (not replace) the lessons that you learned already. }
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


tb||

nt|^b@2^z@3|n#|5|at|There are 2 reasons why you might choose an opening lead from a suit headed by the Ace-King against a notrump contract:

|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ 1. If you have a long and strong suit of your own headed by the Ace-King, you would
 select your opening lead from that suit with the hope of winning several tricks. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ |ih|psakqt9|at| }
^-
There is a good chance that you will be able to win the first 5 tricks by leading this suit.

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ 2. If you have a relatively short suit headed by the Ace-King, you may want to select this suit 
 for your opening lead in the hope that your partner has length and/or strength in it. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ |ih|phak4|at| }
^-
If your partner has the right heart holding, leading this suit could work out well.
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Consider what you would like to know when you lead from these holdings against notrump:

|cs|3|ht|d|at|^B{ |ih|psakqt9|at| }
|ht|d|at|^G@2When you lead this suit against notrump you would like your partner to play the @SJ if he has it. You will then know that the suit will run. If your partner does not have the @SJ, you would like him to give you a count signal. You will then be able to figure out the declarer's count in spades. If the @SJ is not in the dummy and not in your partner's hand, knowing how many spades the declarer was dealt will be very useful!

|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|3|ht|l|at|^B  { |ih|phak4|at| }
|ht|m|at|^G@2When you lead this suit against notrump you would like to know your partner's attitude toward hearts. If you can get your partner to give an attitude signal, you will continue leading hearts if he encourages, but you can switch your attack to a different suit if he discourages.
^b@2

|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Sometimes when you lead from a suit headed by the Ace-King against notrump you want
 to know your partner's attitude. Other times you want to know your partner's count. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Since the Ace and King are equals it makes sense that leading one of these cards against
 notrump asks for an attitude signal and leading the other card asks for a count signal. }
^-

pg| ***** 12 ***** |

 a count signal and the lead of the King to ask for an attitude signal. }

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is an example. Suppose that you are the opening leader against a notrump contract and that you were fortunate enough to have been dealt the powerful spade holding that we have been talking about. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|^^^^The standard lead from this holding is the @SA. By leading the @SA you tell your partner that you are hoping to run the spade suit and that you need some information from him that will help you to do so. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3In particular, you would like your partner to play any spade honor that he might have been dealt. In this case the @SJ is the only missing honor card. If your partner does not have the @SJ, he should try to tell you how many spades he was dealt by giving a count signal. Let's see how this might work in practice. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|pc|sa|md|0,,s4|at|Suppose the dummy has a singleton in spades. Whether or not you will be able to win the first 5 spade tricks depends on the layout of the rest of the cards in the suit. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


md|0s8752,,,sj63|at|On this distribution of the remaining spades, |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|your partner has the only relevant missing high card in spades - the @SJ. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|^^^^After the singleton @S4 is played from the dummy, |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|s|at|East should drop his @SJ in order to let his partner know he was dealt that card. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3East should not worry about throwing away such a big spade. He should trust his partner's opening lead of the @SA. West would not have led the @SA unless his spades were strong enough to be able to handle having East follow suit with an honor card! |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


pc|sj|at|^^^^South follows suit with the @S2 and West's @SA wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|s2|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|With the @SJ gone, West knows that he can run the rest of his spades without interruption. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


up|2|

nt|^b@2^z@3In the introduction to this section, it was stated that the lead of an Ace against a notrump contract is a request for a count signal. As we just saw, there is more to it than that:

|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ The opening lead of an Ace against a notrump contract asks for the partner of the 
 opening leader to play an honor card if possible and to otherwise give a count signal. }
|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3We just saw how, when the opening leader against notrump is dealt a very strong holding headed by the Ace-King, it will be helpful to him if his partner plays an honor card under his lead of the Ace. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


md|0sj,,,s82|at|^^^^The spades that West cannot see have now been moved around such that South has the @SJ |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|and such that East now has 4 cards in spades. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
East does not have a spade honor to play anymore. Instead, he should signal his count in spades by playing the @S8 (since he has an even number of spades). |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


pc|s8|at|The declarer follows suit with the @S5 and West's @SA wins the first trick. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


pc|s5|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3A little arithmetic will tell West what he needs to know. West started with 5 spades and the dummy started with 1 spade. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|East's @S8 gave the message that he started with an even number of spades. If that even number was 4, |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|then South was dealt exactly 3 spades. South has already played a spade so he would be left with 2 spades including the @SJ (because East would have played the @SJ on the first trick if he was dealt that card). |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3West will know that if he takes his @SK and @SQ then both of South's remaining spades will fall. With the @SJ out of the way, |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|there will be nothing to stop West from winning tricks with his @S10 and @S9. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


up|2|at|Once again the lead of the @SA gets the job done. In this case East's count signal is all that West needs in order to know that he can run his suit. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


md|0s63|

nt|^b@2^z@3What if East's @S8 was his highest card from a doubleton? After all, 2 is just as even a number as 4 is - East could easily have been dealt 2 spades when he plays his @S8. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


pc|s8|at|The bad news for the defense is that on this layout, South's 5 spades including the @SJ constitute a stopper and there is nothing that the defenders can do about that. The only good news for the defense is that no system of leads or signals would have performed any better on this layout!|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3When East signals that he has an even number of spades by playing the @S8 to the first trick, |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|West may consider the possibility that his partner was dealt a small doubleton in spades (leaving 5 spades to the @SJ with the declarer). If West does think about this layout he will realize that there is not much that he can do about it. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


md|0,,,s63|at|He might as well hope that East's @S8 was from a 4-card holding (leaving 3 spades to the @SJ with the declarer). |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3It will not impact his defense, but it might give West some comfort to know that on most deals it is more likely that the 7 missing spades are distributed in an relatively balanced way (with East having 4 spades and South having 3 spades) |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


md|0s63|at|rather than in a more unbalanced way (with South having 5 spades and East having 2 spades). The bidding will often tell West if it is really possible that South has 5 spades. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


md|0,,,s6|

nt|^b@2^z@3Finally, suppose that East has 3 small spades (leaving the declarer with 4 spades headed by the @SJ). |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|East does not have a spade honor to play so he should give count with the @S2 to tell his partner that he holds an odd number of spades. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|s2|at|South follows suit with the @S3 as West's @SA wins the first trick. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


pc|s3|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3It does not take much in the way of math for West to realize that if his partner started with 3 spades |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


At|then South started with 4 spades. South must have 3 spades left in this case and one of these spades is the @SJ (since East would have played the @SJ on the first trick if he had been dealt that card). |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|West will know that if he cashes his @SK and @SQ, the declarer will play his 2 remaining small spades on these tricks. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|South will be left with the @SJ to stop West's spades. |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3It is probably a good idea for West to play 1 more high spade. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


pc|sk|md|0,,h2|at|The dummy now has a card to discard on this trick. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


pc|H2|md|0,,,75|at|If it turns out that the odd number of spades that East started with was 5, West will have a pleasant surpise on this trick. South will have only 1 spade left and that spade will have to be the @SJ. The @SJ will fall |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


pc|ss|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|and West will know that he can run the rest of his suit. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


up|2|md|0s75|

nt|^b@2^z@3In the more likely event that the odd number of spades that East was dealt was 3, both he and the declarer will follow suit with low spades. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|ss|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


At|West will now have to choose between cashing his remaining high spade (knowing that this will set up South's @SJ) |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


wt|e|at|and switching to another suit in the hope that East will gain the lead. If East leads his remaining spade later in the play, |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


pc|s|At|West will be able to run his suit without giving South a trick with the @SJ after all. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


md|2sj753,sqkat9,s4,s862|pc|!sa!s4|

nt|^b@2^z@3So once again, the count signal that West elicits from his partner by leading the @SA provides the exact information that West needs. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


pc|ss|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


At|In this case West learns that South has a possible spade stopper. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


wt|e|at|West may well try to get his partner on lead for a future spade play from the opposite side of the table. If East is able to lead a spade at some point in the play, |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


pc|s8|at|the possibility of declarer's @SJ acting as a stopper will go up in smoke!|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


md|2,hak4|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now let's take a look at the other side of the coin. Assume that West chooses hearts for his opening lead against a notrump contract. West has only 3 cards in hearts and since every bridge hand contains at least one suit with at least 4 cards, hearts cannot be West's longest suit. Perhaps the opponents have bid West's longest suit and, among the unbid suits, West's heart holding looks to be the most promising.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Leading the @HA from this holding would be a mistake. Remember that if you lead the @HA, your partner will think that you have a much longer and stronger holding in hearts. He will play an honor card on the first trick if he has one and that is unlikely to be a good thing for the defense. |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


at|Don't even think of leading the @H4 from this holding! By leading a heart you are hoping that your partner has something good in this suit. Leading the @H4 rates to block the heart suit in this case. |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The @HK is the proper heart to lead. You need to know how much your partner likes hearts. That is exactly what you will learn when you lead the @HK because your partner will give you an attitude signal. |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


pc|hk|md|0hjt2,,h85,hq9763|

at|Sometimes you will strike gold when you make an opening lead against notrump from a holding like @HAK4. Here, for example, you partner will be thrilled by your lead. |
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|He will express his attitude with an encouraging @H9. |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


pc|hh9h|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Inspired by his partner's encouraging attitude signal, West will know to cash the @HA next. |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


pc|hah|at|Not that it is likely to make a difference here, but the proper heart for East to play on the second round of the suit is the @H7 - a remainder count signal to suggest that East has an even number of hearts left in his hand. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


pc|h7h|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


at|West leads his @H4 to the next trick. |
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


pc|H4|md|0,,s2|at|The dummy will discard |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


pc|s|at|and East's @HQ will take care of the declarer's last heart. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


pc|hqh|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


at|East is left on lead with 2 more heart winners. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


md|2hhqj9,hak4,ht6,h87532|



nt|^b@2^z@3Here is another layout of the heart suit where, when West leads the @HK to ask East for an attitude signal, |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


pc|hkh6|at|East should seriously consider encouraging despite the fact that he has no honors in hearts (particularly if East doesn't want his partner to switch to any other suit). It is far less obvious for East to encourage here than it was when his 5-card heart suit was headed by the @HQ, but there is still a good chance that hearts is the best suit for the defense to be playing.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose East encourages with the @H8 |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


pc|h8|at|and South follows with the @H9 as West's @HK wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


pc|h9|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


at|West will continue with the @HA |
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


pc|hah|at|and, as before, East should signal that his remainder count in hearts is even. |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


pc|H7h|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


at|The @H4 is led next. |
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


pc|h4|md|0,,s2|at|The dummy discards |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


pc|s|at|and East follows |
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


pc|h2|at|as South wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


pc|hq|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


wt|e|at|The declarer's hearts were too strong for the defense to run the suit, but if East regains the lead he will be able to cash 2 more tricks in hearts. |
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


md|2hhqj9,hak4,ht6,h87532|pc|!hk!h|

nt|^b@2^z@3When you have a holding like East has in hearts and your partner leads the King of that suit against a notrump contract, |
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


at|there are times when you should discourage. In this case, if East wanted to discourage hearts, he would play his lowest heart (the @H2) as an attitude signal. Can you think of a reason why East might want to discourage his partner from continuing hearts in this situation? |
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Although East has a fairly high opinion of the heart suit, |
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


md|0,,ck6,caqjt9|at|it is possible that he has a much higher opinion of some other suit. For example, suppose that East has a solid club suit missing only the @CK and that the @CK is part of a doubleton in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


at|Here East should play the @H2 under West's @HK as a discouraging attitude signal. |
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


pc|hh|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


md|0,c3|

nt|^b@2^z@3East must hope that his partner will get his message about hearts and try another suit instead. If West figures out to play a club, |
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


pc|c|at|East will win the next 5 tricks in that suit, regardless of whether or not the @CK is played from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


up|3|at|East's @H2 does not ask West to play a club - it just says he would like West to stop playing hearts. |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


at|East must hope that the bidding and/or the sight of the dummy will be enough to let West know that clubs is the suit that East is hoping for. |
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|d|cs|2|at|^-{ When your partner leads a King against notrump, discourage when you have a
 moderate holding in the suit he led if you would rather that he switch to a different suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


ht|p|at|East does not exactly hate hearts, |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


At|but he should discourage in that suit |
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


at|in the hope that West will switch to a club at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


md|2hhqj9,hak4,ht6,h87532|pc|!hk!h|


nt|^b@2^z@3In almost all of the examples of attitude signals that we have seen so far, both discouraging and encouraging signals carry a message about the suit of the signal itself (typically as to whether or not the signaler holds a relevant honor card in that suit). When your partner leads a King against a notrump contract, the nature of the message of the attitude signal that you give is slightly different.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|4|ht|d|at|^-{ When your partner leads a King against notrump your attitude signal should tell him if 
 you want him to continue the suit he led, not whether you have a relevant honor in the suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


ht|p|at|In this situation an encouraging attitude signal asks your partner to continue the suit while a discouraging attitude signal suggests that you would prefer that he switch to a different suit. |
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Sometimes a defender has to use his judgment in deciding whether to encourage or discourage when his partner leads a King against a notrump contract. If it is not immediately obvious that it will be good for the defense for the opening leader to continue the suit that he led, factors such as the bidding and the other cards in the dummy can sometimes help. On some deals, the partner of the opening leader must guess if he should encourage or discourage.|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


md|2hqjt5,hak4,h963,h872|


nt|^b@2^z@3Here is an example of a situation where it should be obvious for the partner of the opening leader to discourage. West leads the @HK against a notrump contract |
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


pc|hk|at|and the @H3 is played from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


pc|h3|at|East's heart holding is neither long nor strong |
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


at|so he should play his lowest heart (the @H2) as a discouraging attitude signal. |
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


pc|H2|at|South plays the @H5 and West's @HK wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


pc|h5|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3If West were to lead the @HA to the next trick, |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


pc|hahhh|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


at|he would be doing the declarer's work for him. South is left with 2 winning hearts and the defense has no future in this suit at all. |
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


up|4|at|East's discouraging attitude signal on the first trick should be sufficient to prevent West from leading the @HA to the second trick. Hopefully, West will be able to find another suit to play that offers better prospects for the defense. |

We have learned that against a notrump contract, the lead of an Ace asks the partner of the opening leader to drop an honor card if he has one and to otherwise give a count signal. 

The lead of a King against notrump is a request for an attitude signal. One question we have not explored is when the opening leader should lead an Ace, when he should lead a King, and when he should lead a smaller card when both the Ace and King are held.

at|Since the partner of the opening leader is supposed to drop an honor card when an Ace is led against notrump, it makes sense that the Ace should only be led from suits that are close to solid. For example:^^

pg| ***** 128 ***** |


cs|3|at|^B{ |ih|psakqt4|at|} |n#|g|at|^G{ |ih|phakjt6|at|} |n^|q|at|^L{ |ih|pcakqj9|at|} |n#|d|at|^Q{ |ih|pdakqt|at|} |n#|q|at|^U    { |ih|psakJt|at|} |n^|z|n^|f|at|

|at|In each of the above holdings, the only thing that prevents the suit from being run is a single honor card. If you led the Ace of any of these suits, you would be happy to see your partner play that missing honor card. That makes the Ace the right card to lead in each of these examples.

There are some holdings that are headed by the Ace-King where the Ace could be right to lead against a notrump contract. 

Other times the opening leader will do better to lead either the King (asking for an attitude signal) or the 4th best card from these holdings. Here are some examples of such holdings:^^

pg| ***** 131 ***** |


cs|3|at|^B  { |ih|psakj72|at|} |n#|g|at|^H  { |ih|phakt95|at|} |n^|r|at|^N  { |ih|pcakj7|at|} |n#|e|at|^T  { |ih|pdakt643|at|} |n^|z|at|

Each of the above are very powerful holdings headed by the Ace-King, but there is more than one honor card missing in each case. 

The question as to whether you should lead the Ace (asking partner to drop an honor or give count), the King (asking for an attitude signal), or the 4th best card from these holdings is not an easy one to answer. 

Any of the options could work out best for the holdings on a given deal. These are judgment calls.

 factors like the bidding and the rest of the cards in order to make his decision. }

at|The best way to improve your bridge judgment is to play a lot of bridge. Good judgment is mostly a function of experience. The more bridge you play, the more you will be faced with problems like these. 

You will learn from your experience and find that your performance in judgment situations will continue to improve throughout your career as a bridge player!

nt|^b@2^z@3|n#|5|at|The only holding headed by the Ace-King in which it is clearly best to lead the King (as a request for an attitude signal) against notrump is the holding that we have been using as an example:

|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ |ih|phak4|at| }

That is, a 3-card holding headed by the Ace-King. |

at|To lead either the @HA or the @H4 from this holding is asking for trouble! |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


at|Leading the @HK from this holding will give you exactly the information that you need: whether or not your partner wants you to continue this suit. 

|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


at|When you have 4 or 5-card suits headed by the Ace-King that contain no other honors:

|cs|3|at|^F{ |ih|psak85|at|} |n^|9|at|^n{ |ih|pcak762|at|} 
|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


at|leading the King will sometimes work out, |
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


at|but on most deals you will do better to lead the 4th best card from such holdings. ^^^^On any given deal, you should use your judgment to decide between leading 4th best |
