It is time to turn our attention to a new guideline that will help you to make decisions on defense. The subject of this topic is perhaps the most famous defensive guideline of them all:

|
qx|2.3|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Always cover an honor with an honor (sometimes) }
^-
|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|Always cover an honor with an honor is also arguably the most dangerous guideline we have seen because it contains a very misleading word - ^*Ialways^*N. As you should know by now, words like ^*Ialways^*N and ^*Inever^*N do not apply in the game of bridge. 

Actually, that is not quite true. Here is an exception:

|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Always think! Never treat guidelines as if they are rules! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|The word ^*Isometimes^*N has been added to the title of this topic in order to remind you that the word ^*Ialways^*N is what bridge players might call an overbid. Always cover an honor with an honor is a useful guideline, but as you will see there are plenty of situations where it should be rejected. Here is what this guideline means:

|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ If you, as a defender, are second to play to a trick and the first card played to 
 that trick is an honor, you should cover with a higher honor if you have one. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|Note that this guideline contradicts (or at least supersedes) second hand low. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3If you have used the original Learn to Play Bridge program, you will be familiar with the concept of the pseudo-finesse which was discussed at length in that program. As an example of a pseudo-finesse, consider the lead of the @SQ by South. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


pc|sq|at|If West plays the @SJ or the @S10 to this trick, |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


pc|st|at|South will play a low spade from the dummy and his @SQ will win the trick. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


pc|ss|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The @SA will still win a trick, of course, so South will end up with 2 spade tricks - an apparent victory for the pseudo-finesse! |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


up|3|at|Not so fast! As you probably know, the ^*Ipseudo^*N in pseudo-finesse means "false". South's play does not count as a real finesse because all West has to do is cover the @SQ with his @SK (covering an honor with an honor). |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


pc|sk|at|It doesn't matter if declarer wins the @SA or not - he has no hope of winning a second trick in spades anymore. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3The play of the @SQ by South is not a real finesse because it can never gain a trick against proper defense. As we just saw, if West has the @SK he will cover the @SQ |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


md|0,s9,,sk|at|and if East has the @SK instead, he will win the trick with that card. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


pc|sssk|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


up|4|at|^^^^Meanwhile, South has a legitimate play for a second spade trick. All he has to do is lead a low spade to dummy's @SA |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


pc|sssas|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|followed by a spade toward his @SQ. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


pc|s|at|If East has the @SK then the @SQ will score a trick. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


up|5|md|0,sk,,s9|


nt|^b@2^z@3Recall the following principle that was introduced earlier in this chapter:
|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{ Don't make a play that will succeed only if an opponent makes (or has made) a mistake! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|That's exactly what the @SQ amounts to here. This pseudo-finesse will only gain a trick if West errs by failing to cover with the @SK.  Declarers should not take pseudo-finesses!
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3If this particular declarer has not learned that pseudo-finesses are exercises in futility and leads the @SQ, |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|sq|at|the fact that West has that card surrounded by the @SKJ (not to mention that the @S10 further strengthens his spade holding), |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
should make it easy for West to know that covering the @SQ with the @SK is the indicated play. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|^^^^West should be able to foresee the danger of playing the @SJ or the @S10 to this trick.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Here is one time that you should cover an honor with an honor:
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ht|i|cs|4|at|^^^-{ Cover an honor with an honor when you know that by doing so you will promote an other 
 card that you hold into a winner. If your holding surrounds the honor that was led, cover it! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|Here West knows that the @SJ (and @S10) will come into their own |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|if the @SK is played.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3West's problem is much more difficult if, instead of the @SJ10 to back up his @SK, |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


md|0,s643,,sjt|at|he has a bunch of small spades instead. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|Now East has all of the relevant middle spades |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|and it is just as important for West to cover the @SQ with 
his @SK. If he does so, |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


pc|sk|at|the declarer will be able to come to only 1 spade trick (the @SA) regardless of how he plays from here. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


up|1|at|^^If West plays a low spade instead of covering the @SQ with his @SK, |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


pc|s3|at|South will steal a second spade trick with his pseudo-finesse. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


pc|s2s|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is another good time to cover an honor with an honor:
|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{ Cover an honor with an honor when you suspect that there is a good chance that, 
 by doing so, you will be able to promote a card that your partner holds into a winner.  }
^-
|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|The tricky part is that you cannot see your partner's hand!|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Could it cost for West to play the @SK in this situation? |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


pc|sk|at|Yes, it could cost. One way to see this is by switching the South and East spade holdings. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


md|0sjt9,,,s85|at|Once West covers the @SQ with his @SK, the declarer will win dummy's @SA |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


pc|sas|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|and win 3 more spade tricks (for a total of 4) with the @SJ, @S10, and @S9 that remain in his hand. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now let's see what happens if West does not cover the @SQ with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|s3|at|The declarer will play low from the dummy and the @SQ will win the trick. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


pc|ss|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|^^^^South will lead another spade for a second finesse |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


pc|sj|at|and, as before, West does best to withhold his @SK. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


pc|s4|at|Dummy's remaining low spade is played and South's @SJ wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


pc|ss|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The dummy is now out of low spades so the declarer cannot finesse in that suit anymore. All he can do is play a spade to dummy's now singleton @SA. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


pc|sss|md|0,,,h2|at|Let's give East something to discard so we can complete this trick. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


pc|h|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at|South has won 3 spade tricks, but he will not win a 4th trick in this suit since West has retained the @SK to guard South's remaining spade. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


md|1sqjt9,sk643,sa72,s85|


nt|^b@2^z@3So when the spades that West cannot see are distributed as above |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|and South leads the @SQ (or any of his other 3 equal spades for that matter), |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|sq|at|West will give declarer an undeserved 4th spade winner if he covers an honor with an honor by playing his @SK. You now have concrete proof that the word ^*Ialways^*N does not belong in the guideline that we are studying!|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Here is the lesson to be learned from this example:
|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ht|i|cs|3|at|^^^-{ Cover an honor with an honor should usually be rejected if the declarer or dummy 
 is unable to run the suit that was led by taking repeated finesses against your honor. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


at|Here your @SK is guarded by 3 small cards, but the declarer can take only 2 finesses. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3If we take South's @S10 and give it to East, |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


md|0,,,st|at|the resulting position illustrates another reason why, when South leads the @SQ, |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


pc|sq|at|it could be costly for the defense to have West cover with the @SK.

|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


pc|sk|At|If West does so, the dummy's @SA will win the trick |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


pc|sas|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at|and South's remaining @SJ9 will allow him to take a successful finesse against East's @S10. South can win 2 more spade tricks for a total of 3 tricks in that suit |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


up|3|at|as a result of West covering the @SQ with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Now look what happens if West refuses to cover the @SQ with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


pc|s3|at|A low spade is played from the dummy and the @SQ wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


pc|s2s|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|If South continues with the @S9, |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


pc|s9|at|West plays low again |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


pc|s4|at|and if the @S7 is played from the dummy, East will win his @S10. |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


pc|s7st|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


at|There is no way that South can win 3 spade tricks now! |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


up|2|at|If the declarer plays the @SA (instead of the @S7), he will win the trick, |
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


pc|sas|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


at|but West's @SK will prevent South from winning a 3rd spade trick. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


up|4|

nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose South tries the @SJ (instead of the @S9) on the second round of spades. |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


pc|sj|at|Now West can cover with the @SK (admittedly this is not an easy play to find since West cannot see the @S10) |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


pc|sk|at|and the best South can do is to win the dummy's @SA. |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


pc|sas|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


at|All of a sudden East's @S10 is the highest remaining spade in the deck and, as before, South will be held to 2 spade tricks. |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


up|7|at|West's refusal to cover the @SQ with his @SK on the first round of the suit saves a trick for the defense.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|This example demonstrates the following instructive point:
|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^-{ Cover an honor with an honor should usually be rejected if doing so 
 will set up a finessing position against a card in your partner's hand. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


at|Again, it is hard to judge when this advice applies, since you cannot see your partner's hand!|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3As we have seen, in both this layout of the unseen spades |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


md|0st|at|and the layout now shown above, |
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


at|when South leads the @SQ |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


pc|sq|at|it is best for the defense if West refuses to cover an honor with an honor. |
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


md|0s85,,,sjt9|at|^^^^To be fair, we did see a layout where covering the @SQ with the @SK gained a trick for the defense. The big question is: how can West know if he should play his @SK in this situation when he cannot see the South and East hands?|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3You may be disappointed by the answer to this big question: West cannot know for sure. The only thing that West has to go on is the knowledge that South would be taking a pseudo-finesse if the unseen spades were distributed as above.

A pseudo-finesse is a poor play and West should not play South to be making a mistake like this. |
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


md|0sjt9,,,s85|

nt|^b@2^z@3This argues for West playing a small spade instead of covering the @SQ with his @SK. It is much more likely that the spades are distributed something like what you now see above (where the @SQ is a good play for declarer to make) |
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


md|0s85,,,sjt9|at|^^than that the spade layout is such that the declarer is attempting a pseudo-finesse (a very poor play). |
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Sometimes there will be clues available from the bidding (or from East's signals) that can help West to decide if he should play the @SK or not, but on some deals West can do no better than to fall back on the following piece of advice (which we have seen before): 
|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


ht|t|cs|4|at|^-{ Don't make a play that will succeed only if an opponent makes (or has made) a mistake! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


md|3,,hj63,hq52|


nt|^b@2^z@3Consider this situation where the declarer leads the @HJ from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


pc|hj|at|There are several possible layouts where East's best play is to cover the @HJ with the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


pc|hq|md|0hat87,hk94|at|For example, consider this distribution of the unseen hearts. |
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|The declarer can take East's @HQ with his @HA, |
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


pc|hah|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


at|but West's @HK9 sitting over South's @H10 will represent 2 heart winners for the defense. |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3If East had followed suit with a small heart (instead of covering the @HJ with his @HQ), |
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


pc|h2|at|South would play low from his hand and West's @HK would win the trick. |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


pc|h7hk|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


wt|n|at|The next time the lead is in the dummy, South can finesse against East's @HQ by playing low to his @H10. |
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


pc|hhhth|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


at|The @HA will take care of all of the defenders' remaining hearts. |
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


pc|hahhh|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


at|^^^^The defense is thus held to 1 heart trick (instead of 2) |
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


up|11|at|due to East's failure to cover the @HJ with his @HQ on the first round of the suit. |
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


md|0hk9,ht7|


nt|^b@2^z@3Here is another possible layout of the South and West hearts |
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


at|where East must cover the @HJ or else lose a trick that the defense is entitled to. |
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


pc|hq|at|^^^^South will win the trick |
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


pc|hah|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


wt|n|at|and return to the dummy with some other suit in order to attempt a finesse against the @H10 with East (South cannot see that West actually has that card). |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


pc|hhh9|at|On this layout, West can win the @H10. |
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


pc|ht|at|That will be the one and only heart trick for the defense. |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


up|7|

nt|^b@2^z@3One trick may not sound like much, but it is much better than none! None is exactly the number of heart tricks that the defense will take if East fails to cover the @HJ with the @HQ on the first trick. |
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


at|If East follows small, |
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


pc|H2|at|South will also play a small heart and the @HJ will win the trick. |
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


pc|h8h|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


at|^^^^All the remaining East-West hearts will fall under the @HA and @HK, leaving the defense with no chance to win a trick in this suit. |
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3There are several other possible layouts where it will help the defense if East covers an honor with an honor by playing his @HQ when the @HJ is led from the dummy.

There are a few possible layouts where playing the @HQ in this position will cost the defense and there are other layouts in which it does not matter if East covers or not.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3There are 2 reasons why it is a good idea for East to play his @HQ in this situation. |
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


at|First, playing the @HQ may result in a heart in West's hand being promoted into a winner (which is what happens to the @H10 on this layout). |
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


at|^^^^Second, if East is not going to win a trick with his @HQ, the best he can do is use that card to blot out a card that may be of value to the declarer (the @HJ in this case). |
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|d|cs|2|at|^-{ Usually when an unsupported honor is led from the dummy and the partner of the 
 opening leader has a higher honor, covering will be an effective play for the defense. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


ht|q|at|The @HJ is said to be unsupported in this situation because it is not backed up by the next lower touching honor (that is, the @H10). Things would be different if the @H10 was in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


md|1dj83,dkt95,dq62,da74|

nt|^b@2^z@3It is time to revisit a card combination that arose when we were considering second hand low. |
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


at|Recall that when South started by leading a small diamond from his hand, |
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


pc|d3|at|^^^^West had to play second hand low in order to prevent the declarer from winning a trick in this suit. |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


up|1|wt|n|at|Similarly, when the first lead of the suit was a small card from the dummy, |
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


pc|d2|at|East had to play second hand low or the declarer would win a diamond trick. |
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3Consider the difference if the declarer starts diamonds by leading an honor instead of a small card. |
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


at|First let's see what happens if he leads the @DQ from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


pc|dq|at|If East plays second hand low (the play that worked when a low diamond was led), |
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


pc|d4|at|West will win the @DK. |
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


pc|ddk|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


wt|n|at|^^^^When declarer eventually leads a second round of diamonds from the dummy, |
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


pc|d2|at|the @DJ will be certain to win a trick either now or later (depending on whether East plays his @DA or not). |
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


up|4|

nt|^b@2^z@3So if East plays second hand low on the lead of the @DQ, South will win a diamond trick. |
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


at|If instead East chooses to cover an honor with an honor by playing his @DA, |
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


pc|dadd|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


at|the declarer will not win a diamond trick since West still has the @DK109 over declarer's @DJ8. |
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


up|3|at|^^^^Second hand low and cover an honor with an honor cannot both be right at the same time. |
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|In this particular situation, cover an honor with an honor is the winner!|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


up|1|wt|s|

nt|^b@2^z@3If South starts diamonds by leading the @DJ out of his hand, |
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


pc|dj|at|the result is the same. If West plays second hand low (as he should when South leads a low diamond instead of the @DJ), |
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


pc|d5|at|East will win the @DA. |
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


pc|dda|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


wt|s|at|^^^^When South later leads a second round of diamonds from his hand, it won't matter which diamond West plays - the dummy's @DQ will come into its own and become a winner. |

nt|^b@2^z@3It's a different story if West applies cover an honor with an honor and plays his @DK on South's lead of @DJ. |

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's look at a few situations where a defender should know that it would be a bad idea to cover an honor with an honor. In the example shown above, South leads the @CJ. |
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


pc|cj|at|It should be easy for West to realize that covering the @CJ with the @CQ would be a poor play. |
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


at|^^^^Regardless of the club that West plays, the singleton @CA is going to have to be played from the dummy. West should simply play second hand low. There is no reason to waste the @CQ. |
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


up|1|md|0ckt9,,,c6542|

nt|^b@2^z@3Perhaps the complete layout of the club suit is something like this. |
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


at|Why did South play the @CJ? |
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


at|Well, the @CJ, @C10, and @C9 are all equals. |
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


at|Perhaps South led the @CJ in the hope that this particular West was a believer in the ^*Ialways^*N part of always cover an honor with an honor!

nt|^b@2^z@3Consider this card combination where South leads the @SQ out of his hand. |

nt|^b@2^z@3On this layout of the unseen spades, the defense will do better if West refuses to cover the @SQ. |

nt|^b@2^z@3The card combination that we have just looked at has now been turned upside down. |
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


at|Now the lead of the @SQ comes from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


pc|sq|at|^^^^East has to decide if he should cover an honor with an honor by playing the @SK (which would not be a success on this layout) |
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


at|or play second hand low (the winning play for the defense). |
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3As we have seen in our study of second hand low, the partner of the opening leader often has to make a very difficult decision when he is second to play to a trick. |
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


at|^^^^The reason is that he cannot see the holding of the third hand to play. Life is easier for the opening leader because when he is second to play to a trick, the dummy will be third to play and he can see the dummy's cards. The partner of the opening leader sometimes has to make these decisions in the dark.|
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Given the layout of the spades that he cannot see, second hand low works best for the defense here. |
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


at|Suppose we move the @S10 and the @S9 to the West hand. |
pg| ***** 195 ***** |


md|0,st9|at|In the resulting layout of the unseen spades, |
pg| ***** 196 ***** |

pg| ***** 200 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3On this layout the defense does better if East covers the @SQ with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 201 ***** |


pc|sk|at|South wins the @SA, |
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


pc|sas|
pg| ***** 203 ***** |


at|but the @SJ will be his only other trick in the suit. West's @S10 has been promoted into a third-round winner for the defense. |
pg| ***** 204 ***** |


up|3|at|^^^^The upshot is that East must cover an honor with an honor to hold the declarer to 2 tricks in spades. |
pg| ***** 205 ***** |


up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3In conclusion, when the @SQ is led from dummy, |
pg| ***** 206 ***** |


pc|sq|at|sometimes it will be right for East to cover an honor with an honor |
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


md|0st9|at|and sometimes second hand low will work out better for the defense.

pg| ***** 210 ***** |


ht|k|at|In this example, if South really has a spade holding like @SAJ1098 (where second hand low is best for East), he probably would have bid spades at some point. |

md|0,st9|n^|5|at|^^^^If South's spades were shorter he would not have bid the suit. East may well know that he should cover the @SQ with his @SK.|
pg| ***** 212 ***** |


md|3,,hqjt98,hk653|

nt|^b@2^z@3Poor old East never seems to have it easy when he is second to play to a trick, but that is not always the case. Consider this situation where the @HQ is led from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 213 ***** |


pc|hq|at|^^^^East has to decide if he should play second hand low or cover an honor with an honor by playing the @HK. Here the partner of the opening leader should be able to figure out which strategy rates to be best for the defense. Can you work it out?|
pg| ***** 214 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3East should play second hand low. |
pg| ***** 215 ***** |


at|If East decides to cover an honor with an honor by playing the @HK, it can only hurt the defense. |
pg| ***** 216 ***** |


pc|hk|md|0h742,ha|at|^^^^The @HA is obviously an important card and East does not know who has it. If West has the @HA, there is no reason for East to win a trick that his partner could win. If West's @HA happens to be singleton, East will be very sorry if he plays the @HK as both of the defenders' high hearts will be wasted on the same trick!|
pg| ***** 217 ***** |


pc|hha|
pg| ***** 218 ***** |


up|2|md|0ha,h2|

nt|^b@2^z@3If the declarer has the @HA instead of West, again East has nothing to gain by playing the @HK. South would win the @HA |
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


pc|hah|
pg| ***** 220 ***** |

pg| ***** 221 ***** |


up|3|at|Meanwhile, if East had correctly played second hand low, |
pg| ***** 222 ***** |


pc|h3|at|South would also play low and the @HQ would win the trick. |
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


pc|hh|
pg| ***** 224 ***** |


at|^^^^The declarer can take one more heart finesse, but East has enough low hearts to retain a stopper in the suit. |
pg| ***** 225 ***** |


up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Remember that the main reason to cover an honor with an honor is to promote smaller cards in either your hand or your partner's hand into winners. The sight of the dummy's powerful hearts should be enough to convince East that this will not happen if he covers the @HQ with his @HK. |
pg| ***** 226 ***** |


at|^^^^East should therefore play second hand low. At worst this play will break even, but as we just saw, there are layouts where playing second hand low will save a trick for the defense.|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


md|3,,djt4,dq92|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is a more complex situation where the partner of the opening leader is in a good position to know what to play as second hand. The @DJ is led from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 228 ***** |


pc|dj|at|^^^^East has to decide if he should cover an honor with an honor by playing the @DQ |

pg| ***** 231 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|pc|dq|md|0dak85,d763|

at|The layout of the unseen diamonds is important, |
pg| ***** 232 ***** |

dummy's @D10. |
pg| ***** 236 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3On this particular layout, playing second hand low is no better. |
pg| ***** 237 ***** |


pc|d2|at|South can play low from his hand, finessing East for the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 238 ***** |

pg| ***** 241 ***** |


at|but he can make South work harder if he plays second hand low. |
pg| ***** 242 ***** |


at|Covering the @DJ with the @DQ makes South's task a little easier. |
pg| ***** 243 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Let's trade South's @DA for one of West's low diamonds. |
pg| ***** 244 ***** |


md|0d3,da|at|In the layout that results, |
pg| ***** 245 ***** |


at|again it does not matter if East covers the @DJ with his @DQ or plays second hand low instead. We won't go through all the motions this time, but the play of the @DQ or the @D2 will result in 2 tricks for the defense against this layout of the unseen diamonds. |
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The only other way that the @DA and the @DK can be distributed is shown when we exchange those 2 cards between the West and South hands. |

md|0da,dk|at|It turns out that, in this layout of the diamond suit, |

nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|4|ht|b|at|There is a valuable lesson to be learned from this card combination:
|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


ht|j|at|^-{ When the dummy has 2 or more touching honors, it is usually best for the partner of the

ht|v|at|Here, East's best defense is to cover when the second diamond honor is led from dummy.|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


md|3,,cqj6,ck8|

nt|^b@2^z@3The guideline that we just learned in which the partner of the opening leader should wait until the last of a series of touching honors is played from the dummy before covering is a good one, but there is one notable exception to this principle. Consider this situation where the @CQ is led from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 287 ***** |

pc|c8|md|0cat32,c9754|

nt|^b@2^z@3The problem with this strategy is that, |

pg| ***** 297 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3On this layout, the defense will gain a trick if East covers the first club honor that is led from the dummy. |

nt|^b@2^z@3What makes this situation different from the last one that we saw is that East has a doubleton @CK. |

nt|^b@2^z@3It is unusual to find yourself defending against a slam contract when you have 11 high card points, but that is the situation that you find yourself in on this example deal. South, the dealer,opened the bidding with 1@S. North responded 2@C and South rebid 2@D. North rebid 2@S and South then jumped all the way to 6@S which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 313 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3It is true that quadruple jumps (like South's 6@S) are more common in figure skating than they are in bridge. In this case South's exuberance can be explained by where this deal took place. It happened shortly after midnight at a New Year's Eve party for bridge players. South, who had enjoyed a few drinks over the course of the evening, wanted to be the first bridge player to bid and make a slam in the new year! It's up to you and your partner to stop him!|

pg| ***** 397 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3This problem is very solvable. You started with 3 hearts and the dummy started with 4 hearts. South, playing 5-card majors, promised at least 5 hearts when he opened the bidding 1@H. That means that your partner was dealt a singleton heart at the most and, since West already followed suit on the first round of trump, he is now void in hearts. |
pg| ***** 398 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3South must have all of the rest of the unseen hearts. There is no chance for promotion in this suit so don't cover the @HJ with the @HQ! |

pg| ***** 402 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Did declarer's play in the heart suit seem strange to you? If he was always planning on playing the @HK on the second round of trump, why did he bother to go to the dummy to lead the @HJ? |
pg| ***** 403 ***** |


at|^^^^What South did was really very smart. He was missing 4 trumps including the @HQ and knew that 9 never suggested playing the heart suit by cashing the @HA and @HK (as opposed to finessing against the @HQ on the second round). |
pg| ***** 404 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3South figured that he had nothing to lose by leading the @HJ from the dummy on the second round of the suit. |

nt|^b@2^z@3If you thought that covering the @DQ with the @DK was a good play because you might be able to promote a card in the West hand into a winner, then you were on the right track. |
pg| ***** 442 ***** |


pc|dk|at|^^^^West did have the @D10 and that card was ripe for promotion. |

pg| ***** 444 ***** |


pc|dad|
pg| ***** 445 ***** |

pg| ***** 446 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3It is somewhat unlucky that South had the @D9 and the @D8, but there is no reason to take that chance. |
pg| ***** 447 ***** |


up|4|at|Recall that we learned that when dummy has 2 or more equal honors, the partner of the opening leader should wait until the last of these is led before covering. |
pg| ***** 448 ***** |


at|^^^^An exception to this principle occurs when the partner of the opening leader has a doubleton in the key suit, but that is not the case here since East has 3 diamonds. |
pg| ***** 449 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3So, when the @DQ is led from the dummy, |
pg| ***** 450 ***** |


pc|dq|at|East should play second hand low. |

pc|dk|at|^^^^South wins the @DA, |
pg| ***** 456 ***** |


pc|dad|
pg| ***** 457 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3It would not have helped the declarer to lead the @D2 (instead of the @DJ) on the second round of the suit. |

nt|^b@2^z@3Before we move on, let's have a look at the maneuver that South attempted in the trump suit with all 4 hands in view. 9 never suggests that with 9 cards in a suit between the declarer and dummy, |
pg| ***** 466 ***** |


at|the best play is to lay down the Ace and King in the hope that the Queen will drop. |
pg| ***** 467 ***** |

pg| ***** 468 ***** |

at|8 ever and 9 never are known as the percentage plays for their respective card combinations.|
pg| ***** 471 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
On this deal the declarer knew all about 9 never, but he found a way to give himself an extra chance to play the heart suit without loss against one of the layouts where 9 never would normally fail. |
pg| ***** 472 ***** |

pg| ***** 485 ***** |


up|4|

nt|^b@2^z@3We have learned the principle of not making a play that will only gain if an opponent makes a mistake. South's lead of the @HJ does not fall into this category because this play can never lose. |

nt|^b@2^z@3
Here are some other guidelines that describe situations where it is usually best for the defense to cover an honor with an honor:

|
pg| ***** 502 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ Usually when an unsupported honor is led from the dummy and the partner of the

 opening leader to wait until the last of these is played before he covers with a higher honor. }

|
