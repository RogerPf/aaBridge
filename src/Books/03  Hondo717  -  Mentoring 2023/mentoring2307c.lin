up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think East can do any better. I do think East should bid 3@D in IMPs, though, in Match Points I might consider passing particularly if they were vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, passing is not worth the risk, because if NS make 2@H doubled (into game), that would be a very bad result for EW.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in Match Points, if NS were vulnerable and went down one trick, that would be +200 for EW, which would be a top board because it is higher than any part score EW might make. But note that in IMPS, the +200 is only worth an IMP or two more than an EW part score.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2@H we have a chance of making (5 heart tricks, 1 club, and 2 spades). So 3@D probably is a better spot than 2@H. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is hard to know what is right. My guess is NS would win 2 or 3 IMPs and get around 65% in Match Points (e.g. a little above average).

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, it is not clear what to do, particularly since we are vulnerable and they are not. In 2nd seat you want to be a bit more disciplined in preempting. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason is that, since first seat has passed, it is much more likely partner has some strength and you could be preempting partner. That does not mean you shouldn't preempt in 2nd seat. It just means you should avoid marginal preempts.|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, I like to open 1NT with a min of 15. However, my hand is really worth much more than 14. With 5 card suit and the 4 honor club suit my hand is worth closer to 16. Usually, I stretch to open 1N if my |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenstartingpoints,Bergen Starting Points^*N|CP||FP||at|  are 16 (but not 15).|

mb|1N|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think North is strong enough to bid 3@D as a slam try. Let us try it as it would be a good illustration.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


mb|3D|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I think we have a chance at slam and I can control bid. But, I am a little worried because I only have 14 HCP and 2 diamonds. On the other hand, I do have the @DK and a nice source of tricks in clubs.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Therefore, I control bid 3@H. My 3@H bid here shows a heart control (A or K) and interest in slam and agreeing that diamonds are trump. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I didn't want to be in slam I would bid either 3N [usually 3N] or possibly 4@D or 5@D.|

PG| ***** 120 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am worried about a heart lead. But since I have clubs controlled, I will now do Roman Key Card. To do so, I play what is known as |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=kickback,Kickback Roman Key Card^*N|CP||FP||at|.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


sb|s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means the way you bid it is to bid the suit one higher than the trump suit. The reason being that it keeps the bidding lower. Here, since diamonds are trump, 4@H by me is Roman Key Card.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play 0314, so in this case a 4@S response would be 03 and the 4N response is 1 or 4.|

mb|P|mb|4N|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I know we are missing 1 key card.

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 5@C, North bids 5@D without the @DQ and otherwise bids a suit where he holds a king. And if he has the @DQ and no suit with a king, he bids 6@D. So, 5@S is to show the @DQ and the @SK.|
