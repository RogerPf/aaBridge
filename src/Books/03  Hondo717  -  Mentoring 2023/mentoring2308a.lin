nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, personally, I would only open 2N with less than 20 HCP if my Bergen points came to 21. On the other hand, Marty Bergen would agree that you could open 2N, but I don't.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I won't stretch to open 1N or 2N unless my HCP warrant it or my Bergen points are one higher (e.g. 16 Bergen for 1N, 21 Bergen for 2N). So let us undo the 3N and let West bid 2N.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know I have to keep my four spades because dummy has 4. One important defensive principle is to ^*bKeep Parity with Dummy^*b. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means when you have a long suit the same length as dummy, you must keep the same length in order to avoid setting up an extra long card for declarer.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, on first trick, declarer should use the "Rule of 11" to help determine my diamond holding. North led the 5. So you subtract 5 from 11 to determine how many cards higher than the 5 are in the 3 remaining hands which is 6. Dummy has 3 higher, declare has 1 higher. That means I have 2 higher than the 5.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not especially useful information on this hand. However, sometimes using the rule of 11 can be quite useful. It applies to all contracts when you know it is a 4th best lead. But it is most useful against NT contract.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In suits, leads are often not 4th best whereas in NT they often are. That is why it is particularly useful in NT contracts.|

Click your choice.^Yes~No~He will more often than not~You are asking too much MM^1|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some play that they won't open a Weak-2 with an outside 4 card major. I think that is a very silly rule. With a weak hand, the vast majority of the time the contract should be played in your long suit.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, you want to preempt as much as possible and the more restrictions you follow in opening Weak-Two, the less you preempt.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am at "favorable" vulnerability (our side is not vulnerable and their side is vulnerable). That is the best time to preempt and you should be particularly aggressive.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With my 6-4 hand and wonderful hearts, 3@H would not be out of the question. However, I will bid what most would do and bid 2@H.|

PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double by East is neither pure penalty nor pure takeout. The reason it cannot be penalty is because, since NS usually have a 10+ card fit, it is virtually impossible for East to have several trump tricks.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double just shows values, indicating that East thinks the hand belongs to their side and asks partner to ^*BDo Something Intelligent^*n. West will sometimes pass, particularly with a balanced hand and some defense. With nice spades West might bid 4@S. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another possibility is that West might bid a minor, particularly if they have a 5+ card minor.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although those options are possible, a better bid by East is 4NT. Although some players might think 4N is RKCB, expert partnerships play it as takeout to a minor suit. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One important bidding principle is that you optimize bidding to find your best game, which may mean that you may occasionally miss a slam.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, 4NT is essentially ^*BUnusual^*N showing both minors and asking partner to choose their better minor.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


mb|4N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|5C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To continue my explanation of 4NT by East, although West chose 5@C, I think 5@D was slightly better since West's diamonds were a bit stronger than their clubs.|

^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NIs a trump lead here called for?|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting question.|n#|3|at|  
In general when one opponent shows a 2 suited hand and their partner shows a preference, that often implies that the partner is short in the 2nd suit. So a trump lead cuts down on ruffing power.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with Qxx in diamonds, which is dummy's 2nd suit a club lead is probably not right. And since we have a very possible heart trick I think a heart is slightly better, but the trump lead was a good thought.|

PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By that you are suggesting because of the principle West should take the diamond finesse rather than playing for the 2-2 break. That is 100% correct.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What East is suggesting is that because I preempted, Declarer should know I have 6 hearts and, therefore, only have 7 unknown cards. Whereas, North only has 4 hearts and, therefore, has 9 unknown cards.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, it is more likely that North has the @DQ (9/7) than South. That is true in general when you have a 9-card fit. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this scenario, rather than playing for the drop when you have a 9-card suit missing the queen, you should finesse the partner of the person with the long suit for the queen because the odds now tilt in favor of the finesse vs. the drop.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, with no information from the bidding, the drop is only about 2% more likely than the finesse and as you can see, here the finesse works.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, EW missed bidding a slam. Although at the time West bid 5@C, I didn't think about it, after the hand was over I decided that West, with a heart void and a fit for both minors, should have bid slam. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A reasonable bid by West would have been 5NT, asking East to bid their better minor. West also could have bid 6@D or 6@C. 6@D being slightly better, although not as good as 5NT.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other question that came up, which was not relevant to this particular auction, was the use of 4NT to show 5-5 in any two suits other than spades. This bid comes up when the opponents preempt to 4@S (such as opening 4@S, opening 3@S and being raised to 4@S, or opening 1@S and being raised to 4@S). |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some players think a 4NT bid over 4@S is strictly unusual, showing precisely clubs and diamonds. But the 4NT bid shows any 2 suits, clubs/diamonds or clubs/hearts or diamonds/hearts.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Responder most often bids 5@C over 4N, expecting partner to either pass if one of their suits is clubs or bid 5@D if their suits are diamonds and hearts. Responder can only bid 5@D if they are willing to play either 5@D or 5@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, it does turn out if you look carefully at the spots you know the @H6 by West is 4th best, because once I play the @H3 and @H5 on the ace East can see the 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, unblocking is not an issue.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass by North definitely was a reasonable decision. On the other hand, in IMPs, because you want to bid game when possible, I think the reward for possibly making game outweighs the risk of going down an extra trick.|

mb|1D|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with pass by East. On the other hand,  particularly at this vulnerability I would consider a 2@C bid, and would definitely bid it with 6 clubs. I love to overcall 2@C over 1@D because it makes it much harder for the opponents to find a major suit bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 4-4 in the majors, you bid hearts first. With 5-5 in the majors, if you intend to take a 2nd bid, you bid spades first and then hearts.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly, it is not clear if I should take a 2nd bid over a possible 2@D rebid. Further, I decided that over possible 1N rebid I wanted to be able to rebid 2@H (which is weak).|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I chose to bid 1@S. That would be fine on this particular hand if you chose to bid 1@H. However, in general with 5-5 in the majors, you bid spades first and then hearts.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NShould West overcall 2@H over 1@S?|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At this vulnerability, I don't dislike the bid. The @SQ is probably wasted. So with 5-3-3-2 and not wonderful hearts, pass is okay.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


mb|2s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 2@S is probably not okay. Let's count North's |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 14 HCP, plus 1 length point, plus 2 quality suit points, plus 3 for singleton with 4 spades, less 1 for singleton @HQ for 19 Dummy Points. That is enough for North to bid 3@S. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*NTo bid 2@S, I did look closely at my hand..... and with 7 losers and a wasted @HQ, I downgraded the hand. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting that you mentioned ^*B7 Losers^*n. Many players use something called |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ltckit,Losing Trick Count (LTC)^*N|CP||FP||at| to evaluate their hand.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Without getting into a lot of details, a 7 loser hand is considered a weak opener which would justify bidding only 2@S. However, I think |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ltckit,Losing Trick Count (LTC)^*N|CP||FP||at|, although easy to learn, can often be very inaccurate which is why I think you should learn Bergen Hand Evaluation.|

pc|S3|sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead of @S3 from @SQ3 surprised me. I will discuss it more after the play. Nevertheless, I have 4 spade tricks, assuming one spade loser, 1 heart trick, 1 club trick, 1 diamond trick, and a ruff in dummy for 8 tricks.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I need two more tricks. If spades are 2-2 that is a 2nd ruff. And perhaps I can set up a long diamond or two. So I am going to win the spade and play diamonds. I might ditch a club loser.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what should be the West's opening lead, normally, had North not bid diamonds, I would lead the @DK. However, it is often wrong to lead a suit the opponents have bid. Further, I do not recommend leading unprotected aces. Therefore, as West, I probably lead a club.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I prefer leading count from 3 small. If you prefer attitude (top of nothing) that is fine. MUD (Middle Up Down) is definitely my least favorite.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most better players prefer count not attitude because they can often work out where the honors are when they know count. And, in fact, against suits, many better players lead 3rd best from 4 and low from 5 because that makes the count clearer on opening lead.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically what I am saying is that many better players think the most useful thing on defense is to count out the distribution.|

PG| ***** 144 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had East been in the pass out seat as West, he should make a takeout double over 2@S as a balancing bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Letting the opponents play at the 2 level with a known 8+ card fit is losing bridge in the long run.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen's theory is, even in direct seat over 2@s, if short in spades, East should make the same bid as they would in the balancing seat and double. The double does not show extra values. It just is essentially the same as a balancing double.|
