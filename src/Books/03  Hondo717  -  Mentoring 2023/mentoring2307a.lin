Some people play something called a ^*BSandwich NT^*N meaning 1NT by me shows a weak hand with the 2 remaining suits, often 5 cards in the minor.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the correct bid assuming they are playing |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=supportdoubles,SUPPORT DOUBLES AND REDOUBLES^*N|CP||FP||at|. 2@S by West promises 4 spades because with 3 spades West would Redouble.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, East knows they have a 9 card fit and it is correct by the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| to bid 3@S.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, another convention that is often played, and works well here, is something called a ^*BMaximal Double^*n. With the current hand East wants to bid 3@S even with a weakish hand. However, suppose he had an invitational hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they play ^*BMaximal Double^*n, a double here would say East wants to invite 4@S and 3@S directly says he is just competing to 3@S.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most common way to play a ^*BMaximal Double^*n is to only play a double as ^*BMaximal Double^*n if the opponents bid the suit one below your suit. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand, since hearts are one below spades and East has no other way to show an invitational hand, a double would be ^*BMaximal Double^*n. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if the opponents were competing in clubs or diamonds, East has room to bid a new suit as a game try, so double would not be ^*BMaximal Double^*n and at least suggest a penalty double. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, a few play that any double in this type of auction is ^*BMaximal Double^*n, even if the opponents' suit is not one below your suit, since it is unlikely East would ever hold a hand where he would want to make a penalty double.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An interesting way to play the hand and probably reasonable. Off the top declarer can count 1 spade, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds and 1 club and needs two more tricks.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So one way is to try for 3-3 hearts. And if that doesn't work, then try for 3-3 diamonds with North not having the @DQ. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is probably how I play the hand and that works as well because even though diamonds are 4-2, they are split in such a way that N/S can only take 1 diamond trick. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But West tried for diamonds first which is fine so long as North does not have the @DQ. So all roads lead to 3N making.|

mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@C is technically the best opening bid and is a very reasonable choice. On the other hand, with only 3 cards in the majors, it is likely the opponents have a major suit fit. Therefore, a tactical 3@C opener would be reasonable as well.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, then we might miss game on some hands when partner has a good hand. On this hand, 1@C might work out well.|

Or I could bid 3@S, asking pard to bid 3N with a spade stopper. The problem being, if he bids 4@C, not sure whether or not I should bid 5@C. But I think 3@S is probably better than 3N, and then, with 3 aces, will try 5@C over 4@C.|
