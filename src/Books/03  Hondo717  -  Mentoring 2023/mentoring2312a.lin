PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing that system a double is a single suited hand (not clubs since partner bid clubs) and suits are that suit and a higher suit at least 5-4. That is very non-standard and in any case I have a clear pass.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could consider your hand a 1N opener. It has two upgrades -- a 5-card suit and a quality suit. My general rule is that I will open 1N with 14 if my Bergen upgrades take me to 16. So I would have considered 1N with your hand, although 1@C bid was fine.|

Another possibility is to treat the East hand as invitational. In that case, some play that if West bids a 2@H transfer and then bids 3@H over the forced 2@S response, that shows an invitational hand with 5-5 in the majors. |

I prefer to play jumps to the 3 level over 1N are natural slam tries.|
