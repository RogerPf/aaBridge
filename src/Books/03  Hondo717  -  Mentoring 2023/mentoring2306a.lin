mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with North's pass. Hands with flat 11 counts are not as good as they look.|

mb|2N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sb|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am theoretically a point heavy for a 1N overcall which typically shows 15-18. My only other choice is to double and then bid 3N over whatever North responds and that could be risky.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain one way to decide on the odds. Let's give East 7 points. I have 19. That is a total of 26. So partner averages about 6, which I guess is enough to make 3N.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I could have doubled and corrected to 3NT but thought 2N was slightly more descriptive. Generally when you overcall 1N you should play a 4 point range. Many now play a 1N overcall is 14-17 especially if not vulnerable, but standard is 15-18.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is even more important after an opponent opens a weak 2-bid to play a wider range because you have less room to maneuver.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way to play the club suit given the auction is to cash the A and K. That will pick up the suit any time there is a 3-2 break, a singleton jack, or West holds Jxxx which is much more likely than East holding Jxxx given the weak 2 opener.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Let us talk about how North might play the spade suit, given the auction. Normally, when you have a choice of leading an honor from dummy or leading towards and honor, you lead towards the honor.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, in this case, if you lead the Q and West covers with the K, it takes two of declarer's honors to take care of one of the defenders honors. On the surface North's play was reasonable.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the only way declarer is making is to lose no spades. Admittedly East might have the singleton K though that is highly unlikely, in which case playing the A is right.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the best thing to do is to hope West has the @SK. Then you could hope that West has Kx and that leading low towards the J followed by the A would work. And if there were no bidding that is a reasonable alternative. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, given the auction there is a good chance East is short (although a void is not that likely). So the best way is to lead the @SQ. If it is covered you win the A.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's say East also follows with a spade. Then the question is, should you play the @SJ hoping for a 2-2 break, or get to dummy and finesse West for the @S9. However, on this hand East shows out of spades. So North has to finesse West again.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North gets to dummy and leads a low spade. Best defense is for West to play the @S8 leaving him with K10. North wins the @S9 and exits with a diamond.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then East is stuck after wins the @DA. If she leads a diamond, North wins the @DK in dummy and takes another spade finesse. And if East leads a heart, Declarer ruffs, and will either get to dummy or be able to draw trump if West overruffs.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, this is a very tricky hand to play. But a world class expert would work it out logically. BTW, also notice that EW can make 5@H. So 5@H was the winning bid. Or even 5@D which also makes.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, if you have a "freak hand" (meaning at least 11 cards in two 5+ card suits) you want to declare. On competitive hands, good distribution is better than more HCP.|

mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the 4@S opener. Technically West could open 1@S but tactically 4@S is likely to work out better. |

mb|5C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just like last hand with wonderful distribution, not to mention a nice hand North has a very clear 5@C bid. It might not work out which is why preempts are so powerful.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, passing also won't work out a lot of the time. After preempts you have to guess what to do often. If you have a highly distributional hand, are short in their suit, and have some points it is almost always right to play the hand rather than defend, just as was illustrated last hand.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An unlucky hand for N/S and this is why you preempt. As it turns out North's pass was best because they lose 2 spades, 1 club, and 2 diamonds. On the other hand, 5@C was still the best bid because more often than not it will work out much better than defending 4@S.|

PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once you open 4@S you are short in clubs, meaning it is much more likely I have some clubs. So bidding 5@C is likely to find an 8 or 9 card fit. Not on this hand, but in general it is true. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, once there is a preempt, your best tactic is to make the bid most likely to give you a good result and passing with a 6-card suit and shortness in the preemptor's suit, is not as likely to work as well as bidding.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing you should think about, especially when bidding slam, is how many |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| you have, particularly relative to your HCP.

up|52|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*nWhat is best way to play the hand?|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count your tricks. You have 2 hearts, 2 clubs, 5 spades (assuming 3-2 break), 1 diamond, and a sure spade loser. So you need 3 diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only way to get 3 diamonds is for West to have the singleton or doubleton @DK. Therefore, win the heart and draw 3 rounds of trump and then play 3 rounds of clubs, ruffing the last one, in case the QJ10 are tripleton (very unlikely). |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then lead a low diamond towards the @DAJ. I don't see any other way to make. Having said that, if I had let East lead the @D10, you would have made also.|

Since partner passed, game is unlikely. Therefore, it makes it harder for 4th seat, who must have some values.|

mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid by East. Whenever partner opens a weak 2 and you have 3 card support you should raise to 3,
