mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C is okay. My first choice is to double, although that is a little light. Whenever you are short in the opponent's suit, you should strain to bid. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The advantage of double is it gets all 3 suits into play. The disadvantage is that North is a little light, but these days that is considered okay.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East made a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=negativedoubles,Negative Double^*N|CP||FP||at|. East happens to have both unbid suits.|

PG| ***** 52 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are right the hand does not have 3 spades. However, the double only promises hearts. It definitely does not promise diamonds, despite what you may have heard.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, the double says that East would have responded 1@H had North passed except of course he couldn't over 1@S. The double does not necessarily deny 5 hearts, although it only promises 4.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East bid 2@H, which definitely promises 5, that would also show at least 10 points or so. Therefore, with a weaker hand and 5 hearts, he would still double.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now we are not vulnerable and they are. That means I want to be more aggressive. If I had 4 clubs, I would definitely bid 3@C since I know we have a 9-card fit, meaning 3@C obeys the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| (bid to the level which equals your number of trump).|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But we might only have an 8-card fit and I am long in the spades that West opened. That means both North and East are short in spades. Therefore, East can over-ruff spades if North ruffs. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West and North were short in spades I would be much more comfortable because then partner could overruff the short opponent. So my 5 spades is a big minus. On the other hand, I like my HCP, the @HA, the @DK, and the diamond doubleton.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


mb|3c|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I would definitely bid 3@C in Match Points and so did here because of the favorable vulnerability. Let's see how it works out.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NIf you were East, would you have considered 3 spades?|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No way. Probably, it would be a 7 card fit. Remember, in competitive biding almost always
use the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I have to reluctantly bid 1@S. One potential problem is that partner will sometimes raise on 3-card support, which would really be awful for me.|

So you lead the Q from Qj10 or QJ9. Therefore, the proper lead is the @DQ. It is just unlucky that it gives away a trick though it is still the right lead.|

mb|1D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@D is very reasonable with the East hand. With 10 HCP and 10 cards in the 2 longest suits and it meet the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, tactically I might consider 3@D despite the 2 aces and not wonderful diamonds because I am afraid they might have a spade fit.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly, the hand is too strong for 3@D officially and 1@D is the classic bid.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


mb|1N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West passing is okay, given the vulnerability. However, if playing |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| here, particularly if not vulnerable, a 2@C call, showing clubs and a major (can't have diamonds because he would have raised) would not be out of the question.|

mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure I bid |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=stayman,Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at|, but it is going to work out. I probably would get aggressive and with the North hand bid 2@H transfer and then 3@H to show 5-5.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perhaps. You can not do "double dummy" analysis meaning you can't decide the best way to bid and play based on looking at all 52 cards. You have to go with the percentages.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 5-5, particularly with a 9-card fit 4@H will usually be the better contract.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, if I could see all 4 hands, I could also make 4@H because I could finesse against East's heart queen. Those double dummy analyzers which you often see when you play duplicate would say I should make 4@H. |
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, that is very misleading, particularly in this hand, because based on the auction, it is much more likely that West, not East has the long hearts.|
