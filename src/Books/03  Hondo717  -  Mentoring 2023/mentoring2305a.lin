sb|s|mb|P|mb|1H|mb|P|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a reasonable bid by East. You normally should have 4 card support. However, if you have shortness and nice 3-card support, you can and should bid 2@H as it is more encouraging. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, I probably bid 1N with the East hand because the hearts are okay though not great. On the other hand, it is a reasonably balanced hand, and have honors in all suits. But 2@H is fine.|

PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if they have a fit we probably have a fit, so I make a takeout double. Typically when you are in a possible competitive situation, the person who is short in their suit should take action because if I pass and West passes, partner probably has some length in hearts and will be unable to balance and that would be disadvantageous to our side. Therefore, the basic rule is, in competitive auctions, the person short in their suit should take action.|

However, if your distribution is exactly 4-5-2-2 and partner responds 1N forcing over 1@H you are forced to bid 2@C, which normally promises 3. I don't think that has happened in at least a few years at these lessons.|

mb|1H|mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2C?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C is a reasonable bid, but had East passed I would have had a problem as to the best rebid. With a nice 3-card support and a singleton I would usually bid 2@S On the other hand, I have awfully nice hearts as well, so 2@H is probably a slightly better bid.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But now that East overcalled I can make a "support double" which shows 3-card spade support. In fact, if I don't raise or double, partner would assume I had no more than 2 spades. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, the double is unlimited in terms of points. All it does is show 3 spades. Although more often than not I have a weakish opener, or I could have as much as 18 or so.|

PG| ***** 43 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| North could consider turning the double into a penalty double. I think I would pass actually.

Plus declarer addons of 2 points for the singleton and 1 point for the side 4+ card club suit comes to 14.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, because East's 2@C overcall negates much of the value of North's club suit, I would deduct 2 or 3 points and consider the hand worth around 11 or 12. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think 3@S (invitational) is a reasonable bid for North, and 2@S is much too conservative. |
