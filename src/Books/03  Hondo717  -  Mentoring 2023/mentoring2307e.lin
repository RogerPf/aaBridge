up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss what doubles by either East or West mean. Over 4 level preempts they are not penalty per se. If someone has a long suit and preempts at the 4 level the odds that you have enough trump to make a penalty double are slim to none. So doubles are ^*BCard Showing^*n.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They basically say "partner I have some values. Do something intelligent".|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes partner will pass hoping to set the preempt. However, with a distributional hand they might bid. On this hand, East has a clear pass. East would need at least 10 or 11 points to be able to double.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As West suggested, double was possible with her hand although far from clear. Again, particularly since West is known to have 5 spades, it is not a pure penalty double. It is a card showing double.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At this vulnerability, although a double would not be completely out of line given the doubleton diamond and only 15 HCP, I think pass is probably best. I would like to have 17 or so, or diamond shortness and 15 or so, in order to double.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out if West doubles, East should call 4@S (not 4@H because West is not promising hearts) and 4@S is down 2 if North leads a heart. Since I have the @SA I will give North a heart ruff and 4@S is down 2 losing 2 diamonds 1 club 1 spade and a heart ruff.|

mb|P|mb|1D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@D is reasonable. However, although I don't like to open 1N with 2 doubletons, I will make an exception when I am 6-3-2-2 with a 6 card minor, sometimes particularly, if I am not willing to bid 3@D over partner's response I open 1N. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, I think the North hand is slightly too weak to bid 3@D over 1@H or 1@S, though, it is close. So I like 1N slightly better.|

PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in general opening 1NT will lead to the best contracts more often than not. And note that if I held 5 hearts instead of 5 spades, 2@H is probably a better spot than 2@D.|

Because since there are 2 passes, it is likely that, particularly if you have a weak opener that your opponent has a decent hand. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, there is something called ^*BThe Rule of 24^*N that you can use in 3rd seat. If the first 2 players pass, it turns out on average they hold around 16 HCP between them. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means the 3rd seat and 4th seat have around 24 HCP between them, hence ^*bRule of 24^*N. In this case since I have 11 then the opponent holds around 13. And I, therefore, want to make it as hard as possible for West to bid. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If my 6 card suit was anything but clubs, despite the fact that I have an opener I would open a weak-2. But with two 3-card majors and only 6 so-so clubs it is quite possible we can compete in a major and I might be preempting partner. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I will open 1@C because I don't really want to open 3@C, although, on this hand it would work out well.|

mb|1H|mb|2c|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C is definitely not the best bid. Personally I would bid 2@H to show a limit raise in clubs, though, 3@C preemptive is possible.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using the Rule of 24, since North has 13 HCP, that means East will average around 11 HCP. North is short in spades so, although over 1@H East could easily overcall 1@S even with a relatively weak hand, it would be harder for East to overcall 2@S over 2@H.|
