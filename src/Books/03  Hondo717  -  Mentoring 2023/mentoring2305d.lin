mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2N3d|an|unusual v unusual|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West needs to explain 3@D. "Unusual v Unusual" doesn't cut it as an explanation, particularly since there are many ways to play it. When explaining bids in general, you don't name the convention. You actually explain what the bid means.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well why not Splinter in clubs then anyway. West intends to be in at least 4@S. Since 3@D is forcing that is certainly a reasonable bid to show her strength. However, 4@C is a better bid IMO, to show 4+ spades, GF, and club shortness.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So let us go back and redo your bid.|

mb|p4h|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid by East. That shows slam interest 1st or 2nd round control in hearts, and no control in diamonds.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points I lead the @CA. In IMPs I am trying to beat it, and since I know West has at most one club I am leading a diamond hoping we can take one diamond and the @CA.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they make an overtrick, no big deal in IMPs or in Match Points, since I suspect most pairs won't bid slam and we would get a bad result anyway if they make.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The moral of this hand is don't be seduced into using a special convention when you have a better alternative. West has a 4@C bid over 1@S to start with. There was no reason to avoid bidding that even after 2N. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And East made a nice 4@H bid to get to slam, realizing the 4 small clubs were an asset. Very few pairs would get to slam and it is a pretty good slam.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@5^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the "Unusual over Unusual" convention, it is a complicated convention, but worth learning if you are an advanced bidder.

PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|p?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a rule in IMPs that I rarely pass a 2NT invitation because the upside of making 3N is so high, and if I go down one extra in 2N it is no big deal. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only time it is right to pass is if we can make exactly 2N and not 3N which is pretty rare.|

pc|HT|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East is playing what is called "coded 10" that means the lead of the 10 usually shows the J and the K or the A (2 higher). So leading 10 tends to show AJ10 or KJ10. And the lead of the jack, therefore, denies anything higher. Of course from QJ10 you lead the Q.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A very hard hand to play, however, there were some clues from the bidding. Because East doubled, and showed hearts with his opening lead, either 4 or 5, he must be short in diamonds. Therefore, diamonds are not setting up.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North can count 7 likely tricks or 6 actually once the club is led after East wins the @SA-- 2 spades, 2 clubs, 1 heart, and 1 diamond. And once East cashes the @HA, a 2nd heart trick. That is 7 tricks.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East is known to have 4 spades. So it would not be a horrible idea when in with the club to lead the @S9 and let it ride if East does not cover. And that would be the 8th trick.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In theory East should cover but only because partner has the S8. Anyway, you need to plan the hand based on the bidding and try to count enough tricks to make your contract.|

You only open 1@D with 3 diamonds when you are exactly 4-4-3-2. In fact, some people play a "short club" where 1@D promises 4 diamonds and with 4-4-3-2 they open 1@C.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't particularly love that. However, if you choose to play it, that is fine. But responder MUST not bid with less than 6 points or so even if they are short in clubs because even if you play that it turns out when opener opens 1@C, they have 4+ clubs around 85 % of the time.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So don't panic if short in clubs with a weak hand. I prefer to play "better minor" meaning I open 1@C with 4-4 if my clubs are a lot better than my diamonds. I might choose to open 1@C here playing that, but my clubs are not that much better plus I will play the standard treatment and open 1@D.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer to play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=checkback,Checkback Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| which is similar but not identical.|

And if they have neither major they bid 2@D rather than 2N which makes the bidding a lot more flexible.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on this hand, I would bid 2@D playing |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=checkback,Checkback Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at|, and opener has the option of bidding 2@S to play.|

mb|2N|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sb|s|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North is showing around 11 points or so. It is close as to whether or not I should bid 3N. In IMPs I have a 3NT bid with 13 points and 3 aces. Aces are actually worth closer to 4.5 points than 4 points. So you should upgrade a point or so when you hold 3 aces.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |

mb|P|mb|1S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, particularly if vulnerable, you should be careful about overcalling at the 2-level and only do so if you have a 6-card suit or a nice 5-card suit. Here I will overcall 2@H, because my hearts are very nice.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But my flat distribution is a huge downgrade as is my lack of aces. Many advanced players would pass and I would not say that is wrong, although I tend to like to get in the auction when I can.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


mb|2H4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is not terrible. But 3@H is better to show strength--a limit raise. That way partner will have a better idea what to do if we compete.|

mb|3H|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a good rule of thumb if partner shows a limit raise and you have a singleton you always should bid game. It will be right more often than not. So, here, although 3@S is fine, 4@S is possible. |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main downside of the hand is the 3 small hearts, which is the worst holding you can have in an opponents suit which makes 3@S even more reasonable.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West should still bid 4@S. West needs to be consistent. If you were bidding 4@S originally, no reason to change your mind now.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not a wonderful contract, but it has plays. Although it is not going to matter here let me discuss how to play the spade suit. I know many people use the rule ^*B8 Ever 9 Never^*N meaning they play for the drop of the queen with a 9 card fit rather than finessing. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, that rule is actually incorrect in many situations. If someone has shown a long suit, which I did by over-calling 2@H then it is much more likely that I am short in spades. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, therefore, the correct way to play the hand is to play a high spade first, in case the @SQ drops. Then rather than playing for the drop it is actually better odds to take the finesse given the auction. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So declarer should now play a diamond to the Jack: and take the spade finesse. As I said here, it didn't matter, but it is the better play.|

PG| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted most often responder will bid 3N. There is no harm in having the more flexible option. 3@D indicates no 4 card majors. |
