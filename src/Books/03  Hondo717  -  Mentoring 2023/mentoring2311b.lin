cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My hand was almost too strong for 1N but felt it was best action despite slightly off shape distribution. You normally don't open 1N with six-card minors. However, I felt it was the least flawed bid. It did not work here .|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because EW got a plus score and it is easy for them to have a minus score,I suspect they would win a couple of IMPs or have about a 60% to 65% Match Point score.|

mb|1S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would like to overcall 2@H. But normally to make a two-level overcall you need a 6-card suit or a nice 5 card suit, especially vulnerable. Here my heart suit it too short and weak to justify a 2-level overcall. Further, having 3 spades is a minus because if they don't have a spade fit, it will mean partner has 3 spades at least.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you have a 3 card holding in one opponent's suit and they don't have a fit in that suit, that is a minus. So I will reluctantly pass.|

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After the hand, North said he passed 3@H because he downgraded his hand since it was loaded with Quacks (Queens and Jacks). However, that argument is flawed for two reasons. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First there are three tens while there are 5 so-called quack. Second when Queens and the Jacks are paired with Kings and Tens,they are worth their full value.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H is a so-so contract and we have to lose 1 spade, 1 diamond, and 1 club for sure. So not being in 4 is okay, particularly in Match Points. But I still think North should be 4@H.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I still think North should bid 4@H. His argument about quacks is not really correct on this hand. In general, queens and jacks not paired with other honors are not worth as much as their HCP indicate.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A better bid for North is 4NT which shows the both minors. If I have a trick in the majors 5 of a minor has plays. And if I don't they probably can make a major suit game.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a pretty clear 4@S bid using |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| with 10 card fit. To explore what happens next, I let both bids stand.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction, I could have bid 4@D not vulnerable against vulnerable East/West. But I am not sure I want them to be in 4@S.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you bid 4 of a minor in a competitive auction and the opponents have a major you have to be willing to have them play in 4 of a major and be sure, or reasonably sure, of setting them. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, although partner bidding 3@D will often have a 6 card diamond suit. But they might not and I only have 4-card.

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North's 5@C is a nice bid. However, it is inconsistent with his original bid of 3@D, which is not forcing. If he intended to bid this way he should have bid 4NT over 2@S (as previously mentioned) to show a hand where he wants to play at the 5-level in one of his minor suits.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if NS were vulnerable and EW not vulnerable, North should bid 4N over 2@S. That hand is incredibly powerful. Plus it is much more likely I have some points for the following reason.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's give West an average of 8 HCP which is probably actually a little high for a weak-2. North has 18. That means there are about 14 HCP between East and South. So on average I will have 7 or so.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So they are essentially equivalent. On this hand, I have no good information so I will play for the drop since I have the @CA as an entry. But had one of my opponents shown a 5+ card suit I would finesse the other opponent for the @DQ if I could. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being, if one opponent shows a 5 card suit, he has 8 unknown cards. Whereas, the other opponent has more than 8 unknown cards. Therefore, it is slightly more likely one of the unknown cards is the @DQ.|
