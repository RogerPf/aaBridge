There are very few hands where 5 of a minor is a better contract than 3N. You only have to take 9 tricks in 3N, which is much easier than taking 11 tricks.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason to play ^*BReverse Bergen^*n is that it gives you extra room when you have a limit raise. You can make a game try when you have a limit raise. And it is more likely you want to make a game try with a limit raise than with a 7-9 raise. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is more likely you have around 14 points which is what you need to invite for a limit raise. However, it is really a minor issue. So if you want to play ^*BRegular Bergen^*n that is fine. In fact Marty Bergen prefers ^*BRegular Bergen^*n because he feels you almost always know when to bid game over a limit raise.|
