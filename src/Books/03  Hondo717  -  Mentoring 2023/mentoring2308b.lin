mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat you should strain to preempt if you do not have an opener. In general, after 2 passes, 1st and 2nd seat average around 16 HCP meaning 3rd and 4th average around 24. So since I have 8, West is likely to be relatively strong around 16 or so which is just right as you can see.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With that in mind, it is good to preempt even with five card suit if you have a singleton or void especially because it makes it harder for the stronger fourth seat to find the best bid. So I bid 2@S.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That worked out reasonably well for NS. If I don't preempt, West opens 1N and they likely end up in 2@H making. That illustrate the point about the value of preempts in 3rd seat in particular.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, sometimes it is a good idea to preempt even with a minimum opener in 3rd seat. The main point is, you should strain to preempt in 3rd seat with a long suit and distributional hand.|

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


sk||mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should bid 4@H. There is no need to check on strength of Weak-2 by bidding 2N by West. No matter how weak partner is, West clearly has more than enough to bid 4@H. And although slam is possible, it is very unlikely because they could easily have 2 club losers for one thing.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|4H?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what North should do over 4@H, if not at unfavorable vulnerability (we are vul, they are not) or perhaps Match Points 4@S would be very reasonable.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even here I would be worried about not bidding 4@S. With 3 hearts, it is likely partner is short in hearts-- a singleton at best. So a spade fit is quite likely. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But given the vulnerability, pass is probably best but could definitely be wrong on some hands. Here, pass is definitely best as it turns out.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, it not clear what 4@H bidder has. Partner of preempter knows more about the hand than the opponents. That is the value of preempting.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I have a feeling that partner's double may have been light because he is short in spades. He could probably double again after I pass. And if he doesn't that probably is okay as well.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should not make a game try opposite 6-9 or bid 4@S which is a huge overbid. I think 3@S is his best bid. 3@S is NOT a game try. It is just competing to 3@S.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, West was way too optimistic about how good his hand was opposite a 2@S raise.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In a partial either hearts or diamonds we take 3 heart tricks, 3 diamond tricks, and 3 club tricks making 3 most likely. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So -100 EW probably is decent score both in Match Points and IMPs. BTW I think double is reasonable by North. However, he then can never show he has 5 hearts.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another point is I think I mis-defended. I should have played another spade after cashing the @SK, trick eight and nine. Then I think we beat it another trick. |
