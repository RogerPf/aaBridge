nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, there are some tactical considerations. If I bid 4@C, do I want them to bid 4@S? I think the answer is yes because partner did open and I have a pretty nice hand, and a stiff heart which means I could easily get a heart ruff.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in general you want to avoid bidding "4 over 3" unless it is clear. If partner has the @HA, I could see us easily beating the hand. We beat the hand even if partner also has the @CA because we take one heart, one club, 2 heart ruffs, and one diamond.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, if partner has the @HA and the @CA. we have 2 spade losers and no club losers or heart losers. So if I can hold my diamond losers to one we make 4@C. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points I bid 4@C and plan to double 4@S because plus 200 is likely a good score and we might be making 4@C and only beating 3@S one or none. In IMPs it is a more difficult decision. I think I pass and hope we beat the hand.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was very lucky to make. ^*BMy partner needs to buy me a drink and FedEx one to the Movie Maker.^*N A plus score on this hand is probably a good result.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid 2N with North hand. It does have some upside and might make.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H could have been the best contract so pass had some merit. A good principle to follow is when you have several imperfect options choose the one with the most upside.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Passing 2@H probably has less upside than bidding 2N since I might have a pretty good hand (up to 17 or so) and 3N might be our best spot.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNo worries North buying a drink for Howard. Very soon BBO will enable BOTs with Artificial Intelligence giving you the perfect bid. Then Howard would buy you a drink and FedEx it. You must keep an eye on FedEx for drink if it does not arrive. It is because the driver consumed it probably.|
