mb|P|mb|P|mb|1S|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good bid by North. Yes, assuming East passes, if I bid 2@C, it is possible we are in a 4-2 fit. Then with a 6-4 hand he must take a bid. So it is worth the risk that I bid 2@C over his double, because he could bid 2@D, but with a pretty bad suit (although it is 6 cards which helps) and 4 hearts that has less upside.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would double again, and now there would be no risk if I bid 3@C, he can correct to 3@D. And since he doubled again, I would know he didn't have clubs but had long diamonds. BTW, some people play a convention known as ^*BEqual Level Conversion^*n.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means even the first takeout double by North is no risk because if I bid 2@C and doubler bid 2@D, that does not show a strong hand. It merely shows a hand with diamonds and hearts.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@D we lose 3 diamonds and 1 heart for sure, and might lose a second heart. So in IMPs probably equivalent to their making 2@S. However, in Match Points it s a slightly better score.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, you should not let them play at the 2-level in a known 8 card fit. Further, in general you should strain to not let them play the hand when you are 6-4. You would much rather be on offense than defense.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why North should have bid again over 2@S and they might also bid 3@S for down 1. So bidding over 2@S has lots of upside and little downside.|

mb|P|mb|2N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N is a very reasonable bid. The hand is worth more than 19 HCP. The 5 card suit is worth 1 point, the 3 honor "quality suit" is worth another points, and it has 4.5 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| which is an above average number for a hand with 19 HCP.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of my hand evaluation methods is what I call |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| points. It is based on the following theory. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can have up to 2 quick tricks in each suit meaning you can have up to 8 quick tricks in one hand (although I don't think I have ever had a hand with more than 6 quick tricks, and even that probably only happened once). |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 40 total HCP. 40 divided by 8 means that each quick trick in your hand is worth about 5 points. So to count "Quick Trick Points" you count your quick tricks and multiply by 5. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case, North has 22.5 quick trick points. If your |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks Points^*N|CP||FP||at| exceed your actual HCP, as they do on this hand then your hand is better than it looks and you should upgrade it. The idea being aces and kings are underrated and queens and jacks are overrated. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, hands with lots of |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| have lots of aces and kings, or sometimes queens paired with aces or kings, which is just as good. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, North's hand is worth closer to 21 or even 22 rather than 19.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*nI can't wait to count up Peter's Zar points.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East is talking about this very complicated but pretty accurate way of evaluating hands called Zar points. It is too complicated for me, but you might want to check it out.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once partner opens 2N it is likely I want to play in slam with my hand in clubs. That it is difficult, unless you have specific agreements, to get to a minor suit slam over a 2N opener. Anyway I am going to bid 4@C as |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=gerberetc,Gerber^*N|CP||FP||at|. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And bid 6 assuming we are not missing more than one ace. Further, if I could somehow play RKCB for clubs I might be able to bid 7 but no way to do that without some complicated agreements. |

mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is a slight underbid. West should discount the the @CJ, but even so he has 10 HCP and very nice spade support. Admittedly, 4-3-3-3 distribution is a downgrade (although you could consider the @H10 a slight upgrade). |

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think pass is fine by East. However, East could use Bergen ^*BAdjusted Points^*N for applying the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at| where you use all of the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenstartingpoints,Bergen Starting Points^*N|CP||FP||at| rules except for length to count your points.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By doing so East has 11 HCP plus 1 point for the 3 honor quality club suit. And, therefore, counts to 12 Bergen adjusted points. Now the hand is satisfies |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at| as 12 + 8 cards in the minors = 20.|
