up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a better line for declarer where they might only lose three tricks rather than four. After drawing trump, declarer should try and set up the spade suit for a discard of their losing diamond. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So declarer should play the @SK and then the @SQ. Many players in the South position would take their @SA on the first or second round of spades. In that case, declarer can win the diamond return, play the @S10 and overtake with the @SJ. Spades are now set up so declarer can discard their losing diamond on the 4th spade trick.  |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against an expert pair, that line would not work. On the @SK, North would give count in spades by playing the @S9 (high-low with a doubleton). Since South sees eight spades between his hand and West, and North is showing a doubleton spade, South knows East started with exactly three spades and knows to hold up for two rounds.|

PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason you preempt is that you often have to make the opponents guess as to what to bid just as they did on this hand. I happen to guess right, though sometimes I will guess wrong.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 13 HCP, one length point, one point for 4-card side suit, and two points for the singleton for 17 total |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Bergen Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at| and could invite with 3@H in case I had 9.|

mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I guess North decided good enough to bid game. I probably bid game anyway over an invitational 3@H. With the same HCP distributed slightly differently I think it is a clear 4@S bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you change @HA to @DA and change the @D5 to @H5, the hand would be is a much better than the one North actually holds. Sometimes the placement of the high cards changes the value of your hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure there is a better line, but declarer's line guaranteed down one, given correct defense. Declarer should lose 2 diamonds and 2 clubs. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, because West misdefended by not cashing a 2nd club, declarer ended up making the hand by discarding a losing club on the @DK.|
