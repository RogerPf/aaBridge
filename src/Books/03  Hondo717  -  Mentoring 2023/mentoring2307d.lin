nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, in this auction 3@C by North would have been a cue bid indicating a limit raise in diamonds. Otherwise, cue bids are most often ^*BStopper Asking^*N. In other suits it is ^*BStopper Telling^*N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is how vulnerability affects your bidding.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you are vulnerable, in IMPs only, you stretch and bid close games because the vulnerable game bonus is worth a lot of points when you make. When you are not vulnerable and in a competitive auction, you are more aggressive. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 8 HCP, a quality suit, and a 5 card suit for ten points. Admittedly the @SJ is somewhat dubious. And you can overcall at the 2-level with 10 points with a nice suit which North has.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|1Np|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has a tough bid. 2@H is slight underbid and 3@H is a slight overbid.|

PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By ducking the @DA (and giving up a diamond trick), notice that declarer ended up taking one fewer trick. Admittedly, not a big deal in IMPs, but very important in Match Points.|

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass by North is fine especially at this vulnerability. However, with only 3 cards in the majors, nice clubs (admittedly only 6), all the points in the 2 long suits, and 6-4 distribution, I think 3@C would be a reasonable bid.|
