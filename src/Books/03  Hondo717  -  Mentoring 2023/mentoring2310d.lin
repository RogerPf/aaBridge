mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 1st and 3rd seat I would open my hand 3@S for sure. But in 2nd seat you need to be a bit more circumspect. That is because partner is more likely to be strong and you don't want to preempt him.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That does not mean you should not preempt in 2nd seat. It just means you should be a bit more disciplined particularly at what is called "unfavorable" vulnerability (your side vul, their side not). |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So rather than opening 3@S I will open 2@S because I have a weak suit a flat hand (no singletons or voids), and only 4 HCP.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is should West bid 3@H or 4@H. In 2/1 game forcing system the principle of "fast arrival" applies and 3@H is stronger than 4@H.. Fast arrival means if you jump to game once you are in a game force you have little slam interest.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should love having 2 heart honors and 17 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at| --14 HCP, one length point, one quality suit point, and one point for doubleton diamond.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So West can bid 3@H which shows around 16 or a good 15 at least.|

mb|3H|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East should also be interesting in slam and start control bidding. The bid here is 3@S. Some player, erroneously, might confuse 3@S as showing three spades. The auction established hearts as trump and now the control bidding starts. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S shows first or second round control in spades. You make the cheapest control bid you can. By "cheapest" I mean the lowest possible bid. In this auction a 3@S bid is cheaper than a 4@D bid.|

pg| ***** 57 ***** |


mb|P|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should bid 4@D that conveys 2 messages. West has first or second round control in diamonds and just as importantly West does not have first or second round control in clubs. So bypassing a 4@C control bid means West does not have a club control which is extremely useful on this hand to know.|

mb|4D|mb|P|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East bids 4@H because he knows their side has two club losers and has no chance to make slam against correct defense. Control bidding is good to learn.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a great question. Marty Bergen would recommend it, even though only 14 HCP, the 5- card quality spade suit adds 2 additional points to the hand. Had West had the same hand but with a 5-card minor rather than a 5-card major, then 1N is better than opening 1 of a minor.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with such nice spades and theoretically 14 HCP, I think 1@S is as good if not better than 1N bid. However, in general you should open 1N with a 5 card major any time you have a 15-17 balanced hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a non-club lead, EW will make 7. But exploring for slam was appropriate to let them find out they lacked a club control.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has a 1N opener despite 5-4-2-2. However, North should be concerned about 2 doubletons and particularly because I am a passed hand. To get 15-17 across, with 4 spades and a 5-card minor opening 1 of the minor is probably okay because you can then rebid 1@S if partner respond 1@H.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you open 1@D and I bid 1@H or 1@S, your 2@C bid is not that descriptive. And if you rebid 1N, you have underbid your hand. Therefore, particularly in 3rd seat, best is to make a slightly flawed 1N opener.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This turns out not to be such a great contract. Not that 3N is such a great contract but if North opens 1@D, we end up in 2@D rather than 3N.
