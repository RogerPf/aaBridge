mb|1N|mb|3C?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An okay bid by East. If you have a nice 7 card suit you should preempt even after a 1NT opener. Now I have a pass. However, if I wanted to bid, a double by me is just "value showing", not penalty per se. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea is it is unlikely I have that much in clubs since partner has at least 2 and the opponent has 7. Therefore, my double just would say "it is our hand. Do something intelligent". |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 3@C was a good choice. Had East chosen to pass, South should pass and many Wests would pass as well (although I would make a 2@D DONT bid, showing diamonds and a major). |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 1NT, North has 7 likely tricks -- 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs, and a diamond giving their side a score of 90. 3@C down 2 would give them a score of 100. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in IMPs, both results are equivalent. In Match Points, +100 is higher than +90, so 3@C down 2 is slightly better for North-South than 1NT making 1.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen himself feels that it is easier to judge when to bid game opposite 10-12 than 7-9. So he prefers playing 3@C as showing 7-9 and 3@D as 10-12. I think he has a point though I also think it is a minor detail.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has no clear lead. You try not to lead away from honors. You also don't want to lead a suit with an ace or a trump on this hand. So it is a tossup between leading spades or diamonds.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It certainly was a reasonable contract but tough hand to play with the 4-1 break. And even if trump broke 3-2, the diamond finesse needs to work in order to make or the club finesse. You could end up losing 1 heart (with 3-2 hearts) 2 clubs and a diamond on a bad day.|
