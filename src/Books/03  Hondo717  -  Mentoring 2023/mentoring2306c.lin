nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to discuss my methods over the 1NT overcall because I think some might find it interesting. If I were West I would bid double which shows a single suited hand Then East bids 2@C over the double and West bids their suit.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 2@D would show diamonds and a higher suit in general. However, in this case, since East opened 1@H, West would bid 2@H with hearts. Therefore, 2@D here would show diamonds and spades. It is correct that you lose the penalty double if playing this style. |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me comment on East's defense. At trick nine East must not discard a diamond on the @CA, which makes his @DK singleton. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By doing so, he allowed declarer to win 4 diamond tricks rather than the two diamond tricks to which declarer is entitled. East must discard a heart.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding North's declarer play, it was a bit risky in IMPs. There was no need to take the diamond finesse. North can count 9 sure tricks - 3 hearts, 1 diamond, and 5 clubs. By taking the diamond finesse, North risks going down. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose East held AJxx of spades, rather than AJx. He would win the DK, and play a spade to West's SK. North would end up losing 4 spade tricks and one diamond trick and go down one in a contract he should have made.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double by North is unlimited in terms of how strong the hand is. So it is possible that we have game. However, 5@C is unlikely regardless. And because West bid 2@D, it is not that likely that North has a diamond stopper. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I will make the slight underbid of 3@C because I have no better alternative. I am not quite strong enough to bid 3@D as a stopper ask.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is lots of upside in Match Points but in IMPs, the extra 100 we get for the double (assuming we only beat them 1) is not worth the risk of doubling them into game.|

It is a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| bid because North knows we have a 9 card fit and is, therefore, willing to compete to a 9 trick contract. He could bid something else if he wanted to invite game. 3@H is merely competing.|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


mb|3S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is rather unclear as to whether or not East should bid 3@S. Admittedly, West will often have 6 spades. So it could then meet the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at|. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let us discuss the earlier 2@S bid by West which doesn't show extra. It is just nice spades.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The opponents have already shown they own about half the deck at least since North opened and I raised. Therefore, it is clear that the points are evenly spread. So any bid West makes over 2@H is just competing and shows a good suit and usually heart shortness.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to to 3@S. If West has 6 spades, which is often the case, particularly since East knows that West is short in hearts, with 3-card support and we have a 9+ card fit, then 3@S is the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| bid. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That it is okay to bid to the 3-level with an 8-card fit, when you have shortness in the opponents suit by invoking the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at|.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I would be a bit concerned and might choose to pass in IMPs because 4-3-3-3 is bad distribution and East has some defense. Further, it is possible that both 3@H and 3@S are going down.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, I think 3@S is the better choice than pass. The favorable vulnerability (EW not vul, NS vul) is what breaks the tie for me.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S was a reasonable bid but pass happens to work better here. In 3@H, we probably lose a heart, 2 spades, 2 clubs, and a diamond for down 2 or at least 2. Therefore, it was better for E/W defending 3@H.|

open 1@C.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I don't like to do that in 2nd seat, since it is more likely partner has cards given one opponent has already passed, although, I do like to be aggressive not vulnerable vs. vulnerable.|
