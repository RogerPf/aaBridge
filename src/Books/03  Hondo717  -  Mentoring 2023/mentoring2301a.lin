However, on this sort of auction, with only a singleton, if I had an outside entry, I might consider leading a diamond. But since I don't I will lead a heart (although a diamond lead turns out to work out better).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, over 4th suit forcing opener has several choices. The first choice is to raise responder's original suit with 3-card support. Clearly that does not apply here. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd choice is to bid 2N with a stopper in the 4th suit. That is one possibility here. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3rd is to make another descriptive bid. So 3@C is certainly possible to describe the 5-5 hand. I don't mind the 2@D bid by West, as I do think that is a game forcing hand, although I would be worried about the misfit in partner's suit. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another possibility is for West to have bid 3@S over 2@C. That is not forcing but highly invitational and shows a very nice suit. I think on this particular auction I like 2@D more.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is what is known as a ^*BNegative Inference^*n and is an important part of bridge. Quite often you can figure out what partner has by what they don't bid as well as by what they do bid.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, because North did not make a negative double, I can figure out they don't have 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 6-4 distribution and a heart void, 2@S is reasonable, though it is a bit risky because of the vulnerability and the fact that North bid 1N and the spade suit is very weak. In this board, luckily partner has great spade support and spades happen to break 3-2.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, it is quite possible on this auction that West could end up losing 3 spade tricks and North might even be able to double. So I think 2@S is ok but risky.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I think East might venture a 2@H bid over 1N. Although new suits by responder are usually forcing on this auction 2@H is not forcing. So any new suits after a 1N bid by an opponent is the one case where new suits by responder are not forcing. |

up|20|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When one of the opponents makes a NT bid that defines their range, it is usually very easy to figure out how many points partner has once you see dummy. For example, East showed 20-21 by bidding 2N. West (Dummy) has 8. That means they have 28-29 HCP. I have 12. Therefore, I know partner has zero since 28 + 12 = 40. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again expert defenders count out distribution and high cards when they can. Additionally, I know partner has at most 1 heart because East has at least 4 from the bidding, dummy has 5,and I have 3 leaving at most 1 for partner. |

East/West probaly have at most 23 HCP (16 + 7) and hearts are not running. Further, there may be no entries to the East hand even if East has Axxxxx of hearts.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out East was correct in being hesitant bidding 2@H. Because of the bad trump break and partner not having a good hand the 4@H was doomed.|
