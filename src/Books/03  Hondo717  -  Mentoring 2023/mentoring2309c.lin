cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people open 1@D when 4-4 in the minors but I actually prefer to open 1@C unless my diamonds are much better than my clubs. In this case North's clubs were much better than their diamonds. However, if you are more comfortable opening 1@D, that is fine and more standard.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I like to open 1@C rather than 1@D is it keeps the bidding lower. One of the most awkward auctions is 1@D-P-1N. Opening 1@C makes it much less likely you will have the awkward auction.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because we can make 5@H and if you are only down 3 in 5@C that is better. Playing double dummy you are down 3 in 5@C. Further, this does also illustrate the power of distribution.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Both East and West had no shortness (singleton or void). Had there been some short suits in either hand (for example say hearts were 3-1) then down less. Regardless,5@C bid was correct.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to 2@C. I like it because I like to strain to bid 2@C over 1@D. It has some preemptive value in that it makes it much harder for the opponents to find their major suit fit. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, some players would say without a 6-card suit or a singleton, 2@C was too aggressive. I don't agree. But keep in mind that to overcall at the 2 level you should normally have a 6-card suit or a 3 honor 5-card suit. If you have a singleton in opener's suit you can shade a little to overcall at the 2 level.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, when there are 2 passes, on average the two opponents have around 16 HCP between them more or less. That means 3rd and 4th seat have about 24. Therefore, you can bet West has approximately 16 points if you subtract my 8 HCP.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D says nothing about diamonds. it simply denies 4 spades and 4 hearts had I not bid hearts. Then East can bid 3N.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West line of play was fine. unfortunately there was an awful diamond break. Had diamonds broken better 3N makes. To repeat, in IMPs I don't mind being in 3N but in Match Points 2N is better--East should pass.|

So he has a clear pass since East only bid 2@S which is limited to 15 or maybe 16.|
