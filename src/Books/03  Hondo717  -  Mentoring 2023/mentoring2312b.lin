pg| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S did its job in that it makes it hard for me to bid. I know partner likely has one spade (or perhaps none) since I have 3 and they have a 9+ card fit. Partner probably does not have a 5 card heart suit, and unlikely we can make 5 of a minor. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I reluctantly have to pass, particularly in IMPs, though in Match Points I would be more concerned. In IMPs there is a good chance we can go plus and if we don't go plus, it is unlikely we can make anything.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We did okay in IMPs at least since we can not make game. Our best spot is a partial in clubs
and assuming we don't peek and notice the @HQ is doubleton, we lose one club, one heart, and one spade tricks making 4@C if we get there. So the 3@S bid was very effective. Also, as East mentioned we can make 5@C if we play for doubleton @HQ offside. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not totally double dummy if we discover that East has the @DQ and @CK because that makes it much less likely given East's 3@S call that the @HQ is onside. Plus if it is, that means West opened with 10 HCP. So we might actually figure it out.|

In 2/1 Game Force, a 2NT rebid is defined as the ^*BDefault Rebid^*N, meaning you bid 2N if no other bid is better. In general, you don't want to bid 3 of a minor unless you have a 5 card suit or a nice 4 card suit as it takes up a lot of room.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And since East does not have 6 spades and has very mediocre diamonds, not to mention he has both minor suits stopped the 2N default bid is clearly best. However, even if he only had one minor suit stopped 2N would be correct. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But most players use the Bergen/Hardy version of 2/1 where 2N is the default bid. Mike Lawrence plays that 2@S would not promise 6 spades and that is a really horrible way to play IMO. His version of 2/1 is very inferior and I don't even understand why he advocates it.|

pc|C6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is not such an easy hand to play. Let's do some planning. East can count three diamonds, three clubs, one heart, and one spade for 8 tricks. Setting up two extra spade tricks is probably the easiest.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East made 12 because of the lucky diamond break. So they should not be in slam. The double dummy analyzer would say 12 tricks, but that is why you need to be more analytical because 12 tricks only makes because both spades and diamonds broke very fortunately. Most of the times declarer can make only 10 or 11 tricks.|
