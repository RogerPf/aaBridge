mb|1N|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a convention called |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?ndf=crawlingstayman,Crawling Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| that I could use here. It is a special form of ^*bGarbage Stayman^*N. In response to partner's 1NT, normally, you should only bid |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=stayman convention,Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| with at least an invitational hand.|

PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with less than an invitational if you have diamonds, hearts, and spades, you can bid ^*bGarbage Stayman^*N in which you bid 2@C, intending to pass whatever response partner makes (including 2@D).|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at||CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?ndf=crawlingstayman,Crawling Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| is similar but not identical. Again, you bid 2@C. If partner bids 2@D, you then bid 2@H. That tells partner you want to play in either hearts and spades but have a weak hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then partner either passes with better hearts or corrects to 2@S with better spades. I could use that convention with this hand. But I think because I have 5 spades and 4 hearts, a simple transfer is better intending to pass 2@S by partner.|

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have 17 HCP, North has at least 15, so there are only 8 HCP between partner and me. Therefore, your side rate to have at most 21 or 22 HCP. In fact, most expert pairs would consider a 2NT bid by West in this auction to be a takeout bid for the minors.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So personally I might pass, but if you want to bid, I would think 3@C is not a bad choice. Do you want an undo or not?|

PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are two good points to this hand in terms of hand evaluation. One, is you should stretch to bid close games with a 9 card fit and be more conservative with an 8 card fit.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point is that, although officially Bergen hand evaluation does not discount for 4-3-3-3 distribution, that would not be a bad idea, if you wanted to subtract 1 for that distribution. In that case East is only worth 11, and clearly a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, East could not bid 3@H over 1@H. A direct limit raise promises 4 card support. If you have a 3 card support and play 2/1 GF with forcing NT you show a limit raise by bidding bid a forcing 1N followed by 3 of opener's suit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a pretty good hand. If vulnerable, particularly given the singleton in their suit, and playing IMPs I might consider bidding 4@S. But that could be somewhat of an overbid. Therefore, I will only bid 3@S here.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Please note that the 3@D preempt made it harder for us to bid. Had East only bid 2@D, I would easily bid 3@S. Fortunately, after my bid North has a clear 4@S call anyway.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely played by North. A little lucky but good declaring makes its own luck. It turns out because of the lucky heart and club position we make 6, though we should not be in slam.|
