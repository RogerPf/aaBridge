pc|H2|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the lead I choose. Club and Spade lead are incorrect based on the auction and the spade holding. Leading from the doubletons Diamonds, although works out here, is often not a good lead and should generally be avoided.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I may not even make four. I can end up losing 1 spade, 2 clubs, and a diamond if I guess the spades wrong, and the minor suit finesses don't work.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand the cards allow me to take the spade finesse against either opponent. And it was a pure guess as to which opponent had the @SQ. So I decide to deliberately take the spade finesse the wrong way (since I can see all the hands). |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, I can demonstrate that, despite the fact that North had a very strong hand possibly worth exploring for slam, the contract could actually go down if both minor suit finesses lost and declarer misguessed who had the @SQ.|

Anytime you let the opponents play in an 8-card fit when the points are evenly split that rates to be at best average and often below average.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good question. If you use the Bergen "OBAR" philosophy (which stands for Opponents Bid And Raise), a bid by East does not show values, but is simply ^*BPre-Balancing^*n. |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play of the hand, North can only count eight tricks for sure (five diamonds, two spades, and a club). Once he loses the lead, he knows it is likely he is going down because even if spades are 3-3, he will also lose three hearts and a club. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best line is to unblock the @SA as he did. Then cross to the board and cash the @SK, run diamonds, and hope he gets an extra club trick.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think a heart honor was the best lead. I also think that East probably, at trick one, should not have ducked the @CA, unless they play ^*BCoded Jacks^*n leads where the @CJ denies a higher honor.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*yShould North bid 3C?^^N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although you sometimes open 3@C with a 6-card suit (since 2@C is not a weak 2) I recommend you only do that in the following situations.
a) first seat if you have a singleton or void
b) almost never in 2nd seat.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because in 2nd seat, there is a much better chance that partner has some strength once an opponent has passed. So although you should preempt in 2nd seat, your preempts should be more solid and less aggressive to avoid preempting partner.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, however, you should almost always open 3@C with a 6-card suit and less than an opener, as in this hand.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Preempting in 3rd seat is very effective as 4th seat will usually be strong after 2 passes where 3rd hand is weak. So North needs to pass.|

PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To open 2@C you should have at least four |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| and your hand should be able to take 9 tricks.

PG| ***** 83 ***** |


SB|S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 6 hearts to the AKQ meaning there are 7 hearts out in the other 3 hands. So my partner on average partner will hold 2 1/3 hearts (7/3) meaning, since partner will hold 2+ hearts more often than not if they break 3-2, I have six heart tricks. With my 2 other aces that makes at least 8 tricks.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly with a 5-card suit, diamonds, the other three hands have eight cards between them meaning partner will have 2 2/3 cards in diamonds. So I rate to take another diamond or two.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All that counting aside, I really like my hand and will open 2@C. I would not, however, object it if you chose to open this hand 1@H.|

sb|s|
mb|2C|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people (not me) play that if partner opens 2@C and you have a bust hand you bid 2@H. A bust hand is one you have no aces and kings and only a few points and (this varies a bit) you have less than 2 queens and 5 or fewer HCP.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't like 2@H as a bust because I like to play that 2@C forces you to game (unless the 2@C bidder rebids 2N). The reason some people play 2@H as a bust is they are allowed to pass below game. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I don't like the 2@H bust approach because a) if opener has hearts, it makes the auction very awkward and wrong sides the contract, and b) opener often rebids 2N anyway and responder can pass.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I needed some luck to make 4@H, but not that much. 3-3 hearts or 3-2 diamonds with the @DK onside. I probably don't ruff the @DQ but turns out not to matter.|

So I like North's pass.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*yWould you bid 2S with East hand?^^N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S turns out it would work reasonably well on this board. However, in second seat you will often preempt partner. And you do have a very ratty weak-2 bid, although I love the 6-4 distribution. In first seat, at this vulnerability, I might bid 2@S and definitely in 3rd seat. I would pass in second seat.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this specific auction, where opener starts with one of a minor and there is a 1@H overcall the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=negativedoubles,Negative Double^*N|CP||FP||at| has a very specific meaning. It shows exactly four spades. A 1@S bid shows 5+ spades. Many players do not appreciate how important length is.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You always show a major when partner opens 1 of a minor. In fact, if you raised diamonds here, that denies a major.|

mb|P|mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, since you know I am likely 5-4 or 5-5 in the minors you can bid 3@D which is not forcing, just invitational even if North were not a passed hand.  and that makes it very easy for me to bid 3N. Some players think 3@D is forcing.|

pc|H7|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I can count two hearts, four diamonds, two spades, and one club for 9 tricks. If diamonds break I have 10 tricks and can afford to take the club finesse. It is unlikely I will take more than 10 tricks, but I will run diamonds and see if there are any discards that help me.|
