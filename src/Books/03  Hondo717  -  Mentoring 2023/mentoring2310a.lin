up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West did well to play hearts and set up a 4th heart for a discard. But then West should hope clubs are 3-3, and draw 3 rounds of trump ending in dummy, and if they are 3-3, can discard a spade loser and make one more trick. And if they are not 3-3, then it doesn't matter.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that if we lead spades, West only has one spade loser.
East/West make 1@H. So the balancing double accomplished its goal. It is rarely right to let the opponents play at the 1 level.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, East was a little light. Although these days, the tendency is to make light takeout doubles. Regardless, East is a bit light and the double was aggressive considering the partner was a passed hand.|

mb|1C?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner were a passed hand, I would preempt 3@S despite my strength. That still might be the best bid. However, I am really too strong for 3@S. So I bid 1@S.|

That means North should not make a non-forcing bid below 4@S. With a stronger hand, can make some forcing bid to show strength.|
