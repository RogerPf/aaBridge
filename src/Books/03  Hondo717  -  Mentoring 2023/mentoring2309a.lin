PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is possible but, particularly given the vulnerability, I think unusual 2N is a better bid.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a system called Unusual over Unusual that East can play. Probably she plays it differently than I do. Next is a small section from my tutorial as how I play unusual over unusual.|

bt||
cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Here is how I play - ^*bUnusual over Unusual.^*n^^|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|
1) It always applies over unusual 2N (since that shows 2 lower unbid suits) and over club and diamond Michaels bids (where the suits are always both majors). It does not apply over major suit Michaels bids (where the suits are the other major and an unspecified minor).|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|

2) There are 2 Cue bids available. 1 cue bid shows a limit+ raise in opener's suit. The other cue bid shows a game force with 5+ cards in the 4th suit (the suit that neither opener nor the opponents have).|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|

3) Over the cue bid that shows the limit+ raise, opener's most likely rebids are either 3 or 4 of their suit. Opener would bid 3 with a minimum hand, not enough to go to game opposite a limit raise and 4 when they are strong enough. New suits are control bids, looking for slam.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|

4) Over the cue bid that shows the game forcing hand, opener makes an appropriate bid. Opener can just bid game in the 4th suit with 3+-card support. Opener can bid 3 of the 4th suit, which is a slam try, showing 3-card support and more than a min opener (16+). They can also rebid their suit. Cue bids in one of the opponents suits are a slam try in the 4th suit.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

5) ^*BAs to which cue bid means which option. I think it is easier to remember if you play that the lower cue bid shows the lower suit and the higher cue bid shows the higher suit. Thus, over the unusual NT, 3@C shows hearts and 3@D shows spades. For example, if opener started with 1@H, 3@C shows the limit+ raise in hearts and 3@D shows the forcing to game hand with spades. On the other hand, if opener opened 1@S, 3@C shows a game forcing hand with hearts and 3@D shows the limit+ raise in spades.^*n|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|

Some experts (as outlined earlier) play that the lower cue bid always shows the limit+ raise and the higher cue bid shows the game forcing hand in the 4th suit. There is nothing inherently wrong with playing that way. I just think it is harder to remember. If you play that way, if opener opened 1@H, 3@C shows the limit+ raise in hearts and 3@D shows the game force with 5+ spades (same as the way I play). However, if opener opened 1@S, 3@C shows the limit+ raise in spades and 3@D shows the game force in hearts.|

PG| ***** 47 ***** |


mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now in this bidding cycle if East bids 3@H that is just some moderate raise, less than a limit raise. 3@S is also not forcing, just showing nice spades and 10ish points.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, since North has shown clubs and diamonds, there are two cue bids are available - 3@C and 3@D. I think the easiest way to play is to say that the lower cue bid shows the lower major (hearts) and the higher cue bid shows the higher major (spades).|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would play 3@C shows a limit raise or better in hearts and 3@D shows a game forcing or close to game forcing hand in spades. However, East plays that 3@D shows the limit raise in hearts and 3@C shows the strong spade hand.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also the other possible bid, not relevant here, is double which says you are willing to defend at least one of the two minor suits. Further, to make east happy we will accept East's treatment of 3@D as showing a limit raise in hearts (or better).|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, it is not clear that East has a limit raise because most of her points are in the minors which do not fit well with partner.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Please note that the 2N made it hard for them to bid which preempts often do. I think West always has to lose 3 aces and the @SQ.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*N How do you get a limit raise with East hand?|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not taking into account the bidding East hand is worth 10 or 11--9 HCP, less 1 for singleton K, plus 3 for singleton with 4 trump.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But given the bidding, the singleton K might not be worth anything (although it turns out it is) and although the @DK increases in value (because it is well placed behind the 2N bidder) it does not fit well with partner.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I guess the way I would evaluate the hand is not count the @CK as anything but count 4 points for the @DK. Using that method, the hand is probably just barely a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with 7 points in the opponent's suit out of 9 I would probably downgrade the hand and bid 3@H. It is hard to say. I do agree with the 4@H bid however given the limit raise by East.|

mb|1D|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would also pass with the North hand, but in general over 1@D you should strain to bid 2@C even if you are a tad light. The reason is that 2@C over 1@D has preemptive value in that it makes it much harder for the opponents to find a major suit fit.|

PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's declarer points are 7 HCP (the @HJ is worthless), plus one length point, plus two for a singleton, and plus one for outside 4 card suit. That is 11 at best.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I love the double fit in diamonds and spades and if East had a 5th spade, they might try for game because, particularly in IMPs, you should be aggressive with a 9 card fit. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with only an 8 card fit, and as little as 22 or 23 combined points I think pass is the best choice.|

PG| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East did not have 3 spades (different deal) then East should bid 2N with a diamond stopper otherwise he makes whatever bid is appropriate.|

mb|2S|SB|N|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should bid 3@S to establish he wants to play in spades. 2@D established a game force. 3@S rather than 4@S agrees to spades and shows slam interest. Then East can start a control sequence.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West can bid 4@S but 4@D is better as East has some slam interest. That shows lack of a club control and a diamond control. It shows first or second round control in diamonds. And because he did bid 4@C he denied club control (lack of the CA or CK). You make the cheapest control bid you can.|

mb|P|mb|5D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should do the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=queenask,Queen Ask^*N|CP||FP||at| by bidding 5@H. As a general rule, once you try for slam, you should bid slam if you have all 5 key cards or 4 key cards and the trump queen.|

mb|5H|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East would bid 5@S on this hand since he lacks the @SQ. If he had the @SQ, he would bid his cheapest king (6D). However, after 5@H bid by West as the queen ask East bids 5@S lacking the SQ.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*yDo you know what North could lead?^^N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As North I do not sure what to lead. Leading a spade is definitely incorrect on this auction. I don't like a heart lead either given the 1@H opener. I probably lead the @DA although that could be wrong also and does violate my don't lead unprotected aces rule. Unfortunately, any lead violates one of my opening lead rules. |

pc|h2|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer has 10 sure tricks and needs one diamond ruff. One way to play the hand is to win the @HQ and play a diamond.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*NHoward, please tell me why a trump lead in this board was bad.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NBecause you know I am missing the trump queen, therefore, by leading a trump, immediately, you give me a free finesse.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Exactly. Excellent reasoning.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*NWest can finesse South if she needs to, she only knows I have the diamonds.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well maybe she will and maybe she won't. West knows you have diamond cards but not diamond length. However, if you lead a trump you guarantee she will play the suit correctly.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NFurther, aren't the percentages slightly better for trump to be 3 - 1?|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, a 3-1 break is around 50% 2-2 is 40%. However, with no information from the bidding playing for the @SQ to drop is slightly better. That is why leading a trump is not a good idea for the defense.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*NBut West knows I have the diamonds.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction, the important point is, if you lead a spade you are making it easier for declarer as you are locating the queen for her.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, in general you should avoid leading a singleton trump unless you know they have a 10 card fit.|
