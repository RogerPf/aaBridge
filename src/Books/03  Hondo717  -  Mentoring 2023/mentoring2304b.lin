up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few minor points. Although in modern bridge you lead A from AK on opening lead, in the middle of the hand you lead K from AK. So West should have led the @CK rather than the @CA at trick 2. In fact an expert would have led the @CJ because when it wins, partner will now know West has @CAKQJ.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, 2@C by West promised 5 clubs and is often 6. However, West has no perfect call. Dnd if you are going to overcall a 4 card suit, can't beat AKQJ. I probably make a takeout double but that has issues also.|
