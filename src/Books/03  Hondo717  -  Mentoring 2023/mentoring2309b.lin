up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West probably would like to bid again, but has no good options. Sometimes when the opening bid is one of a minor, especially 1@C, where there is some chance that is a 3-card suit I might overcall 1N even without a stopper. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 1@D, which generally shows at least 4 a 1N overcall is a little more of a problem. So I think the double was better, though, 1N is not terrible, and they do have a diamond stopper as it turns out with an 8-card club fit. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, with East having a terrible hand with 4-3-3-3, a partial in clubs is down several. Therefore, letting us make a diamond partial is probably not a terrible result for EW.|

mb|1HD|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bWhat should West bid here?^^1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Theoretically, West could bid 1@S. However, since my double shows spades and West has such a weak suit either pass or 1N are probably better choices. I like 1N which tends to show a good 7 to 10. The spade stopper is slightly iffy but 4 card suit has some value even with all low spots.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|1N|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should bid 2@D over 1N. You need to bid aggressively on competitive hands. I should have at least 3 diamonds and sometimes I might even have 4. So we have at least an 8 card fit and maybe even a 9 card fit.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, 2@D clearly meets the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| since an 8 card fit means an 8 trick contract is fine.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A better defense might have been for West to lead a club rather than a 3rd diamond at trick 5. Then they will get a heart ruff and a 2nd club. However, I made a mistake by asking her to lead a diamond which was my error.|

Occasionally, vulnerability factors in, but not as much as many think. I would bid 4@H with the North hand even if we were vulnerable and they were not.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is reasonable, though, it is a bit risky. The other choice is 5@D. Pass is definitely incorrect. The two best choices are 4@S or 5@D.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The advantage of 4@S is it is one trick lower. Although, if partner only has a 5 card suit it might be a problem as a bad break is more likely on this auction.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@D is possible because East's suit is so strong it can play opposite a singleton or even a void. It is one trick higher. It is a tough decision. That is why you preempt. You make the opponents guess and sometimes they guess wrong.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out both 4@S and 5@D make. But 5@D is a better contract because it does not need a 3-3 break. If spades were 4-2, 5@D makes and 4@S does not. Again it is hard for East to know which is best. West could easily have had 6 spades.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, as it turns out 5@H doubled is not a good sacrifice unless the opponents misdefend. N/S lose 2 spades, a spade ruff, one diamond for sure, and two clubs. |

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many would be reluctant to bid at the 4 level with such a weak suit. However, an 8 card suit is by definition never really that weak. Look at it this way. There are 5 cards remaining distributed between the 2 hands. That means partner will often have 2 cards in your suit.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means even if they are two low cards you are still taking 6 tricks with your weak suit. The longer your suit is, the weaker it can be and you can still preempt.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, North also had extremely nice distribution. A void and a singleton are wonderful. If for example, if North had 2 spades to the ace, a singleton heart, a doubleton diamond, and 8 clubs to the jack that is not nearly as nice a hand.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case 3@C might be a better bid than 4@C. But with 8-4-1 distribution, I like 4@C. And if the club suit were better, say KJ10xxxxx, I might even bid 5@C. Most players undervalue distribution, though, distribution is extremely powerful and often more important than high card points.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The more distributional your hand is, the more aggressive you want to be regardless of your strength. One of Marty Bergen's favorite expressions is ^*BThe Magic of Voids^*N.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means, and it is definitely true that if you have a void, your hand takes several more tricks with the same strength than lacking the void.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Looking at differently, if you have a void and are playing in a suit, that is just as good as having the AKQ because the opponents can take no tricks in that suit.|

PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, the @CQ is of dubious value on offense and the @HJ is not wonderful with no other intermediates or other honors in the suit. So 2@D is better than 3@C.|
