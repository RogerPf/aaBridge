mb|2S|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is certainly a reasonable bid. However, with 7 hearts and a singleton spade, I think 4@H is slightly better. Note that 4@H is NOT a preempt. It is a constructive bid showing a nice hand. You cannot preempt over a preempt.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|up|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, 3@H happened to work out well on this hand. However, West had a much worse hand than they would on average. North has 5-10, give him 8 HCP on average. East has 11 HCP. Therefore, North and East hold an average of say 19 HCP, leaving 21 HCP for South and West. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means West will have around 10 HCP or more, more often than not. And West in fact can have a weaker hand and 4@H is still a good contract. It is true that 3@H is not a weak bid. It shows a nice opener and it is a reasonable call.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have bid 4@H (wrong on this hand) because it has so much upside. I tend to take calculated risks when there are good rewards if I am right.|

PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Cue Bids are officially not alertable. It is part of the silliness of the ACBL alert procedure. On the other hand, in BBO I think you should alert everything. In live bridge there is a slight chance that, if you alert, partner may be getting "unauthorized information" if they don't remember what their bid is supposed to mean. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


SB|e|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in BBO that is not a problem. On BBOou self alert, and partner does not see your alert. So all your alert does is help the opponents, which is the ethical thing to do IMO. I tend to over alert.|

PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us discuss a method for defending over 2 suited overcalls when both suits are known. As in this case (the suits are hearts and spades). It is called ^*BUnusual over Unusual^*N because it most often occurs over unsual 2NT where both suits are always known.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It also applies to a minor suit Michaels Cue Bid because the suits are always spades and hearts. If you bid one of the suits that the Michaels bidder does not have (e.g. clubs and diamonds in this case) that is just competing and does not show anything particularly strong. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you Cue Bid the lower suit (Hearts in this case) that a nice hand with the lower of the remaining suits (which is clubs here). If you Cue Bid the higher suit (Spades in this case), it shows a nice hand with the higher remaining suit (diamonds here). |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you double, that says you are prepared to double at least one of the opponent's suits. Having said all that, although I have spades, I am not prepared to double 2@S and I don't have particularly nice clubs or diamonds. So I am going to pass.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1N is foricng in 2/1 so West can't pass. Some play it "semi-forcing" meaning West could pass with a weak flat hand. Even if playing that, West has to bid 2@C.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's nice. Why not bid 4@S? That shows the same thing. In fact, 2@H denies 4@S. I play you must raise immediately and any other bid denies 4 spades. I would take 2@H as asking me to bid 2N with a weak response and heart stopper and 3N with a strong response (9+) and a heart stopper.|
