mb|P|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some might open the West hand 3@C. For many reasons which I will elaborate next I think West's choice of pass is much better, even though I love to preempt. The hand has only a 6 card suit though you do sometimes open 3@C with a 6 card suit (since you can't open 2@C as a weak 2).|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East/West are vulnerable. Moreover, in 2nd seat, since 1st seat passed, it is more likely that partner has some values and you have to worry about preempting partner. West sould prefer to have a better suit although I do love the distribution.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 1st seat, opening 3@C has more merit while you should have much more of a standard preempt in 2nd seat than in any other seat. I am not saying you should avoid preempting. I am just saying you should avoid marginal preempts in 2nd seat.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally he has nice support in the majors if partner happens to hold a major. That is another reason not to preempt. Despite what some players believe you should not let an outside 4-card major deter you from preempting.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have an otherwise suitable hand you definitely should preempt. It is much more likely that you want to play in your long suit and the chances of a major suit fit are not that high. The benefits of preempting and disrupting the opponents are much greater than worrying about missing a major suit fit.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |

In general you should also be conservative with an 8-card fit, which I know is what we have and aggressive with a 9-card fit. A 9-card fit is really valuable.|

PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this system West pases if has a positive response to 2@C meaning that he holds at least one ace or king, or has 5+ HCP. However, he doubles if he has a negative response. I am not sure why double doesn't show the strong hand and pass the weak hand.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |

mb|P4s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^*BFast Arrival^*n applies to West's bid. West should bid 3@S if had more than a min 2@C, and since East showed a positive response. However, since West has about the worst hand he could have given the 2@C opener 4@S is best bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't use length points because "the length of your 2 longest suits" takes that into account. Therefore, on this hand, I have 10 HCP and 1 for the 3 honor quality club suit giving me 11 points, enought to open. It turns out even if I didn't open we probably get to game.|

In this case, East's correct lead is the 5. It turns out count is usually more important than attitude. On the other hand, had East supported diamonds then since partner knows she has 3+, she would lead the 9 to deny an honor.|
