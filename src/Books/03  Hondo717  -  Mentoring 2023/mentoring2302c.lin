up|20|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few Kibitzers questioned the 1N bid by North suggesting 2@C instead. I consider 1N is much better than 2@C, despite how it worked out. 2@C, here, would tend to show an unbalanced hand with 5+ diamonds. Further,if the spade finesse works, he would make 3N despite losing 4 club tricks.|

PG| ***** 11 ***** |


MB|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's double gives me more room to bid. One possibility for me is to bid 3@D which asks partner to bid 3N with a diamond stopper. We are likely to take 9 tricks if he has a major suit ace.|

up|24|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@C turned out to be a good bid with no double. In 4@D they lose 1 spade and 2 hearts. More importantly, they can make 4@S.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NHow do we find 4@S?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you decide that East's double is responsive, showing hearts and spades, you could bid 3@S over my 3@D though I am not sure East would bid 4@S over 3@S. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it turns out that the double works out well here, though as I mentioned, I would not have doubled with East's hand.|

I often do in 1st seat if I have an unbalanced hand (e.g. contains a singleton or void). And being at favorable vulnerability makes it even a better bet.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NYou do it without at least 2 top honors?|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't tend to worry about honors when preempting not vul. If I were vul, or perhaps even if both non-vul, I might decide to pass. I admit the hand has several flaws as the club suit is pretty weak and having a 4 card major, also is a flaw.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, because of the vulnerability I think preempting has more upside than downside.|

up|45|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would like to answer several question from the kibitzer about the bidding and the opening lead.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North got lucky by his opening lead. You are not supposed to lead away from an ace in a suit contract. North should have led the @CA. However, since North did not the @CK did not score.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly, since it is likely I have the @CK, leading away from the @CA is likely to work out okay. However, technically it is still the wrong lead.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether North bid 5@C over 4@H as a sacrifice, knowing he would be going down, the answer is yes. At this vulnerability I would bid 5@C. If I have 7 clubs, which I usually do, that gives us an 11 card fit and it is unlikely we are beating 4 hearts. In fact, if North wanted to bid 5@C over 3@H that would be a reasonable tactic. That makes it harder for the opponents to guess what to do. I personally would have either passed with the North hand or bid 5@C.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So at this vulnerability even if we are down 3, it is a good sacrifice. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 5@C, we lose 1 heart, 1 diamond, 1 club, and 2 spades for down 3. So doubled at this vul, is better than letting them make 4@H since it is -500 instead of -620.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N was a very good bid. I have 6 and North had 19. On this auction I usually have clubs. The only worry is that since South denied 4 card major, we might not have a stopper in spades. However, you have to hope for the best, either the SA onside, or not a spade lead, or I have something in spades.|
