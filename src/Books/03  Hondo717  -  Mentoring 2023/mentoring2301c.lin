^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should reopen with a double which is takeout. It is fortunate on this hand that he did not since that gives East a tough choice. I am not sure what I would do over a double with East's hand. I probably bid 2@S, which is not the greatest contract.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H was not an awful contract. depends on the spade finesse plus picking up the hearts (3-2 usually). I have been in worse, but it's around a 40% contract. In IMPs vulnerable, that makes it a potential game. However, not vulnerable you want your game bids to be close to 50%|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, back to opening bid by North. Some play with 3-3 in the minors you open 1@C. They only open 1@D with 3 diamonds with exactly 4-4-3-2 distribution. However, if your style is to open better minor, which I happen to like, then 1@D is reasonable.|
