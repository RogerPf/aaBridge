mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the bid, particularly at favorable vulnerability (you not vul, opps vul) in 1st seat. Many people would be afraid to open such a weak suit. In 2nd seat I would not open this hand 2@S. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2nd seat you need to be a bit more disciplined although you should still preempt when appropriate. The reason being, once an opponent passes, it makes it more likely partner has strength. So you want partner to have a better idea of what you have when you preempt.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4S|SB|S4S is 100% correct bid.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A possible bid by North is 4NT, though, I am not saying he should do it. 4NT has a special meaning in a competitive auction over 4@S. It shows a 2-suited hand with any 2 suits which is what North has, although his clubs are very weak. His spade void is wonderful.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


sb|s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North chose to bid 4N, I normally bid 5@C with any club tolerance for clubs. But I bid 5@D if I am willing to play in either 5@D or 5@H. Regardless, given the vulnerability, and the fact that the hand only has 10 HCP, pass is a reasonable choice.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out 6@C is a great contract. Let us review the bidding and find out how East/West could bid it. West's double is 100% correct. East might have a hand which wanted to make a penalty double of 2@D.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's hand has 9 HCP, spade void, and 7 really nice clubs. So East either should bid 3@C over 2@D by North or bid 4@C after the double by West. In either case, West is strong enough to bid 5@C at least or even be interested in club slam.|

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is okay. However, I either bid 3@D or pass with the North hand. That is just a style thing. I let 2@D to stand.|

mb|2s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East needs to bid more strongly. 2@S is a huge underbid. Here, I might bid 4@S with 4 quick tricks, although @DK might not really be a quick trick. I tend to be an optimist. Particularly if you are vulnerable you want to stretch to bid vulnerable games.|

pc|D9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally you lead count. However, since partner supported me, I know she has 4+ diamonds, so attitude--the--D9--is correct.|

pc|SK|pc|SQ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East played spades the way most would, but it is not necessarily the best way to play the suit. Most of you know the ^*B8 ever 9 never^*N rule for drawing trumps which says you ^*Bnever^*n finesse for the trump queen with a 9 card fit. That is actually incorrect. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With no information from the bidding it turns out that finessing for the queen is only 2% worse than playing for the drop.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| And if someone has shown a long suit, it is much more likely the other defender has Qxx. So on this hand, since I bid 1@D, the spade finesse is actually the percentage play.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good play and good luck helped to make 4@S. 3@S still is the correct spot.|
