In general, leading away from Axxx is slightly more dangerous in terms of giving away a trick than leading for Kxxx. Further, @DA ensures an entry. However, if the diamonds were clearly stronger than the clubs (for example, the diamond suit contained the 10 and possibly the 9 or 8), then a diamond lead would be better.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NIs there a difference between 1N response bid after 1@D vs 1N after 1@c bid?|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


sk||cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, there is a difference. Over 1@C you often can bid 1@D. In fact many play that 1N over 1@C shows 8-10. With 6 or 7 points, 4 clubs, and 3 cards in all the other suits, you bid your 3 card diamond suit (hardly ever happens in real life).|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I really dislike it when responder is forced to make a 1NT response to 1@D. It often gets your side to the wrong contract. If 1NT is passed out, it is less than optimal because the weak hand is declaring. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The defense is leading through the possible major suit tenaces in the stronger hand. Since responder has at most 3 cards in each major, they have 7 or more cards in the minors. That means often a minor suit partial is the better contract. |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Responder has no more than 4 diamonds (with 5+ diamonds responder would make an inverted raise to 3@D) and often has less than 4. So responder normally has club length. But because responder's hand is so ambiguous, it is often hard for opener to decide whether to pass 1NT or play in a minor suit partial.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*nWhat influences your bidding in IMPs vs Match Points scoring?|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points, there is no reward for bidding close games, because if you go down you will get a bad board. So you should not stretch to bid game - you will often get an average or close to it even if you fail to bid game but make some overtricks. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in IMPs, you win a lot of extra imps for making a game contract (because of the game bonus of 300 if not vulnerable and 500 if vulnerable), so you should strain to bid game.|
