nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand is slightly too strong for 1N. If you open 1@S, when you have a spade fit, it makes it easier to bid a slam when responder has an opener with a spade fit.|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason this is better than 4@H right away is because if partner has a strong hand, they can still try for slam.|

mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 3@H by West is reasonable. But once there is a double of 3@C West's @CK gets promoted to almost four 4 points since it is very likely taking a trick.

mb|1C|mb|2C|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a convention called Unusual Over Unusual that some play over an Unusual 2NT (hence the convention name) and also over a Michaels cue bid in the minors, where it is known that the Michaels cue bidder holds both majors. It is a complicated convention. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I won't go into all the details but suffice it to say, if playing that convention, the 2@D bid by North shows a weak hand. If North was stronger, she would cue bid 2@S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given a 10 card fit, I would bid 4@S. The other choice is a cue bid of 3@D. That is extremely conservative but not totally out of line.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5D?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5-level decisions are extremely difficult. But I think this one is relatively easy. If partner has the @SA and little else 5@S is making losing only 2 tricks in the minors.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, because the bridge proverb ^*BThe 5-level belongs to the Opponents^*N is true. That means it is rarely right to bid 5 over 5.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double instead of 5@S would be possible and would work out okay here although not great. Finally, because of the vulnerability and the high likelihood that 5@S is making I think this is a rare case where 5@S is the better call. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |
