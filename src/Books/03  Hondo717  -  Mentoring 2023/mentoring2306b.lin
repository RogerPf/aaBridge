nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether or not North should bid over 2@S, I play something called "OBAR" bidding. OBAR stands for Opponents Bid and Raise which is what happened here.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play that if someone bids immediately after the raise to 2 that does not show strength, it is just competing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play that, then North has a very nice takeout double. The hand is not strong enough if you play standard bidding, but a perfect OBAR takeout double because it just shows shortness in the opponents suit, support for the other suits, and does not guarantee strength.|
