up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think E/W might make 4@S. They only have 3 apparent losers, and that is only because both the diamond finesse and spade finesse lose. The 4-1 spades might cause a problem. By looking at the 2 hands, I would want to be in 4 spades. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That underlines my discussion about stretching over a 2N rebid would have worked out here.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once a fit is found, East's declarer point addons are 2 points for the singleton club and 1 point for the 4+-card side diamond suit. So that gives East 14 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Bergen Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at|. Since West is showing around 20 points, that brings the combined total to 34, which is enough to try for slam. But when West bids RKCB, he discovers they are missing one key card and the @SQ so they end up in 5@S.|

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had East been at favorable vulnerability (their side not vul, our side vul) I would open the hand 2@H. Otherwise, clear pass is the bid even by me.|

mb|1S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2C|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is very likely to be our best spot, and is a reasonable tactic as well. Other bids could be 3@C as a limit raise, or a 4@H |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=splinters,Splinter^*N|CP||FP||at| (although slightly weak for that).|
