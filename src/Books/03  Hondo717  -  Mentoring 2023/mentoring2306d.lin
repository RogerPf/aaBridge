mb|2S|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is certainly reasonable here. Very rare that you get such a strong hand, even after a weak 2 opener. I would be worried about missing slam, but your first goal is to get to your best game.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should double again. That is not penalty per se. It just says you have a strong hand. It is just what is known as a "card showing" double. The first double already indicated shortness in spades.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|D|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What West should do. In general, with a flat hand or a defensive trick or two West should pass. But with a weak unbalanced hand, as West has here they should bid. Here West has a clear 5@C bid with a 6-card suit. Partner already indicated they have some length in clubs.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|5C|mb|P|MB|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I need to decide what to do. I can count 6 spade tricks, a diamond trick for 7, and a club ruff or two for 8 or 9. With 9 tricks, then 5@S doubled is slightly better than letting them make 5@C. On the other hand, in general the rule "The 5 level belongs to the opponents" is a good one.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means you should only bid "5 over 5" if you have a very good reason. Here if I were not vulnerable and they were vulnerable, I would bid 5@S. However, at equal vulnerability I should not. It is possible they are going down, and even if not, it is possible we are down 3.|

mb|3C|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 19 HCP, plus 1 point for 3 honor spade suit, plus 2 length points for two 5-card suit, plus 2 points for singleton, plus 1 point for 4+ card club suit once a spade fit is found for 25 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Bergen Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at|. That is more than enough for slam.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even with that many points, West is worried about 2 club losers. If West merely bids 3@D, that would be a game try, asking East to bid 4@S with a maximum limit raise (11-12). That won't solve the problem of a possible 2 club losers.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To solve this problem I play, which is not standard but quite effective. I play that any bid past 3@S is a control bid looking for slam. Some would play that if West bids 4@D over 3@C, that is a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=splinters,Splinter^*N|CP||FP||at| which happens to work here.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But suppose West had @DAx. I would still want to bid 4@D. Let's play that.|

mb|4D|mb|P|mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West bid 4@D, which shows a diamond control but denies a club control. That makes it easy for East. Now East can then bid 4@H, which shows both a heart control and a club control.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H by East shows a club control because since West already denied a club control. East is not interested in slam unless they have a club control. If they don't, they know their side has 2 club losers.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a very important principle of control bidding. If your partner makes a control bid that shows lack of a control in a particular suit you must not look for slam if you also lack a control in that suit.|

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West knows that their side has all the key cards and the trump queen and 7 is quite possible if East happens to hold the @CA and @CK. West can find out by playing 5N as what is known as ^*b"specific kings"^*n which is a much better way to play than number of kings.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they play specific kings after West bids 5N, East responds with the cheapest king they have if they hold an outside King. So West will then know whether or not East holds the @CK.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, East will bid 6@H, showing the @HK and denying the @CK and @DK and West is content to bid 6@S. Let us try it.|

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If hearts are trump and you use 4NT as RKCB and if responder bids 5@D over 4NT and your side is missing the trump queen and one key card there is no way to do the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=queenask,Queen Ask^*N|CP||FP||at| ask over 5@D when hearts are trump because the queen ask is the next higher suit.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if the RKCB bidder bids 5@H that is obviously to play. And if they bid 5@S, that takes them pass 5@H. Therefore, you can't do the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=queenask,Queen Ask^*N|CP||FP||at| ask in that specific auction.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are more likely to want to do the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=queenask,Queen Ask^*N|CP||FP||at| ask when partner has 1 key card than 0 key cards. So if you reverse the meaning of 5@C and 5@D, you can do the queen ask when partner has 1 key card (responds 5@C) because you can bid 5@D.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you still can't do the queen ask when partner responds 5@D. As you can see, it is a rather obscure and not particularly valid reason that 1430 was invented.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days there is a better solution anyway. That is to use 4@S ask RKCB when hearts are trump rather than 4N. That way if partner responds 4N over 4S (0 or 3) you can bid 5@C as the queen ask.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if partner responds 5@C over 4@S (1 or 4) you can bid 5@D as the queen ask. All of which are below 5@H. It is called |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=kickback,Kickback^*N|CP||FP||at|.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, many good players, myself included, play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=kickback,Kickback^*N|CP||FP||at| for all suits. 4@S is RKCB when hearts are trump, 4@H is RKCB when diamonds are trump, and 4@D is RKCB when clubs are trump. We do it because then we can easily do RKCB for a minor suit and be able to stop in 5@C or 5@D if necessary.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I should add that there are occasionally times when it is not clear if a bid is RKCB or not. However, I think it is much better than always using 4N as RKCB. I strongly recommend you click blue |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=kickback,Kickback^*N|CP||FP||at| and study my tutorial.|

He could figure out that North only has 1 trump left in their hand. Therefore, at trick seven he should ruff the club, play the @SQ drawing the last trump, and get out with a diamond or a heart.|

mb|5C?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure what I would do with the East hand. However, if East passes, that is what is known as a "Forcing Pass" and West cannot pass. East voluntarily bid game. Once you do that, and the opponents bid what appears to be a sacrifice your side must either double or bid one higher. If East passes, West should double rather than bidding 5@H.|
