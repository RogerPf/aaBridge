PG| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The advantage being it allows the responder to differentiate between a non game forcing and game forcing hand over a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=reverses,Reverse^*N|CP||FP||at|. But first of all, given North's original pass it really doesn't apply and second of all, I am not a big fan. I think a better way to play reverses is to use 4th suit forcing to show a game forcing hand and otherwise bid naturally.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, one of the main reasons I do not use Lebensohl over Reverses is because of a tournament I was in the New Hampshire State championships. We were doing very well and in the last round we played the best pair who was close to us in terms of score and they used Lebensohl over their reverses on two hands. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because of their Lebensohl approach, they had a very confused auction, ended up in two very bad contracts. They got two bottoms. As a result Ava (my partner) and I won the STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.|

However, I am not a big fan of leading King from KQ on opening leads as it gives away a trick quite often. But no other lead seems any better. As it turns out, the club may work.|

sk|s|pc|C2|pc|CT|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 5 diamonds 2 clubs and a spade for 8 if diamonds are 3-1. My 9th trick will either come from a heart ruff with 3-3 hearts or the very unlikely possibility that East holds the @HA though with the auction that seems unlikely. However, another possibility which is probably better on this hand is that West holds the doubleton @HA. So I will play for that.|

MB|x|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain how most experts play when there is interference over 2@C opener which is very counter intuitive. East assumed, which is reasonable, that double would show a positive response over 2@C. That is certainly a reasonable way to play if that is your agreement. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But experts reverse the intuitive meaning of double and pass. They play double shows a weak hand and pass shows a positive response. So let's use the expert approach and East you pass.|

mb|P|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2S|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East should bid 3@S and not 4@S. The earlier pass by East showing a positive response holding a decent hand. Therefore, "Fast Arrival" applies here. A 4@S bid would deny any slam interest. However, 3@S shows definite slam interest which East should have.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally West would bid 4@C as a control bid. However, with all suits controlled 4N is fine.|

mb|4N|mb|P|mb|5D|SB|EMy bid shows only one Keycard.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should only bid slam if you have all the key cards or 4 key cards and the trump queen. Here West knows they are missing one key card and may decide to bid 5@H which is the queen ask and East would respond 5@S denying the @SQ with pass by West avoiding a slam contract. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


sb|e|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this auction there are several pieces of information which West should conside and bid slam--6@S. First, because North overcalled 2@D, it is likely North is short in spades. Second, West might have 4 spades giving E/W a ten-card spades and West plan on finessing South for the @SQ. So, I suggest West to bid 6@S.|

pc|CQ|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sk|w|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way to play the hand is to win this trick and play the @HK to unblock the suit and then play the @SA in case the @SQ is singleton. If the @SQ does not fall ruff a club followed by playing the @HQ and throw a diamond. After that take the spade finesse. Let us do it.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next is to finesse South for @SQ. With the 2@D overcall by North, the drop is almost a certainty because North is known to have 5 diamonds and probably at least one or probably two clubs left in which case South must have the @SQ.|

up|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a 9-card fit missing the queen, most people always play for a 2-2 break and given no other information, as I said, that is the slightly better play, but only by 2% as it turns out. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if one defender has shown a 5+ card suit then it is better to take the finesse against his partner because it is much more likely that the defender with the long suit is short in trump.|
