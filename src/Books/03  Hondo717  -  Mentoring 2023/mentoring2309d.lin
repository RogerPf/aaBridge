mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not like the pass. North either should double or bid 5@H. My choice is 5@H. It is true that both 5@H and 4@S could be going down.

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, being vulnerable, actually is even more important you bid 5@H because of larger game bonus. And North should double if does not bid 5@H because with an opening hand opposite an opening hand, letting them play in 4@S undoubled is not going to be a good result.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the lack of a double made little difference in IMPs. In Match Points it probably made a bit more of a difference. Further, it turns out, because the club finesse is off, and hearts are 3-1, 5@H goes down.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So other than not doubling this is the best we can do. However, I still think North needs to take some action, and looking at the 2 hands, I think 5@H is a reasonable contract. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have an opener and partner has an opener, you must play in game or double whatever contract they are in. It is correct that North can not open, but once I overcall 3@H, your hand is worth 14 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at|. North has 10 HCP, plus 1 length point, plus three points for the singleton with four trumps, and the fact that it is a singleton in their suit makes it even more valuable.|

mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I probably don't open 1@S with that hand. The @DQ is really somewhat discounted as a singleton.
