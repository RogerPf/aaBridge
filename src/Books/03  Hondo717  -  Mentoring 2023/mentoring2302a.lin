mb|P|mb|1C?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What to do here is a matter of tactics and it is far from clear. However, when in doubt, I make the bid with the most upside.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|4S|mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure I would double with the West hand. Double there is neither takeout nor penalty. It is a "value showing" double. West is saying that he has enough strength where he feels that East-West should either be in game or double North-South, but he is not sure which. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He is leaving it up to partner to "do something intelligent", either leave it in (which is often what partner should do) or pull it to another suit. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, I think West is a little weak to double. He should have close to an opener (at least 10 or 11 points) and the strong possibility of taking at least two defensive tricks.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with the 5@C bid. East would rather play 5@C than defend 4@S.|

mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 3@H is a little bit of an underbid. Admittedly, the 2 minor suit queens are a bit dubious.

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a pretty straight forward play. Declarer should ruff the diamond, draw the last trump, and lose 1 spade at worst. Once again the preempt made it difficult for EW. However, this time they got to their best spot.|

Let me explain my ^*BQuick Tricks Points^*n method of hand evaluation. There are a maximum of 8 ^*BQuick Tricks^*n and there are 40 HCP in the deck. 40 HCP divided by 8 means a ^*BQuick Tricks^*n is "worth" about 5 points.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with each hand, I count my ^*BQuick Tricks Points^*n. In this hand, with 3 ^*BQuick Tricks^*n means I have 15 ^*BQuick Tricks Points^*n. When the ^*BQuick Tricks Points^*n are greater than or equal to the hands HCP, then the hand is worth an upgrade and you should make the more aggressive bid when you have a choice.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So here that justifies me making a marginal takeout double. BTW, there are five great tutorials takeout double on my website in Tutorials section under the Doubles column.|

mb|D|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Responding to takeout doubles is simple. With less than 8 points you make the cheapest bid possible. With a good 8 to 11 you jump. With a game forcing hand (e.g. opener) you cue bid. Here, North should bid 2@S.|
