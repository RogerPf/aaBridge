up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The club lead ended up giving declarer their 9th trick as you can see. Leading away from a single honor (not sequence) often does give away a trick. Also, although North knows the contract is assured once the @DJ appears at trick 4, it is safe to play for an overtrick.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick six, before drawing trump he should cash the @SJ to unblock the suit and then draw 2 rounds of trump followed by playing the @SK to discard the losing heart and make 4.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Managing your entries is an important declarer skill.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A Kib questioned whether North could pass since the hand is balanced, would pass have been better? Balanced means the hand has no singletons or voids. It is true that balanced hands are not nearly as strong as unbalanced hands with equivalent high card points.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if North had a marginal bid, he would choose the more conservative action and perhaps pass or bid less than he would otherwise. However, you should preempt whenever you have a suitable hand. If you wait for the ideal hand you will never preempt.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, with 6 diamonds and 5-10 HCP, North has a clear 2@D opener IMO.|

PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Those rules are HCP, add 1 for quality suit (3 honors and 4+ cards), subtract 1 for dubious shortness, add one if aces/tens exceed queens/jacks by 3 or more, and subtract 1 if queens/jacks exceed aces/tens by 3 or more.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case my adjusted points are 11 HCP minus 1 for KQ of diamonds (dubious shortness) giving me 10. After adding 9 cards in the majors I have 19. So theoretically I should not open. However, I really like this hand with its intermediate cards (tens, nines, and (not on this hand) eights). So I will stretch and open 1@H.|mb|1H|

mb|P|mb|1H|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is okay, but I like 3@D much better because not vulnerable against vulnerable, you want to aggressively preempt when appropriate.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


mb|2H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P3h|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West clearly meant 3@H as invitational. However, many experienced players play that 3@H is just "competitive" meaning they do not play it as an invitational bid. If they want to invite, they make some other bid such as a new suit. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they bid 3@H they are just "pre-competing" meaning they assume if they pass the opponents will compete. Because they should compete whenever it goes 1x-P-2x-P-P-?, it is almost always right for the person in pass out seat to compete.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Letting the opponents play at the 2 level when the points are approximately even between the 2 sides is losing bridge. Therefore, (with another hand) if West passes and they are playing against good players, North will do something to compete. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For that reson, many play that the 3@H bid is anticipating that the opponents will compete and they are simply bidding 3@H because they intend to bid 3@H over whatever the opponents bid. If West wants to make a game try, they need to bid something else. In this case 2@S for example. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So let us undo the bid and count West's |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Bergen Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at| to see what West should do.|

PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case if he figures out I have the @HJ and starts with a low heart he can finesse against my @HJ. He would end up losing only 1 heart trick rather than 2. Although many players like to play high cards to entice defenders to cover, most good defenders don't fall for that. So there was no point in wasting the @H9 which turned out to be fatal.|

First, let us discuss what is the difference between 3@S, 4@S, and a cue bid of 4@C by East. 4@C should be reserved to a game forcing hand with nice trump and East definitely should not bid that.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, East could stretch to bid 4@S with slightly less than game forcing values perhaps a good 11 or 12, particularly with 4 spades or 3 nice spades. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, East has 10 points and spades are not wonderful. And the @CK, although well placed (meaning because of the 3@C bid it is likely to take a trick) does not fit well with partner. 4-3-3-3 is very bad distribution.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think East is quite strong enough to bid 4@S although it is close. 3NT is also close.

In 1st seat I tend to open 3@C if I have 6 clubs and an unbalanced hand (a singleton or void) and East does meet that requirement.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But because East is vulnerable and we are not and the 6-card suit is prety weak bidding 3@C is a bit risky. So, I think pass is probably best. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if playing against a strong pair, I would open 3@C. If you play against a strong pair, you should be more aggressive not less aggressive because if you are not aggressive, they are likely to beat you anyway. If you disrupt their bidding, you make it harder for them to be accurate.|

Less 2 for Qx and Jx in the minors, plus 2 length points, plus 1 for the quality spade suit, plus 1 point for the 2 doubletons, and plus 1 extra point for my 6th spade once partner raises for 18. That is enough  to bid 4@S but not enough to be in slam.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that if my @CQ and @DJ were in my major suits, the hand would be a lot better and possibly worth exploring for slam. Further, Bergen evaluation accounts for the fact that my minor suit cards are not working.|

pc|H8|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West clearly plays top of nothing leads from 3 small which is fine and many players do that. However, many experts prefer leading count.

PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NShould East have doubled the 3 clubs as lead directing?|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general you should make a lead directing double over an artificial bid when you can. Anything you can do to help partner find the best lead is good.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, it is far from clear that East wants a club lead. If East held the @CA and @CK certainly a double is warranted. But holding K9xxxx there is no reason to think a club lead is the best lead although it happens to be a good lead on this hand.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If spades break 2-1, I have 6 spade tricks and 4 heart tricks for 10 easy tricks. But as I see, they don't break which makes things much more difficult. Therefore, if I play another spade, I am going to lose at least 1 diamond and 2 clubs and a spade for sure for down 1.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My only hope is that West has at least 3 hearts so I can discard a club on my 4th heart. And also have to hope that West has the @DA. Then I only lose 1 diamond not two.|
