nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you bid 4@D, you need to decide what you are going to do if the opponents bid 4@S. You may decide to pass after 4@S bid. That is fine, but do you want to encourage them to bid 4@S? That is the issue you have to consider.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand, and as I said, 4@D is the correct |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| bid, but you then have to be willing to chance that you will encourage them to bid 4@S which they might not otherwise bid.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, it is going to work fine on this hand. Also, please note that 4@D is definitely a weak bid. If West had a limit raise, they might bid 3@S, although they might not. Regardless, 4@D is definitely weak.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@S it turns out North/South lose three clubs, one diamond, and one spade for down one. This was a rare instance where the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| did not work perfectly. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West only bid 3@D, North should still pass, again using the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| because I have 3 spades and North has 5 for a total of 8 spades meaning 3@S is not the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| bid. With a 6th spade North should bid 3@S, or when it comes around to me, I will bid 3@S according to my competitive guidelines. I would bid 3@S if I know we have a 9-card fit (but I don't know that). |

PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other reason to bid 3@S is when you have a singleton in their suit (which I do) and that turns out to be the correct bid over 3@D because 3@D makes and 3@S is only down one. Having said that, 4@D was a good bid that just didn't happen to work out on this hand.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, it also turns out in real life 3@S may make because of a lucky lie of the cards and a slight slip by the defense. And again, although, theoretically 3@S should go down in actual practice it makes so 4@D down one is probably a reasonable result.|

That is a reasonable way to play and fine for most people. Many experts play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lebensohl,LEBENSOHL^*N|CP||FP||at| which is something you should consider.

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But let me discuss a more sophisticated version of ^*BSuper Accept^*n. In that fashion, rather than jumping to 3@H, I bid a new suit which shows 4 hearts and a doubleton in the suit bid. Sometimes that will help you get to game that might not otherwise be bid. So here I am going to bid 3@C which shows four hearts and a doubleton club.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now on this auction, since North bid 1@H and East doubled, the redouble by South is ^*BSupport Redouble^*n showing 3-card heart support. If East, for example, had bid 1@S rather than doubling, then South could double which is |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=supportdoubles,SUPPORT DOUBLE^*N|CP||FP||at| to show 3-card heart support. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In both cases, if South bids 2@H rather than doubling or redoubling, that promises 4-card heart support.

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So here I am going to redouble. That shows 3-card heart support. If I bid 2@H that would promise four hearts. Knowing the number of trump you have can be very important. 9-card fits are great and you should bid aggressively. 8-card fits are not as good so you should be more conservative.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*nShall I bid 1@S? I have four points, four spades, and one singleton.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think you have a weak hand. The @DQ and @HQ, your four points, are dubious, you have bad spades, the singleton is in partner's other suit, and you have four cards in opponent's suits.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Essentially you have no working HCP. If you had the @CQ and @SQ, instead of @DQ and @HQ, your hand would be much better. Sometimes it is not only how many HCP you have but where they are located. So pass is the only choice.|

However, a) the Law is most accurate for 10 card fits and below. It works pretty well but not quite as well with an 11 card fit. and b) We are vulnerable and they are not, and  c) Sometimes you open 3@C with a 6-card suit. Therefore, I will only bid 4@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That would be nice but not legal. You have to either pass or bid a suit. With a singleton club I suggest bidding 4@H as slightly more flexible than 4@S.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a great example of why you preempt. West and East both made reasonable bids, though they ended up in the wrong spot because they had no room to explore. And notice how we defended. We forced East to ruff our clubs and set up trump tricks for South.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is called a ^*BForcing Defense^*n and is often a good way to defend when you have length in trump as a defender. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should not be afraid to make declarer ruff. At worst that is a neutral play and sometimes, as on this hand, it actually shortens declarer's trump and sets up extra tricks for the defense.|

mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with 3@H opener even vulnerable and even with the very mediocre heart suit. But some might pass because the hearts are a bit weak. On the other hand, I believe that aggressively preempting works out better much more often than not.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another alternative is to open 2@H, although I personally have a slight preference for opening 3@H.|

mb|P|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double by North is a bid because it caters to my passing if I have hearts, which is certainly possible on this auction and in Match Points I might pass and lead a diamond and hope to beat it at least one and possible two. But in IMPs that is a bit risky. Another bid North might make is 3@S rather than double.|

mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North was right to bid 4@S over 4@H with a 9 card fit. You should almost always bid 4@S over 4@H when you have a 9+ card spade fit.|
