mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the 2@S bid by East. That tends to show 4 spades, but you can raise with 3 if there is no better call. On this hand, the only other alternative is 1NT. However, with lack of stoppers in both minors, nice spades, and a doubleton, I think 2@S is the better call than 1NT.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North must balance now. If at all possible, you should never let them play at the 2 level when they have an 8+ card fit. On this auction it is likely we have a fit because if they have a fit. Mathematically most of the time that is true. Let me explain the math.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's say they have a 9 card fit. That means we only have 4 cards in their suit leaving us 22 cards in the other 3 suits. Therefore, we mathematically must have at least one 8 card fit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if they have an 8 card fit, we have 21 cards in the other 3 suits, meaning it is barely possible we have three 7-card fit though, the likelihood is we have at least one 8-card fit.|

mb|D|mb|P|mb|3C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is the correct bid. My competitive guidelines indicate why that is so. Although, West is not 100% sure, more often than not East will have 4 spades meaning a 9-card fit is likely. And you should bid 3 over 3 with a 9-card fit.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players are afraid that when partner opens 1@C they have only 3 clubs. Although that is possible, it turns out that only occurs about 15% of the time when you open 1@C.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you can make a conditional assumption that partner has 4+ clubs when they open 1@C. Having said that, although 2@C is likely to land NS in an 8+ card fit, North has at least 2 better alternative responses. My choice is 1@D. Another choice is 1N.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


mb|2D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 2@D is possible but a tad risky because of the vulnerability. Although ostensibly East has 12 HCP the @CK is a bit dubious since I opened 1@C meaning it is more likely I have the @CA.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly, now that East has bid 2@D, I upgrade my @DK because it is more likely East has the @DA and I have a clear 3@C bid, because I know we have a 9 card fit. Even without inverted raises I know partner has at least 4 clubs to bid 2@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand is a little weak to bid 1@S especially with a relatively weak suit and being vulnerable which is another reason to avoid making a marginal overcall.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, don't worry too much about being vulnerable when competing. However, when making a marginal call, you should just be a tad more cautious when vulnerable than not vulnerable.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss a couple of things about East's options ignoring the double by North. With only 2 spades, East should pass over the double and with 4 spades, East should make a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=superaccepts,Super Accept^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

You know you have a 9-card fit, so the Law of Total Tricks says it is safe for you to bid to the 3-level.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most players use simple |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=superaccepts,Super Accepts^*N|CP||FP||at|. If you play those, you jump to the 3 level in partner's suit to show 4-card support. Some play that, even with 4-card support, you do not jump to the 3 level unless you have more than a minimum 1NT opener (17 or a good 16). |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I always jump to the 3-level whenever I have 4-card support, regardless of the strength of my 1NT opener. But that is just a matter of style.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a more sophisticated way to play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=superaccepts,Super Accepts^*N|CP||FP||at|. And that is. rather than simply jumping to the 3 level in partner's suit, if you have 4-card support and a doubleton, you bid the suit in which you have a ^*Bdoubleton^*N. That gives responder more information about your hand and allows him to make a better decision as to whether or not to bid game. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 4-card support and no doubleton, you bid 2N with a maximum NT opener and jump to 3 of partner's suit with a minimum NT opener. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the way I play. But some play that you only bid your doubleton with a maximum 1NT opener, and that a jump to 3 of responder's suit shows a minimum NT opener regardless of whether or not opener has a doubleton.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand, playing sophisticated |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=superaccepts,Super Accepts^*N|CP||FP||at|, East bids 3@H to show 4 spades and a doubleton heart. Assuming South passes, if West is not interested in game, they bid 3@S. If West wants to play in 4@S, they can either bid 4@S, or bid 4@H as a "re-transfer" so that East can end up as declarer in 4@S. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, South happened to double 3@H, which gives West more options. West can now use a redouble as a re-transfer, forcing East to bid 3@S. West is strong enough to bid 4@S over 3@S, but with a weaker hand West would pass 3@S.|
