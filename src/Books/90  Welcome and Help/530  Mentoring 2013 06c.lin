^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A diamond is fine as an opening lead. But there are 2 problems with the earlier choice of the @D7. Normally you do not lead away from aces in a suit contract. So Ruth should lead the @DA should she choose to lead a diamond. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general the lead of an unprotected ace (ace without the king) should be avoided. On the other hand, leading an ace when it is partner's suit can be ok. Therefore, Ruth should lead the @DA. As you already know you can lead away from an ace in NT. If we were in NT contract, the correct lead from A J 10 is the Jack or the 10 if playing coded 10s.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was straight forward and no comments are needed. I have one other comment on the bidding. Some experts play the 3S bid is just competing. It is not a game try. To make a game try East would bid 3@H. In that auction it says nothing about hearts. It simply says East is inviting to 4@S. Therefore, if you play 3@S is just competing, then your only game try is 3@H which is completely artificial in that particular auction. It is a common treatment with experts.|

A kib: Could it be clubs as well as hearts - (unbid suit)?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an interesting hand for North to bid. South must have 3 cards in 1 major at least. Therefore, North knows for sure there is at least one 8-card fit. With 5/5 in majors responder should not bid Stayman. Because if notrumper did not have a 4-card major an bids 2@D, you will have to guess which suit to bid next.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The correct way to bid the hand with 5/5 in majors is first transfer to spades by bidding 2@H.|

mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With an invitational hand North would bid 3@H after my forced 2@S bid. After the 3@H bid again I have  several choices. I could pass 3@H, correct to 3@S with a minimum NT or I could bid 4@H or 4@S with a maximum NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner bids 2D, you jump in your 5-card major (I will get to Smolen in a minute). So with 5 spades and 4 hearts and a game force, for example you bid 3@S. For example:|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a convention known as Smolen, which I do not particularly recommend. If you play Smolen, then you would jump in your 4 card major. For example, 1N-2C-2D-3S, with Smolen, shows 5 hearts and 4 spades. The justification is that way, the NT bidder can bid 4H with 3 hearts and be declarer. The argument being it is better for the strong hand to be hidden. Having the strong hand as declarer is over rated. It often makes no difference.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think it is easy to forget Smolen and I recommend against playing it. But is is up to you. I will bet if you play Smolen you will have a bidding misunderstanding or two.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done Kim. Let's talk about the play first. Normally I recommend against leading a suit the opponents have bid. But with such nice diamonds, I would have made the same lead as east did.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After trick 1 Kim has 9 easy tricks. 4 clubs, 1 diamond (2 diamonds if first diamond is won at trick one in the North hand), 2 spades, and 2 hearts. So she did well to go after clubs first and then could knock out the @HK.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One point on the bidding. As many of you know I would open Ruth's hand 2@S. I do not subscribe to the theory that you should not have an outside 4-card major - many do.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, had she opened 2@S we probably still get to 3N. but Jacquie leads a spade and 3N goes down. I know many of you are worried about being vulnerable but it is very difficult for the opponents to double you. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, first of all a double is takeout which means the partner of the doubler has to pass the takeout double to convert it to penalty double. And if they do, they may be doubling you into game, which is risky.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, at trick 3 Jacquie should shift to a club particularly since Ruth bid the suit. Once the spade is played, Kim should make the hand. She should ruff the spade on the board, and throw a club from her hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the bidding first. 3C is ok, but here is a rule you might want to consider when preempting if partner is an un-passed hand, and you have a long suit headed by AKQ. That is very powerful, because it could easily be running with no losers. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you might just make a simple overcall when partner has not passed because you could easily miss game. However, had Ruth passed then 3C would be a good tactic.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth made a very nice 4@S bid. Even if Kim has nothing, she would have to be unlucky to lose more than 2 hearts and 1 club. Slam makes because of Kim's singleton heart. But it is extremely hard to bid it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth has two choices. She can cuebid spades showing a limit raise plus and 4+ card support or just bid 4@H. Just to remind you you cannot use Jacoby 2N after opponents interfere and Jordan 2N is after the opponents double the opening bid.|
