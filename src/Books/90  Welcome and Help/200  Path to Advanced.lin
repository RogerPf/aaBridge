pg| ***** 7 ***** |


n#|3|at|
Clearly the @s are ^*b 1363 ^*n.  (Try not to do arithmetic tell yourself the 'shape'.  Your unconscious competence, cannot do sums but loves patterns).  So partner has 3 trumps, the one bit of good news is that declarer does not yet know about the 3-3 split.|

n#|3|at|
The @hK is certainly a strange lead, given that you are holding the @hQ.  Leading a singleton king or even a doubleton king would be weird UNLESS partner has just the @hAK bare in the suit.
|n#|3|at|Either way we would signal encouragement,  (high - low).|

at|^^^c@2I know we cannot really stop time, but if we could stop and think you should be able to see that running the @s9 on to partners @sK was a very poor play.    We know that declarer started with 6@s and 4@h and has played 2@d.
|n#|3|at|So declarer started with  ^*b6421^*n (we can discount ^*b6430^*n as the club void would strand the club tricks).  
Declarer is therefore sitting there with 2@h losers (partner can ruff declarers @hJ) which could have been thrown on the @cAKQ.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|n^|5|
at|Note - we never ask the question  "What should I lead ?"
|n#|3|at|^c@2Our answers to the repeated question  ^*b What is going on ? ^*n makes our play almost obvious.  
|n#|3|at|We will cash our master heart the  @hQ  and lead the @h8 for partner to ruff and declarer will have to give you 
the @sQ unless we do something silly and try to ruff with the @s7.|

at|^^^c@2It is notable that East has a very reasonable 8 hcp.   The @sK can be expected to be well placed, but chose not to invite opposite partners 1N overcall range of  15 - 18.|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


n#|3|at|^^Now that we can see the 8 hcp in dummy we can re-calculate partner's hcp,   40 - 16 - 8 - 2   =   14 hcp
The lead of the @sQ tells us that the  @sJ  is with partner and the  @sA  is with West (declarer).|

pg| ***** 133 ***** |


n#|3|at|^^^c@2One good starting point is to take the suits in order. Starting with trumps or with the suit partner led.  Both are good approaches but in this case because of the Stayman bid it is natural to start with Hearts.  We already know West (declarer) has 4 @hs  this means that (starting with East and going clockwise) we know that the suit is  ^*b354? ^*n    So the  ?  for partner's heart length has to a singleton.    To put it another way,  the answer to|
n#|3|at|^^^fWhat is going on in @h's ?  is     ^*b 3541^*n|

pg| ***** 135 ***** |


n#|3|at|^c@2^^In spades we know it's (clockwise from East)  ^*b 43?? ^*n  We also  know that the question mark  for West is ^*b not ^*n 4, as West has denied having 4 spades and promised at least 2 (the NT bid)  so West has either 2 or 3 spades. This means the layout in spades is either ^*b 4324 ^*n  or  ^*b 4333^*n.    So partner has either 3 or 4 spades giving partner the possible hand shapes of  ^*b 41?? ^*n  or  ^*b 31?? ^*n   |

at|At first sight it might look as if this is where we have to stop.  We know that partner has either 8 or 9 cards in the minors @- the end.  But there is something we have missed.    Partner led the  5@c  AND  we can see ALL the @cs lower than the five.  |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


n#|3|at|^^This means that partner has almost certainly led the fourth highest from a 4 card suit.  And that means that she must also be holding ONLY 4 @ds.  (Why would partner lead against no-trumps from a 4 card suit if she has a 5 card suit ?).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|n^|5|

at|So partner started with 8 cards in the minors and so has to have 4 (not 3) spades.|
n#|3|at|^^So unusually we have first worked out partners shape as  ^*b 4144 ^*n  but doing so means that we will automatically now know declarer shape ^*b 2443^*n.|
