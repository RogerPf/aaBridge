^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lots to discuss here. First of all, Stan should strongly consider a negative double. That way he can discover a 9-card fit. Granted if Sandy passes, then Ann would bid 1S and they would find their fit. But these days, everyone likes to bid, so your actions need to take that into account. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2nd, although 2S worked out, I think Stan has a pass of 2C. His club void, combined with his diamond cards and Sandy's 1N bid, makes it likely this is a misfit. And when the hand is a misfit, you want to stay as low as possible. It turns out they have a spade fit, but once Stan does not negative double, it is hard to find.|

PG| ***** 21 ***** |

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A negative double only promises 4 card suits, it is true, but Stan is strong enough to venture 2H if Ann doesn't bid a major. In this fashion he can get both his majors across and show a 5-card heart suit at least.|

athni: Can Ann double over 1NT showing 4-card spades?|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people would play 1C-1D-1H-2D-x, for example, would show 4 spades and clubs,but a) over 1NT most would play double as penalty and 
b) normally Stan would negative double with hearts and spades, so playing double there as spades would not be likely to find a fit. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss whether or not Stan should open 1NT. You could make a case that with 4x3 distribution, and lots of quacks, it is not really worth 15 HCP. So 1C would be pessimistic but reasonable.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I find in general, you get more accurate bidding when you open 1N. Therefore, I tend to open 1N with just about any 15-17 balanced hand. If anything, I might stretch with a good 14 HCP hand and a quality 5-card minor. But I rarely down grade a hand with 15-17 balanced and not open 1N.|

fazzzoola: What about the fact that E/W are not vul and Stan is bidding 3rd after two passes?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Can you explain further why you think that is important fazzzoola. I am not sure why that might be relevant.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT|
fazzzoola: Sure. In 3rd position, after two passes and not vul, Stan can sure venture a bit with 1N.. IMO.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That certainly could work out. I tend to be pretty straight with my 1N openers, but others are a little more flexible.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |

AT|
TwstofLime:  And how to defeat the contract?|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is easy when you can see all 4 hands. It takes expert defense to defeat the contract as it is very difficult to see the line. At trick 7 Sandy could duck. Even after winning the trick leading back a @S8 did not help. A low heart away from Ace would be a better play. But that could work out badly. Further, I could go up with my @HQ when Stan leads a low heart off dummy but that is also hard to see.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The point is, in close contracts, it is easy to not defend perfectly, which is why you should be  aggressive because even contracts that should not make often do.|

princesess: What about lead spades at first?|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, good point nanda. I think a spade is a better lead by Sandy. I prefer 4th from longest and strongest, and spades are stronger than clubs.|

TwstofLime:  That was a daring 3@S opening. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, lets talk about that. First of all, I believe in "daring" pre-empts in general. If you have the right suit length, and  a weak hand, I think pre-empting regardless of suit strength is a great tactic.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
TwstofLime:  Because you are hoping partner has good pts?|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


AT|
irinica:   You had only one honor.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is hard for the opponents to double you, and you put a lot of pressure on them and they often make the wrong decision.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|
TwstofLime:  And you were in spades.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|let's talk about why suit length is more important for pre-empting than suit strength. If we play in spades, my hand is worth lots of tricks. If we play anywhere else, my hand is worthless. If I have a 7 card suit, that means there are 6 out between the other hands. That means, on average, pard will have 2, and we have a 9-card fit. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if you believe in the Law of Total Tricks (and I do), on average we are safe at the 3 level. That is why I value length over strength. But I certainly understand if you prefer to have a better suit, if that makes you more comfortable. That just means you won't preempt as often. I would argue that means you have less opportunity to get a good result by disrupting the opponents.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
princesess: What is when you are vulnerable to bid 3@S?|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Princesess brings up a valid point about vulnerability. On this hand, more experts (although far from all) are likely to pre-empt because of the "favorable" vulnerability. When you are not vulnerable and they are, pre-empts are the most effective because the reward for disrupting their game bidding far outweighs the risk of your going down too much. In other words, the risk/reward is highly in your favor at favorable vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if you are vulnerable, and especially if they are not, the risk/reward is not as high.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


AT| 
stanira3: Would you still preempt if vul vs. non-vul?|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would, but most experts, with the possible exception of Marty Bergen, would not. And some experts would open 2S vul with my hand.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT|^B@2
athni: Even if you don't have strength, length gives you around 10 pts and if partner has strong hand he can bid 4 of the suit even if 9-card fit am I right?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No Sandy, you don't have a good bid over 3S. You could double or you could bid 4D. But both are risky. 4D works out but if Stan had Ann's diamonds it would not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is very good point. With a 10-card fit, missing the K, you take the finesse. It is much more likely that the king is onside than that there is a singleton king offside. On the other hand, I slightly misplayed the suit. The best play is to lead the @SQ off dummy and play low if East does not play the @SK. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That way, if East happened to start with @sK10x and West was void, I can still pick up the suit for no losers. If that were the case, when I led the @SQ , if East plays low, I play low. East is left with SK10 and I still have SAJ and can finesse again. If East covers the @SQ with the @SK, once West shows out, I know East has @S107 left. Since I have @SJ9 left, I return to dummy and lead a low spade, finessing East for the @S10.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.
