^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A spade is fine. There is no harm in giving declarer a ruff that they are entitled to anyway. That is at worst a neutral play. All other plays by Liza had the potential to give up a trick. So remember, don't worry about giving declarer a ruff. But usually a ruff and sluff (e.g Liza leading a diamond) is not a good play, as that often does give up a trick.|pc|SJ|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a tough hand for Liza to bid. and we will also discuss the play. Unfortunately Liza has no good bid over 1@C, so she has to choose the least bad alternative. 1@D is certainly very reasonable. even though she only has a 4-card suit, it is a quality suit. And had Kia been paying attention he would have raised to 2@D :). |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically when you have to make an imperfect choice, you should make the choice that gives you the best opportunity to get a good score. Liza has 4 imperfect choices of pass, 1@D, 1@S, and 1N. I would not pass because the hand is too strong, and PASS is not likely to get you a good result.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S has some merit, but you  only have a 4 card suit. It does have 2 honors but it is, unlike 1D which is a very good suit, a little weak for a 4-card overcall. On the plus side, it allows you to compete more effectively since whichever side owns spades can compete at the same level as the opponents. The other alternative is 1NT. That would be my choice. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Liza had a doubleton heart she would have bid 1NT. 1NT gets the most information across. Nevertheless, it is far from obvious what to bid Liza and different experts would have different opinions. But I like 1NT as providing us with the best opportunity to get a good result, because other than the singleton heart, partner knows you have a balanced hand with a club stopper and what your range is. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But 1@D will get partner off to the best lead if you end up defending. After all said and done, I rank 1N the best, pass the worst, 1@D 2nd best, and 1@S 3rd best (1@D and 1N are close).|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. Ruth made one crucial error in the play, as I think she figured out. Normally, when taking a finesse it is better to lead low towards an honor than leading an honor out of your hand. So her instinct to lead a low heart would normally be right. The reason being, if you lead an honor out of your hand, and it gets covered, it takes 2 of your honors to knock out 1 of theirs. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this hand, Ruth has limited entries so she needs to lead the @HJ out of her hand so she can repeat the finesse if need be. If she does that, Ruth loses no hearts and makes the hand. As always, a little planning helps. Having said that, Ruth can still recover by playing the @CA and another club, and use a club ruff to get back to her hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of my favorite bids is 2@C over 1@D. It makes it that much harder for the opponents to find their major suit fit. I tend to be fairly aggressive in bidding 2@C over 1@D. But on this hand, I have a clear 2@C bid. Yes we might miss a spade fit, but there is no good way for us to find it unless I pass and pard bids spades or they bid diamonds and hearts and I make a takeout double later. But, I would rather "bid early bid often" so 2@C is clear to me.|mb|2C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jacquie missed a slightly better play, but was rather unlucky I had a singleton heart. She should lead a low heart to the @HK, draw my last trump and come back to her hand with the @HA to cash her diamonds.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next let me explain why Ruth's 3@C bid was fine. She knows we have an 8 card fit and "If we have a fit they have a fit." And if they have a fit you are supposed to bid 3 over 2 even with an 8 card fit. Therefore, 3@C was keeping with my competitive guidelines. In fact, Ruth knows for sure they have a spade fit, because I would overcall in spades with 5 spades, so I have at most 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually I didn't look closely but Kib makes a good point. With 13 dummy points in spades, (11 HCP, quality suit, doubleton) West should bid 4@S. On the other hand, with the bad split and diamond ace off side, 3@S worked out better, but they should be in 4@S actually.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a case where I should think about protecting in case partner has diamonds. Negative doubles are a great convention but you do give up the ability to make a penalty double. So whenever it goes 1x-overcall-p-p, and you are short in the overcalled suit, you need to consider the possibility that pard has length in the overcalled suit and would like to double for penalty. You should strain to make a reopening double. On this hand it turns out Liza does not have a diamond stack but she easily could.|mb|d|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice Ruth. Now Jacquie has a big problem. Misfit hands should be passed ASAP. However, it is possible they can make 4@S if Ruth has spade support. Jacquie has enough HCP for game, but a bad fit. On average, Ruth will have 2 spades because she has 6 cards outside of diamonds, so her average holding in any suit is 2. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I don't think you want to play in spades opposite a small doubleton. Pass is the best option. Most players would either bid 3@S or 3N with Jacquie's hand. But many experts would pass. After 4@D, the pass by Jacquie worked out ok, she just made Ruth work a little harder :).|

If you let the opponents bid unimpeded when they open 1N, they almost always will get to the right contract. So you need to get in their way when you can. Despite her lack of HCP, Ruth has 2 nice suits and unbalanced distribution (a singleton). Therefore, I think 2@H is a nice bid.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.

Now I must make a forcing bid here. I know we have at least game. It is possible we have slam, but not likely, as my spade points are not likely to fit well with Ruth. So my 2 best choices are 2@S (limit+ raise in clubs) or 3N. I will choose 3N, as that is most likely to be our best contract.
 
certagen: Why not lead spade, partner's suit?

It may be the best lead, but Liza does get demerits for not leading pard's suit
realrowdy (Liza):  :)
hondo717: ok, I can count 3 spades and 3 diamonds for sure plus 1 club
hondo717: thats 7, I can knock out the HA for 9
hondo717: so lets do that. we can then work on clubs for possibly more tricks
hondo717: at worst I will lose 2 club tricks and still make the contract
hondo717: thats it. I now have more tricks than I know what to do with
jacquiek (Jacquie): was my spade lead incorrect?
->jacquiek (Jacquie): no, it was fine
jacquiek (Jacquie): didn't want to lead into dummy's tenace
ruth_p (Ruth): wdp
hondo717: ty
hondo717: so here was a case where I bid what I thought I could make
hondo717: I believe in the "no accident" theory of bidding when it is appropriate
hondo717: that means make the clearest bid you  can if you are pretty sure it is the place where you want to end up
hondo717: and my judgement was 3N was very likely to be where we would end up, and 6C was fairly unlikely given the spade overcall
hondo717: as to the lead, a heart could be right, but I would have led a spade
hondo717: as I tell my partners "you never lose the postmortem if you lead my suit" (even if it turns out there is a better lead)
hondo717: if nothing else, it builds partnership trust
hondo717: good bid by Ruth
hondo717: just like you should alwasy open 1NT with a balanced 15-17 count, you should overcall 1NT with 15-18 and a stopper in opener's suit
hondo717: the 1N opener or overcall is very descriptive. and auctions that start with 1NT almost always result in your side reaching the best contract
hondo717: which, by the way, is why I like the weak NT. because the same could be said playing a weak NT
rjslkids1: DO u ever open l nt holding 5 sp. i keep getting different respnses to that 
->rjslkids1: always. there are some who think you should open 1S, but I very much disagree. what do you bid when partner responds 1N? do you pass? do you bid a 3 card minor? do you raise to 2N? ...
->rjslkids1: who knows?
realrowdy (Liza):  Is there a movie on weak NT?  I would like to learn it
hondo717: I do have a lesson series on the weak NT.
hondo717: on my web site.
ruth_p (Ruth): typ
realrowdy (Liza): Good I will look
hondo717: if Kia were here he could give you the link
realrowdy (Liza):  np  I know how to look
->azin: so how come you are incognito? :)
azin: http://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/#weaknt weak NT
hondo717: now why would you want to duck Ruth. you are in 2H, not 1N
hondo717: you have no spade losers
ruth_p (Ruth): you're right... once nt comes up, i get stuck on it...sp!!
hondo717: already gave you the undo
ruth_p (Ruth): i was going to play the ace
->realrowdy (Liza): yes, that is better technique
ruth_p (Ruth): let opps guess where king is???
rjslkids1: i open lnt as u said with 5 sp because if open sp wrong hand is playing nt instead of sp suit thx
hondo717: yes, that is better technique
realrowdy (Liza): I have no P that plays it  but never hurts to learn it
hondo717: in general, as defender you play the lower of equals to inform partner about your holding
hondo717: but as declarer you want to hide your high cards, so you do the opposite, play the highest of equals to hide your high cards
hondo717: by playing the ace neither defender is sure who has the K
hondo717: but if Ruth had played the K, then both defenders would know she had the ace
hondo717: so remember that it is good technique as declarer to play the highest of equals to hide your holding
jacquiek (Jacquie):  i should be giving count
hondo717: it is difficult, but neither Ruth nor Jacquie kept track of the club spots
hondo717: turns out the C7 was good, so Jacquie should have ruffed and once she did not Ruth should have pitched
hondo717: however I am not sure why Liza played the C10
hondo717: 2nd hand low :)
hondo717: ok, so as you see we ended up in our best spot due to the 1N overcall
rjslkids1: dorothy i am kibitzing also
realrowdy (Liza):  she played the 8 I think
hondo717: I think you covered the C9 with the 19
hondo717: 10
hondo717: which as I said was not correct (2nd hand low)
btour: west lead the 10 c
hondo717: if you had the C8 then covering would be fine
hondo717: oh yes, I see you led the C10
btour: and east ruffed when the 10 was covered by norths q
hondo717: ok
hondo717: you ended up giving partner a ruff
->btour: ty
btour: I had to replay the movied though :)
hondo717: ok Ruth and Liza please switch
rjslkids1: never overcalll a n t until u hear opp partner bid 
->btour: I was busy answering questions and commenting and missed the play
btour: but your right 7 c good and declarer could have pitched
hondo717: now for those who want to get real aggressive preempting
btour: I was really wondering why leaving so much trump out
hondo717: not vul against vul, with 5-10 and 5-4-3-1 distribution, you might consider opening a weak 2 in 1st or 3rd seat
lanex93->Club: Thanks
hondo717: but I will play it straight
hondo717: however, you should strain to preempt when not vul against vul opps, especially in the 2 best seats, 1st and 3rd
hondo717: because those are the conditions which most favor a successful preempt
rjslkids1->Club: brb
vaishali54: hi
->vaishali54: hi
hondo717: that is new minor forcing, asking Ruth if she has 3 spades or 4 hearts
hondo717: it says nothing about diamonds
hondo717: after the hand I will discuss new minor forcing, including several variations
hondo717: 3D is ok, but normally you would bid 2H with 4 hearts, 2S with 3 spades, or 2N
ruth_p (Ruth): ty
jacquiek (Jacquie):  glpg
ruth_p (Ruth): typ
hondo717: now if I believe that is 4th best, I know a lot about the heart suit
hondo717: I know Ruth has 2 hearts
hondo717: because my 5 hearts + pards 4 hearts plus dummy's 2 hearts = 11 hearts
hondo717: I also know that Ruth has at least 1 card higher than the 9
hondo717: because I am missing the HQJ10
hondo717: and with the HQJ10 Liza would have led the Q
masse24: ......or rebid 3NT with a max 14 (which she has...though off shape)? :)
->masse24: thats true too
hondo717: now an expert defender would figure out I had 5 hearts
hondo717: and therefore unblock the heart suit
realrowdy (Liza):  she had to play K anyway
hondo717: the reason Liza knows I have 5 hearts is Ruth would not play the HQ with Qx left, so she must have started with a doubleton
hondo717: thats true, but you block the heart suit.
hondo717: if you play low
hondo717: I am not saying you should figure that out, but an expert would figure that out
btour: qxx? not qx?
realrowdy (Liza):  get it
->btour: once Ruth plays the HQ, the heart suit is known to north
hondo717: ok before discussing new minor forcing, let me comment briefly on the play
hondo717: Ruth knows once she loses the lead, the defense will win 4 heart tricks
hondo717: so in order to make 3N she cant lose the lead before taking 9 tricks
hondo717: she can count 5 clubs, 1 heart and 2 spades for 8 sure tricks
hondo717: if we couldnt take 4 heart tricks, then obviously the best play for a 9th trick is to knock out the DA
jacquiek (Jacquie):  so sorry i was frozen and booted
hondo717: but if she does that, she will go down
->jacquiek (Jacquie): np
ruth_p (Ruth): wb p
hondo717: so her only hope is that the spade finesse works
hondo717: and since that is the case, she might as well keep all her spades and throw diamonds on clubs
hondo717: because if the spade finesse works and they are 3-3, she can take 5 spade tricks
hondo717: and if the spade finesee loses, it doesnt matter that she kept diamonds
hondo717: so on this hand Ruth should actually make 5N
hondo717: it does not matter much with IMP scoring (2 imps) but it matters a great deal in match point scoring
hondo717: ok, now lets discuss new minor forcing and its variants
hondo717: basic new minor forcing works as follows
hondo717: partner opens 1 of a minor, you respond 1 of a major and partner rebids 1N (or 2N)
hondo717: if you then bid the other minor
hondo717: (2D on this hand because Ruth opened 1C)
hondo717: that is completely artficial
hondo717: it asks the 1N bidder about their major suit holdings
hondo717: and says nothing about the minor
hondo717: the 1N bidder has 4 choices
hondo717: first choice is to show 3 card support to responder's major (if opener had 4-card support they would have raised immediately)
hondo717: so on this hand Ruth's first obligation is to show 3 spades (with 4 spades she would have bid 2S)
hondo717: her 2nd choice is to show 4 hearts. Jacquie could have a hand with 5 spades and 4 hearts
hondo717: her other 2 choices are to bid 2N with 12 or 13 or 3N with a good 13 or 14
hondo717: so on this hand I was actually mistaken
hondo717: Ruth should have bid 3N, not 2N because she has 1 good 14 with a very nice 5-card suit
hondo717: when you bid new minor forcing you must have an invitational hand
hondo717: ok, now the variations
hondo717: I prefer "checkback stayman" to new minor forcing, although most bbo players prefer new minor forcing
hondo717: "checkback stayman" is very similar to new minor forcing, except 2C is always the bid responder uses to ask the 1N bidder about their majors
hondo717: so if it goes 1C-P-1S-P-1N-P-2C
btour: I am sorry to interupt but why does west get to count the qx of hearts as 2 points?
hondo717: and you play checkback stayman, that is not a club preference
->btour: they dont, sorry, but they do get an extra point for the quality club suit
hondo717: it is asking the 1N bidder about their majors, the same as those who play new minor forcing
hondo717: but the advantage of checkback is that opener can bid 2D over 2C, allowing partner to place the final contract in 2H or 2S
hondo717: because checkback does not have to promise an invitational hand
hondo717: with an invtational hand, over the 2D response to 2C, the checkback bidder could bid 2N
hondo717: e.g if the auction goes 1C-P-1S-P-1N-P-2C-P-2D-P-2N, that shows an invite
jacquiek (Jacquie):  so does 2!ds show less than 3 of responders major and deny 4 of the other major?
dae: what does 2 D show?
hondo717: but if the auction goes 1C-P-1S-P-1N-P-2C-P-2D-P-2H, that is a desire to play in 2H or 2S
hondo717: yes just like with regular stayman, 2D denies any holding of interest in the majors
hondo717: so 2D denies 3 card support for responder's major and 4 cards in the other major
dae: will this be printed somewhere, where we can copy it off?
masse24: Why do you prefer to prioritize showing 3 card support for Responder's Major rather than say...in this auction, 2!H if Opener had Four !H's? Or....just a style thing?
hondo717: I am not suggesting you play checkback, but I personally think it is better than new minor forcing
loubel: ok.............but lonely.......
->masse24: you could play you always bid hearts
realrowdy (Liza):  what if the minor opened is D?
dae: I have ALWAYS  never known the difference-GREAT   explanation
masse24: ok - thx. I do
hondo717: if it goes 1D-P-1S-P-1N-P-2C, that is still checkback
hondo717: an identical auction to new minor forcing
realrowdy (Liza):  tks
hondo717: but most people who play checkback do not have 2D available to show no interest in the majors
jacquiek (Jacquie):  in that case then opener must have long !ds.
hondo717: not necessarily, they have 4
hondo717: but they could be 4-4 in the minors
hondo717: ok, let me discuss another variation
jacquiek (Jacquie):  3-2-4-4...right
hondo717: and that is 2 way new minor forcing (or 2 way checkback)
dae: they the same?
hondo717: if you play that, then regardless of what minor is opened, 2C and 2D over 1N are both artficial bids
ed5: i am under the impression that MBC's version of nmf solves the situation whose existence makes u prefer chbk.  But I may be misunderstanding u.  
->dae: pretty much
dae: TY!!
->ed5: dont know what it is
hondo717: the difference is, if you bid 2C, that shows less than a game force
dae: hope I can remember it all
hondo717: if you bid 2D that is a game force
hondo717: so the auction 1D-P-1S-P-1N-P-2D is a game force
hondo717: 2D is artificial
hondo717: it just establishes a game force
hondo717: the 1N bidder should still describe their major suit holding if they have one
hondo717: of interest (e.g if they have 3 card support or 4 of the other major)
hondo717: but can also make other bids to better describe their hand
hondo717: so for example if Ruth and Jacquie were playing 2 way new minor forcing
hondo717: a reasonable auction would be 1C-P-1S-P-1N-P-2D-P-3C or 3D
hondo717: Ruth can then describe her hand better, showing either 5 clubs or 4 diamonds
hondo717: in case that is of interest to jacquie
aspiring (Lobby): hi howard!H!H
hondo717: so once you get down standard new minor forcing (or checkback) you might want to read about 2 way new minor forcing
->aspiring: hi des :)
boater: ty- g nite
hondo717: ok, now I am captain of the hand
alexkam30: jeez Howard - this is f'g advanced stuff - why you spent so much energy on this?
athni: in that case there should be agreement not to play nmf?
->alexkam30: because even though they dont play it, they find it interesting
dae: why?       has she limited her hand?
hondo717: I know we have game, and I am responsible for making sure we get there
->dae: I am captain because responder is almost always captain
hondo717: this auction will obviously be easy
dae: unless the responder bids NT  as a limit?
dae: to limit hand?
->dae: it doesnt matter. responder is almost always captain. read my fundamentals of constructive bidding part 1
hondo717: since Liza only bid 2S, limiting her hand to 15 or so, i know we dont have slam
hondo717: this hand is a little tricky, even with the favorable heart lead
vaishali54: ya 
hondo717: I have 2 potential spade losers, and a club loser
hondo717: if I lose 2 spades and 1 club, I can only count 3 spade tricks (2 on length + 1 ruff) 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 2 clubs
hondo717: thats only 9 tricks
hondo717: so I either have to get an extra ruff, or hope clubs are 3-3
hondo717: but lets start with spades
sshmj: can you consider ruff !D twice so that you can guarantee the contract?
->sshmj: doesnt guarantee
->sshmj: but yes
hondo717: now I am all set an can try for an over trick, but either ruffing 2 diamonds, or trying for an extra club or 2
hondo717: since I have 2 chances in clubs (CQ onside or 3-3 clubs) that is what I will try
sshmj: kind of dummy reversal, by ruffing !D twice, you might discard 2 !C on dummy's 2 !S
->sshmj: very reasonable way to play the hand
->sshmj: I mean your suggestion is very reasonable
sshmj: of course need to ruff 4th !D high
realrowdy (Liza):  very good....wish I could figure it out that quickly
->sshmj: yes, this way was easier to see is why I didi it
hondo717: its sometimes hard, but you should get in the habit of counting your winners on every hand you play
hondo717: this hand was a little harder to count than average
hondo717: but that doesnt mean you shouldnt try :)
hondo717: ok Liza and Jacquie switch
shoemad: how did u know that u had to start with the dummy spades instead of your hand?
hondo717: let me make my announcements now, since Kia is not here
->shoemad: because I was hoping east had the SQ and therefore I would only lose 1 spade, not 2
ed5: whom. ty.
shoemad: ik ty
shoemad: ok
hondo717: regular session next week here in the BILlies Retreat at 10 PM Thursday
hondo717: I have 2 more weeks of Defense 202, and I will then resume my regular schedule of wed and thu sessions
hondo717: in honor of the BIL 10th anniversary session, I am giving a special lesson
hondo717: on Saturday 9/21 (9 days from now) at 11 AM
hondo717: it is one of my favorite lessons, Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding Part 1
hondo717: in which I talk about the general principles of bidding, regardless of system
hondo717: who is in charge of the auction, how you establish game forces, and so forth
hondo717: if you understand the basic concepts, it makes it much easier to play any system you choose
hondo717: so I hope some of you will be able to attend the lesson
hondo717: ok next hand
DougC43: 11 AM Eastern time?
->DougC43: yes
athni: where is the lesson?
hondo717: here
athni: ok ty
hondo717: we are playing 2/1, right jacquie?
jacquiek (Jacquie):  yes
alexkam30: good hand for serious 3nt... 1s-2d-2s-3s-3nt!
hondo717: note that I cant bid 2H, because that promises a 5-card suit
jacquiek (Jacquie):  i think I am showing extras
hondo717: ok, lets talk about what the 3S bid means in 2/1
hondo717: it has a very special meaning
hondo717: it is not the same as in sayc where it would be 16-18 with a nice 6-card suit
hondo717: the idea behind 2/1 is to conserve bidding space when exploring for slam
msphola: a solid suit?
hondo717: so if you make a bid that takes up a lot of space, such as 3S, you better have a good reason
hondo717: so experts play that the 3S bid conveys the following message:
hondo717: "partner, I have a self sufficient suit. spades are trumps, even if you have a void"
hondo717: if you have any interest in slam, start control bidding
hondo717: it does not necessarily show 16 points per se, although when you have good spades your hand usually counts to at least that
ed5: 16+
hondo717: Jacquie is close to a 3S bid
hondo717: with AKQ10xx it would be 100% clear
jacquiek (Jacquie):  i thought so too, but an "advanced" player told me to jump to show pts....I didn't agree, but I"m not advanced.
jacquiek (Jacquie):  I'm glad this came up again tonight.
hondo717: Since voids are so rare, you can assume pard has a singleton, so even with AKJ10xx that is pretty close to a self sufficient suit
hondo717: so we can let it stand
hondo717: now I am very interested in slam. in fact the only question is 6 or 7
hondo717: so I will start to control bid
jacquiek (Jacquie):  italian
jacquiek (Jacquie):  ?
hondo717: yes
msphola: If the auction went 2!S instead of 3, how would you bid slam?
hondo717: control bids show first or 2nd round control in the suit bid (A, K, singleton or void)
->msphola: I would bid 3S and we would stlil control bid
msphola: ok
hondo717: in partner's suit you never show shortness, so I happen to know that Jacquie is showing the DK
sshmj: why did you start control bidding? You had all side suits controlled well and p bid 3s
hondo717: this is subtle, but an expert would play 4H shows an interest in 7 because if I had a heart control and was only interested in 6
hondo717: I dont need to bid 4H since I know we have controls in all 3 suits
hondo717: I assume 1430
jacquiek (Jacquie):  ok
hondo717: we can do 0314, I actually prefer that ,but it is not what most play
hondo717: ok that is the Q ask by jacqui
BrianRC: why do you prefer 0314 Howard?
alexkam30: 5nt-7S
hondo717: because it is more logical, 5C is a lower bid and should show fewer key cards
hondo717: the reason for 1430 is very obscure and very arcane
hondo717: and not applicable to most auctions
hondo717: I am not sure why it was foisted upon the bridge public
hondo717: ok, back to 5H
hondo717: if I don't have the SQ I bid 5S
hondo717: if I do have the SQ (like on this hand) I bid something else
hondo717: my first choice is to bid a suit in which I have an outside king
hondo717: if I dont have that, then there are 2 styles
hondo717: my choice is that I bid 5N to show the SQ but no outside K
hondo717: but some people play that a jump to 6S shows the SQ and no outside K
hondo717: the reason I like 5N better is it gives more options to the 4N bidder (perhaps they want to choose a different suit on some hands)
athni: dblton cl can be a control?
->athni: singleton club is a 2nd round control
jacquiek (Jacquie):  ???
hondo717: good job Jacquie :)
hondo717: if you only bid 6 then I was going to ask why you bothered with the Q ask
jacquiek (Jacquie):  yeah
athni: but here u hv dblton club
jacquiek (Jacquie):  i count 12 without seeing anything
alexkam30: some student just suggested 6H bid by north to ask for help...
->alexkam30: only if you have that agreement. I would say 6D is a better agreement, to show the DQ
sshmj: 7n can make too
->sshmj: who cares
sshmj: cares in mp
->sshmj: you will get close to a top board just for bidding 7
alexkam30: can north bid grand had she had dbleton C?
sshmj: if every table bids 7, the 10 points will make difference
masse24: 6!H might have been a cute asking bid along the way to the Grand...
->sshmj: I guarantee you very few tables will bid 7, some wont even bid 6 believe it or not
hondo717: very nice Jacquie :)
realrowdy (Liza):  Looked so easy J  :)
hondo717: I will go on to the next hand and let Jacquie rest on her laurels :)
jacquiek (Jacquie):  ty Howard
jacquiek (Jacquie):  lol:)
DougC43: i guess it could be 7nt at matchpoints?
->DougC43: will make very little difference. bidding 7 will get you most of the match points
->DougC43: bidding NT slams vs suits slams are not where the match points are. It is bidding making slams that get you the points
->DougC43: I know a lot of players worry about NT vs suits. but it is highly overrated to worry about it
hondo717: what do you think 2C means liza?
dae: real club suit, ,right>?
->DougC43: obviously 3N vs 5 of a minor is important, but 3N vs 4 of a major is not usually
alexkam30: disagree with you on 0314, but what else new? :)
realrowdy (Liza):  I have nothing else to bis  so guess I dont know
hondo717: it is a cue bid
realrowdy (Liza):  michaels?
hondo717: if you were a passed hand, it would establish a game force
hondo717: saying you have opening points
realrowdy (Liza):  ok
hondo717: since you are a passed hand, it says you have close to an opener and want Ruth to pick her best suit
realrowdy (Liza):  good to know
hondo717: ok, but you do have a better bid here
hondo717: and that is 1N
msphola: 1n
hondo717: that shows 7-10 or so and clubs
->msphola: :)
->msphola: very good
msphola: ty
ruth_p (Ruth): i can't pass???
hondo717: sure you can
hondo717: its not forcing
hondo717: it shows 7-10 denies a major and shows a club stopper
ruth_p (Ruth): ty
hondo717: so why not pass
ruth_p (Ruth): glp
Noah121: Is a cuebid the only forcing advance of a takeout double?
->Noah121: yes, although a jump is highly invitational
ruth_p (Ruth): vglp!!!
realrowdy (Liza):  Thanks P  I was afraid of this:)
hondo717: hear Jacquie should give count, which she did
jacquiek (Jacquie):  i know....i messed that up....but didn't ask for undo:(
hondo717: you didnt mess it up, you gave count :)
hondo717: even if it was unintentional, dont admit it :)
jacquiek (Jacquie):  i knew I was supposed to but didn't remember (resting on my Laurels);)
sshmj: no, he should've tried s suit
sshmj: it was you who had !DA
->sshmj: you are correct
Athena3: !hgm
ruth_p (Ruth): nice try Lisa!!!
->Athena3: rena! how nice to see you
Athena3: :)
realrowdy (Liza):  tks   can I make Howard
jacquiek (Jacquie):  good try Liza
hondo717: ok this was a tough hand, but makeable
hondo717: again, you should start by counting your tricks
realrowdy (Liza):  I had 6
hondo717: 1 spade and 2 hearts for sure
hondo717: 2 clubs, once the CA is out
hondo717: and 1 diamond once the DA is out
hondo717: as Liza said that comes to 6
hondo717: so the best chance for a 7th is to play for a 3-3 break in either diamonds or spades
btour: sorry I missed where the count signal was pls
hondo717: since you have to knock out the DA anyway, I would try diamonds
->btour: on the CJ north gives count since she cant beat the jack, so obviously she has nothing in the suit
hondo717: so at trick 2 play a diamond
sshmj: he should've tried !D immediately at Trick 2
hondo717: and hope for 3-3 diamonds
hondo717: it turns out both suits break 3-3 so either works
hondo717: ok ty all for coming
kadu:  thx Howard great lesson
btour: ty
sshmj: since he played !C at trick 2, you had the chance to defeat it by switching to Hearts
hondo717: see you next thursday and possibly next saturday
msphola:  ty Howard.  Great lesson
kw2012:  Txs Howard, great lesson!
ruth_p (Ruth): thanks Howard!

->sshmj: a club seems much more obvious
