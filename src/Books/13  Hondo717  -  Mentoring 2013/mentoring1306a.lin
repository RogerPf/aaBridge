^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. Stan is a little off shape to  bid 1N, but too weak to bid 2@H which would be a reverse and show 16+. He could bid 2@D, but generally you should only do that with a 6-card suit or a nice 5 card suit. His diamonds are borderline "nice" but I like 1N better.|

stanira3: Is this the kind of hand Bergen suggests opening a 4-card major?|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No Bergen would open 1@D with your hand. I think it will work out best if you never open a 4-card major.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the lead. A club is very reasonable. Normally Sandy would lead top of nothing. However it turns out the 10 is sort of a tricky card. It is not exactly "something" but it is not exactly "nothing." Often, as on this hand, it can be important.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had Sandy led the @C10 then Stan knows he can overtake the @CQ and cash 4 club tricks. Although that happens to work on this hand, Stan has no way of knowing it.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, when you have 10xx and would normally lead top of nothing this is the one case where I recommend leading the second highest and preserve the 10.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know I say you should never lead the opponent's suit and that is a very good rule. I suggest you always follow it. But some experts might choose to lead a diamond from Sandy's hand. Let me explain why. There is some chance Stan only has 3 diamonds (although usually he will have at least 4). |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If he only has 4, and Ann has some diamond honor then when Ann gets in and leads diamonds, all Stan's finesses are losing. With such nice intermediate diamonds, and a reasonable chance Stan has 3 or 4, some experts might choose a diamond. But I would have led a heart or a club just like Sandy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of small comments. The few times you are fortunate to be dealt a 4 card honor sequence, like Sandy had, lead it. Top of a 3 or 4 card honor sequence is probably the strongest opening lead you can make.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second, at first trick, although Stan knows I have the SK (because the @SQ denies the SK) he should still definitely take the @SA. It is possible Sandy has 5 spades, in which case my @SK is singleton. There is no harm in taking the @SA and returning a spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best possible heart suit Ann can have is AQxxx. She probably has the @HA because otherwise Sandy would have played it on my @HK. But if Sandy has the @HQ I am setting up 2 heart tricks for Sandy (although it will be hard for her to get to dummy). Our heart tricks are not going anywhere.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Notice my carding here is extremely informative. You play the lowest of touching cards as 3rd hand. So when I play the @S10, if Sandy takes her @SA Ann knows for sure I have the @SQJ. If I incorrectly played my @SQ, Ann would have no idea who has the @SJ and @S10. That is why correct defensive carding is very important.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure what Stan should bid. 2D or pass are possible. With defense in the majors, I probably pass. But it is far from clear. Now, should Ann go on? If Stan had passed, definitely not. However, Ann does have 2 good reasons to possibly bid on:|

a) singleton spade - shortness in the opponents' suit is a huge asset
b) she is not vul and we are.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given Stan's double, it is unlikely we can make 4@S. So, most likely, 4C will not push us into a makeable game. Therefore, I would bid 4C with Ann's hand On the other hand, it is very possible we are down in 3S and you are down in 4C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Several points here. first nice going Sandy! Let's start with 2@C by Ann. She is not nearly strong enough to bid 2C. Bidding Stayman guarantees at least an invitational hand. Let's see why. Suppose (on a different hand) the auction went 1N-2C-2S-2N-?. The 1N opener is supposed to bid 3N with a non-min 1N opener. But Ann only has 6 points. So there is no way their side has the 25 HCP needed to make 3N even if pard has 17. |
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most they have is 23 and could have as few as 21. Therefore, don't bid Stayman with less than a good 8 points.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next let us look at Sandy's 2 spades bid. Normally that should show a 6-card suit. But with a very nice 5-card suit (even plays opposite a singleton) and being not vulnerable, 2@S is a nice aggressive bid. It also has the advantage of being lead directing.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense with Stan's hand I would choose 1 of 2 leads. Either the @SA or the @HA. The @SA has the advantage of removing dummy's trumps in case dummy can ruff something. Since Ann bid 2@C, Stan knows Ann has hearts, so the @HA probably does not cost a trick. |
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would lead the @SA with Stan's hand, and then switch to hearts. Then after cashing the 3rd heart, Ann should switch to a diamond. In that case Sandy loses 3 hearts, 2 spades, 2 diamonds, and maybe even a club for down 2 or 3 probably.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
