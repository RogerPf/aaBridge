^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, the bidding. Had East chosen to pass 1@H which is probably what I would have done, although 2C is ok, then I would bid 1N. You might think that the auction 1D-1H-P-P-1N says opener has 12-14. Many players do. But that is not correct. Partner passed, so is likely to have very little. Therefore, bidding 1N with 12-14 is incorrect and very dangerous. Freely bidding 1N after a passing partner shows a very strong hand, 18+.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had 15-17 I would have opened 1N. Therefore, 1N in 1D-1H-P-P-1N must show even a stronger hand. If you rebid 1N after partner has passed, you must have 18+.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. East made a nice play at trick 1. Sandy should have a doubleton when she leads the 8. When you lead partner's suit and have not supported it, you lead ^*Bcount^*N. With @C8xx Sandy should lead low. Therefore, Sandy should have a doubleton (or possibly a singleton). This is a good illustration of why you must lead ^*Bcount^*N when you have not supported partner.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, East can figure out I have @CK9 in my hand, and wants to save the @CA to capture an honor.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick 6, after drawing trump and throwing East in, East made a slight error. She led a low @S4. @S10 is better because a low spade confused Sandy who won the trick and played @SK. Had East led the 10, then Sandy would know that I have the @SQJ. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But since East led low, Sandy assumed East had an honor, and decided to cash the @SAK rather than leading away from her @HK. That gave me my 8th trick. The moral of this hand is, it is easy to misdefend, even experts do it a lot. So sometimes, in what appears to be a hopeless contract, throw in the defense and hope they give you a trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just as last hand, Ann should lead high so I don't think she has an honor.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding. Just because you have a 7-card suit, it does not mean you have to open 3. Stan's hand is too strong to open 3C. They may miss game and it misleads partner.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, Stan has a case for opening 3@C as it is likely the opponents have a major suit fit. So 3@C makes it hard for 4th seat to bid, and your side will not miss game. On the other hand, in 1st and 2nd seat, if your hand meets the rule of 20, open 1 of a suit. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan was also a bit lucky. If I were his partner, I would bid either 4@C or 5@C, using the LOTT. Opposite a pre-empt, from Sandy's perspective, it is unlikely your side has much defense. LOTT always applies when your partner pre-empts. And E/W is at favorable vul (E/W not vul, N/S vul).|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out if we get to 4@S, we are down 1 but, because Stan is so strong, Sandy's pass worked well, because even if he bid 4@C, they play it there. It is good to remember, when partner preempts, use the LOTT to decide how high to bid. Trump length is key. Don't worry about lack of HCP.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good Stan. Stan's play is known as the law of restricted choice. If you are missing the Queen and the Jack and one of the opponents drops an honor on the first trick, as I did. It is far more likely that honor was a singleton, than doubleton QJ. So you should finesse the other opponent for the J. The odds are 2-1 in your favor.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We talked about Stan's nice club play. A word about the bidding. Remember the negative double showing exactly 4@S, and a 1@S bid showing 5+, after a 1@H overcall.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next let's talk about what Sandy might do. Over 1@H, she might bid 2@D more as lead directing. That would be forcing were she not a passed hand. But since she was a passed hand, and she has such nice diamonds, 2@D could work well. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anytime you can help pard with an opening lead, you should do so. She could also bid 2@D after 1N, but, the "bid early bid often" principle says it is even better to do it over West's double or 1@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding is the most important issue to discuss. If opener jump shifts as Stan did that establishes a game force. Once he does, Ann is obligated to bid until they get to game. Ann cannot pass even with a very weak hand, say 5 HCP. That is very important. I will discuss shortly whether or not Stan should jump shift.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another important principle is it is rarely right to be in 5 of a minor rather than 3N. So if I were Ann I would have bid 3N. She could bid 3@D asking Stan to bid 3N with a heart stopper. But I would bid 3N outright. It certainly is possible we have 5 hearts off the top. Why help the defense find the best lead?|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The important concern is should Stan bid 3C? He needs 19 or 20 starting points to do so, since Ann is promising at least 6. He has 17 HCP, 1 quality suits, 1 length point, and 1 for Aces+Tens over quacks for 20 Starting Points. It is enough to game force. However, he could bid 3N instead of 3@C. In either case, they should get to 3N rather than 5@C. But it is tough to make 3N if I lead a heart. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|B) If that does not work she can hope I have the @SA and play a spade to @SK. But she needs to play the diamond first because as you saw, if Stan has the SA, she no longer has the timing to throw off her club assuming it is defended correctly.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
