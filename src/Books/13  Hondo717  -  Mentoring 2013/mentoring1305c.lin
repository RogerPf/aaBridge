^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people always bypass diamonds to bid a major. If you play that, which is known as "Walsh" then a 1D bid by me over 1C would deny a 4-card major. However, although I will bypass diamonds sometimes, I do not do it unconditionally. If I have a weak hand I often do it, because I want to make sure I get my major in (esp hearts) before there is interference. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with a stronger hand I will bid diamonds if I have a good suit. The reason it is especially important to bid hearts right away is, if I bid 1D and Sandy overcalled 1S (not on this hand) we could miss our heart fit.|mb|1H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan's 2@H promises no more than 15 or a bad 16. Therefore, it is theoretically possible we have game. However, I have 3 flaws, which tend to make me downgrade and not bid game.|

A club not good either but club happens to work on this hand, but you will not do well leading the opponents' suit. I would have led the @DA, which is not much better. @SK might have worked. But let me explain why there are 2 reasons that argue against it;|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading an unprotected King:
^cIs very risky in general, and often gives away a trick unless of course pard bid the  suit.
^c@2Second, in this case, with natural trump tricks, Sandy is not really looking for ruffs. Her ruffing a spade just made it easier for me to draw trump.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, when you have natural trump tricks on defense, you should not look for ruffs. Sandy has Q10xx of trumps. she should assume she will take 1 or 2 heart tricks, especially since the heart strength is more likely to be with me. As it turns out Stan has the heart strength, but that is not what rates to happen. And even so, Sandy still will take 2 heart tricks probably.|

A Kib: Probably double by Ann is a great bid but could she also consider 2@H - Michaels cuebid?|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. Actually, I think 2@H is more descriptive and 1@S is even better than double. You want to get across your suit length especially the spades. Double tends to show 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


sk|S|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for South.^^4h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me again count my Dummy Points. If you get in the habit of re-evaluating your hand, once there is a fit, and count your points, it really helps. I have 17 HCP + 1 length, 1 quality suit -1 for dubious @SJx = 18 Starting Points. Then I have 20 Dummy Points after adding 2 for 2 doubletons as dummy which is enough to bid game. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should consider returning a spade. Ann does not have 6 spades, otherwise she would have bid them. So Stan has to have at least one more. And based on the auction, where a double usually shows 4 spades, he could easily have 2 spades.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you have long trumps, making declarer ruff is often a good tactic. With 4 clubs, Sandy knows it will take at least 1 ruff to set up clubs. So shortening dummy's trump when she has 4 means 1 less entry.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the critique of the bidding. I would not dream of doubling with Sandy's hand. However, her brilliant defense justified her non-classical double. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 2@S bid Stan has a problem. If we reverse his spades and clubs then double would be right. But double promises support for the unbid suits. Singleton @C10 does not qualify as club support unless he has a huge hand and would correct and bid his sit. So he needs to just pass.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then after it goes 4S-P-P-? if Stan wishes he could bid 4N. That shows a 2 suited hand (any  2 suits). It is supposed to be 5-5, so I would not even bid 4N with his hand. But @HAKQx is a very good 4 card suit and can be counted as 5 heart cards. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case Ann would bid 5@C and Stan corrects to 5@D. Note that unlike the "unusual 2N" the "unusual 4N" over 4S shows any 2 suits, not just the 2 lowest because there is no room to show a 2 suiter with hearts. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S, another possible choice, by Stan is Michaels, but it show a very good hand, since it is forcing to the 4 level. You just have to  have good distribution. If it goes 2S-P-4S-P-P. Stan knows that Ann probably has a spade void since we have a 10 card fit and he is short in clubs. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Ann has as little as @DAKxx, they could easily be making 5D, maybe 6. Therefore, he can "picture" that 5 of a red suit is a good contract, based on his distribution more than simply his high cards.|

PG| ***** 89 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have to take into account he can have any 2 suits Ann. So if you bid 5@D, you must be able to tolerate hearts and you never bid 5@H unless you have a self sufficient suit. Therefore, you bid 5@C most often.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the auction. Everything is fine through 2@S. Stan has a nice hand, so he does have a problem. He has 4 reasonable choices - pass, 3@C, double, and 3@H. Let me discuss why 3@H is probably the lowest priority. Ann did not make a negative double so she either does not have 4 hearts, or if she does have hearts, she has a weak hand. Therefore, a heart fit is unlikely.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is probably wrong, because letting the opponents' play at the 2 level with an 8+ card fit is rarely winning bridge. That leaves double and 3@C which is my choice. With such wonderful spots, 3@C plays ok even if Ann has a singleton.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although the diamond play worked, that is the wrong way to play the suit especially missing the @D109. The proper play, with 9 diamonds, is just play the @DAK first. You will lose no diamonds on any 2-2 break or if the @DQ is singleton. That play will never gain you a trick and will often lose a trick unnecessarily.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
