^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That bid is incorrect. 2NT denies 4 card heart support.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid. ^^4H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Depending on the strength of your hand, you have 3 choices to directly raise hearts:
^c2@H rebid shows 4 hearts with a min opener (12-14 or so)
^c3@H rebid shows 4 hearts with a medium opener (15-17 or so)
^C4@H when you have enough to force to game opposite the 6 points I promised.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is NOT forcing. I can pass with 6-8. Once I bid 1H, Stan knows we have enough for game with his 19 points. So it is his responsibility to make sure we get to 4H. Most of the time with 19+ he will just bid 4H. On a few hands with shortness, he can splinter (e.g. 4D with a singleton diamond - not with this hand) on the way to 4H.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


ub||NT||mb|4H|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another popular misconception I need to clear up is, 4H is not a "shutout" bid. In fact, as I already stated, it shows a very strong hand. Opener can and should go on if he thinks slam is possible. We need 33 to make slam. Stan is showing around 19 or 20 dummy points.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||mb|p|sk|S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see how many declarer points I have - 11 HCP, -1 for dubious @DJx, 1 for 5 clubs, 1 for quality clubs. That gives me 12 Starting Points. Once we find a fit, I have some declarer add ons. I get 1 point for the 2 doubletons and 1 point for the 4+ card side club suit. That gets me up to 14 declarer points - 14 + 19/20 = 33/34. So small slam is possible.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In an ideal world, I would like to control bid to make sure we do not have 2 quick losers in either diamonds or spades, but we are already too high to begin control bidding.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the best I can do is bid RKCB to make sure we have enough key cards to bid slam. Once you bid RKCB, you have decided you have enough points to be in slam, and all you are doing is ensuring that you have enough key cards. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, based on partner's response, you should bid 6 if a) your side has all 5 key cards or b) your side has 4 key cards and the trump Queen. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I have 1 key card, that means I will bid slam if a) Stan has 4 key cards or b) Stan has 3 key cards and the @HQ.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there is a problem. Assume I bid 4NT. If Stan has 4 key cards, all is well, because he will respond 5C and I will bid 6H. But if Stan only has 3 key cards, I need to find out if he has the @HQ. So let us do exactly that and see what we run into.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


mb|4np|sk|n|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid. You are playing RKCB 1430^^5d|mb|5d|an|3 Key Cards|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


mb|P|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see, after he bids 5@D to show 3 key card (Although 5D theoretically shows 0 or 3 key cards, since Stan showed a 19+ point hand, he cannot have 0 key cards.), I will not be able to determine whether or not he has the @HQ. Because, if I bid 5@H over 5@D - for Queen ask, that is to play. Thus, I have to guess whether or not to bid 6@H as I have no way of asking Stan if he has the @HQ. And that could be disastrous.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The solution to this problem is to play a version of RKCB known as Kickback.|UB|4|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at| If you play that, then 4@S is asking for key cards - as RKCB - when hearts are trump. Let us try it.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


MB|4S|an|Kickback Blackwood|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||mb|p|sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When we use Kickback here the responses are:
^c4N = 1 or 4
^C5@C = 0 or 3|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

So Stan's bid now Stan is 5@C (0 or 3).|mb|5Cp|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I can bid 5@D to ask for @HQ.|mb|5D|an|Queen ask|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|p|at| If Stan had the @HQ, his first choice would be to show his cheapest side suit with a King. With the @HQ - not this hand - , Stan would have bid 5@S (shows @SK).|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT| But on this hand without the @HQ, Stan bids 5@H.|MB|5hp|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I know I am missing 1 key card and the @HQ, so I stop in 5.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Ann. Let us review Bergen Declarer Points. Ann has 10 HCP, 1 length point, and 1 quality suit point for 12 starting points. Once spades are raised, she can add 2 for the singleton plus 1 for the side 4-card heart suit which gives her 3 declarer addons, for a total of 15. I suggest you go to my web site and review the movies on Bergen Hand Evaluation at |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/0y4nvw^*N|CP||AT|. It is one of the best tools there is to help you bid accurately.|

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
