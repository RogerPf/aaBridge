^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the bidding. First of all, particularly since it went P-P-weak 2. Sandy's hand is so good the only question is which major game to play in. Her best bid is 3D - Michaels intending to raise whichever suit Stan bids to 4. Sandy got a bit lucky here.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann violated the LOTT by bidding 3D. Had she passed, then Stan would have passed and they end up in 2S.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Michaels is a) both majors over a minor or b) the other major and an unspecified minor over a major. So 2D-3D Michaels is both majors. 1H-2H Michaels is spades and an unknown minor. Some experts play 2H-3H a different way, but every expert plays 2D-3D as Michaels.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1H-2H is spades and either diamonds or clubs. I suggest you play 2H-3H as Michaels as well just to keep things consistent. However, FYI, some experts play that asks partner to bid 3N with a heart stopper. The type of hand where you would do that is if it goes 2H or 2S and you have a hand with a long running minor where you can see 9 tricks if pard has a stopper. However, as I said, to keep it simple, since the expert use rarely comes up, I suggest you play it as Michaels.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would open Stan's hand, although if you use Bergen "adjusted HCP" it is only worth 11 HCP (12 HCP - 1 for lots off quacks) which means it does not meet the rule of 20. But with 4-4 in the majors and a singleton, I would open anyway.  It is close enough.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sandy should make the hand. I was going to give her an undo, but decided perhaps it would be more useful if I explained after. Win the heart ace and cash the @CK before leading to the @SQ. Then you can throw your heart loser on the good @CQ.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, I am not sure I would overcall 2S with Sandy's hand. She should have an opening hand and she does not. Again using adjusted HCP, she has 12 HCP - at least 1 for the very dubious @DQ = 11 adjusted HCP. However, if Stan opens, then it is easy to get to 4S. if Stan passes, and so does Sandy, it is harder but still possible to get to 4S.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It might go P-2D-P-P-?. Then I would double with Stan's hand. But it also might go P-2D-P-3D (or even 4D) and then it is much harder to get to 4S. But again, things worked out even if the bidding was different than what I would have recommended.|

The problem with that bid is I have 4 hearts, and we might miss a 4-4 heart fit and play in a 5-1 diamond fit instead if Sandy has a really weak hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was ok. With a weak hand, it is usually better to play in the weak hand's long suit. I am not sure even 2D makes. Had I rebid 2D, we end up losing at least 2 clubs, 2H, and 1S. And with no entries to sandy's hand I cannot  take any finesses so I lose probably at least 2 diamonds. Therefore, even had I bid 2 diamonds, it is  probably the same result or even worse.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2S was the correct bid Sandy. Just to explain further why 2S was correct. In general, when you have a weak hand with a long suit, it is better to play in the weak hand's long suit. The reason is, if you play in the long suit, the low cards in that suit will take tricks. Whereas if you play in another suit, they often will not.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on that hand, where we had a 7-card diamond fit, we do at least as well in our 6-card spade fit. BTW, 2S over 1N is to play. If sandy had an invitational or better hand, she would have bid NMF (2C).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What you might, at trick 5, do is put up the @D10 when you lead a diamond. That works when I have the @DJ. It is unlikely I have the @DAK, as I would play one of them when you lead a low diamond off dummy. So the @DQ is very unlikely to do any good.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, you got expert defense on this hand. Most declarers would make because my hand would lead a diamond rather than a spade. And you would either get a diamond ruff, or score your @DQ. You were unlucky to be playing against Sandy and me :).|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the bidding. I don't mind Ann bidding 4H. However, she was very inconsistent. 3C asked Stan to bid 4H with either a maximum 2H bid or with some club cards. Stan correctly judged to bid 3H. But Ann bid 4H anyway. So there was no point in bidding 3C if she was going to bid 4H no matter what. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could make a case in match points, Ann should invite with 3C bid whereas in IMPs I think 4H is quite reasonable over 2H. In IMPs you should bid close games, even ones that are not quite 50% because the game bonus is worth lots of IMPs. But in Match Points, you should only bid games that are favorites to make because the size of the game bonus makes no difference.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count Ann's declarer points. 12 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit = 15. Once Stan raises she adds 4 for the void and 1 for the 4+-card side club suit which gets her to 20, just enough to bid 4. So I might even bid 4 in match points, but certainly in IMPs and it turns out 4H will often make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my dummy points. 16 HCP, -1 for singleton @SK, +1 for 5 clubs, + 1 for club quality, and -1 adjust 3 = 16 Starting Points. Then add 3 points for singleton = 19 Dummy Points. So, 3D is a correct bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is almost always preferable to bid 3N. There are rare hands where 5D is better but they are hard to figure out. You will do fine if you always bid 3N when you have a choice unless you know for sure one suit is unstopped.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So even on this hand, where 5D makes and 3N might go down if everything unfavorable 3N makes anyway. So the moral is, unless you are 100% sure you don't have a stopper in 1 suit, always prefer 3N to 5 of a minor. You will come out way ahead in the long run. It is virtually always easier to take 9 tricks than 11.|

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions  and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.
