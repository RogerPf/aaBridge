^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is certainly possible for Jacquie to have 0 points. However, you have to bid based on probabilities. I have 19. On average give Ruth 8. That is 27. So between Liza and Jacquie there are around 13 (11-15 actually). On average Jacquie will have half those points, 6 or 7. Therefore, on average we have enough to be in game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice Jacquie. She did not panic with the bad split and found a way to make the contract.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now should Jacquie jump with 10 points?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It depends. With a nice 5-card heart suit, sure. I am counting on her in general to have some points, as I discussed, based on probabilities. She is a little stronger than the 6 or 7 she rates to have but her hearts are very weak and we likely have an 8-card fit at best.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because if I had 5 hearts I am likely to overcall 3@H. So 3@H was best on this hand. Had I overcalled 3@H, then she should bid 4@H, but be worried because the @SK could easily be worthless. Note if she did not have 4 hearts she should bid 2N even with a minor suit.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
nome: I know about the 2@S bid but could Jacquie consider 2N since you doubled the 2S which should give you a reasonably strong hand and she has a balanced hand?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2 comments. First, Liza should return a spade at trick 2. If Liza counts Ruth for 4 spades. So a spade can't hurt and partners always appreciate when you return their suit.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to counting your points using Bergen methodology for NT openers. Bergen says you should use starting points. So using his logic, Jacquie is too strong to open 1N with 19 starting points. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has 17 HCP, +1 for adjust-three, +1 for length. But I tend to count HCP mostly when deciding whether or not to open 1N.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I use a slightly more conservative rule. If the starting points only count to 18, I still open 1N with 15-17 HCP. But if the hand counted to 19 I would say it is too strong for 1N. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly with 14 HCP that counted to 15 starting points, I would not open 1N. But if it counted to 16 starting points I would. So I sort of agree with Bergen but am slightly more conservative.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can call me inconsistently consistent :). You don't count length when for "adjusted" HCP - Bergen Rule 20. Because "the length of your 2 longest suits" part of the rule takes length into account.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
