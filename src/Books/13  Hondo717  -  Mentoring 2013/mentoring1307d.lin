^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We are playing forcing 1NT. I would have had a problem had West passed and Jacquie bid 2@C (not on this hand). I would probably pass, hoping that we would be playing in a 4-3 club fit, rather than bidding 2@S, where I know we would be playing in a 5-1 fit. However, Jacqui could conceivably only have 3 clubs on that auction, and we could end up in a 3-3 fit. This sort of problem does occur (but fortunately very rarely) over a forcing NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You played the hand well. One important point on this hand is the spade suit. Whenever the opponents have an ^*Bodd^*N number of cards out in one of your suits, the suit will usually break as ^*Bevenly^*N as possible. So, the common example is when you have an 8-card fit, with 5 out for the opponents. The most likely break with 5 cards missing is 3-2. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you have a 10-card fit (3 missing) the most likely break is 2-1.  And, on this hand, when you have a 6-card fit (as in spades), with 7 out the most likely break is 4-3. That means once Ruth takes the Ace, all Jacquie should need to do is ruff 1 spade to set up the suit.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if the opponents have an ^*Beven^*N number of cards out, they will tend to break ^*Bunevenly^*N. With a 9-card fit (4 out) the suit will break 3-1 more often than 2-2. And with a 7-card fit (6 out) the suit will break 4-2 more often than 3-3.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was rather lucky with the hand. Note that Jacquie's double still is takeout. Since I couldn't bid spades over 1@H it is unlikely we have game. The question she needs to consider is if she is willing to defend 4H. If she is, then a takeout double is ok. But if she is not, then perhaps she should pass.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
vybdt:  A forcing defense of heart - heart, and heart will probably hold the hand to 3 - not a lot of entries in the south hand.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is true, but East is allowed by the laws of bridge to bid 4 :). I am just saying that is something you need to consider when making a takeout double. Unless you think we can make game, which given the auction is unlikely. It turns out 3@H is down 1. In IMPs, a pass works out fine.|

jacquiek:  So I should not double?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I didn't say that Jacquie. All I said is, before you double, you need to decide if you will be happy or not if they bid 4@H. If not then perhaps you should not double. In IMPs it is probably ok to pass. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points (live bridge) it is more complicated because even if we set 3H, making 3S (+140) is a better score than +50 or +100. In IMPs, on a part score hand, so long as you get some plus, that is fine. But in Match Points, you do better even if you score 10 more points than the opponents. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points if we can make 3@S or 4 of a minor, we should be there. But in IMPs, scoring +50 or +100 is fine. In IMPs think of it as total score. Another 50 points or so makes little difference. It is the big swings, failing to bid game or slam, that make the difference.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points, the size of your score is irrelevant. You just have to try and score better than other pairs, even if only by 10 points. In IMPs, if you are plus 100 instead of +110, it makes no difference. On the other hand in Match Points, if you score +110 and all the other pairs are +100, you get a top board.|

As you already know Bergen Raises are off after interference. But, you can play Bergen Raises only over 1@S and 2@C overcall by your Right Hand Opponent. However, in competition Bergen Raises do not work if the overcall is 2@D or higher. We will give her an undo.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally think Ruth has a limit raise - 3@H bid. She has 8 HCP and can count 3 for her singleton heart. That makes 11, enough for a limit raise. But we accept her bid for now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have to decide if I should bid. We only have a 9 card fit. I am discounting my @HK, so I have 9 HCP, 2 length points, +1 for quality suit. That is 12. Once we find a fit, I add 2 more for my singleton and 1 more for my 4+ clubs. That is 15. I am not sure if my hand is worth more than that.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, bidding 4@S over 4@H when you have a 9-card fit is generally good strategy. With equal vul, or we not they are, it would be clear to bid 4@S. But at unfavorable (they not we are) it is more iffy. But I am NOT HAPPY with the pass :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Jacquie. This is a rare hand where a vulnerable sacrifice against non vul opps works out because we are down 1. However, you do not get rich taking vul sacrifices against non vul opponents. 4@S over 4@H is a little more acceptable. 5@D and 5@C vul against not vul sacrifices almost never work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes if Ruth had given me a limit raise I would because then we might even make 4@S on a good day. Plus it has the added bonus of perhaps pushing them to 5@H which is why bidding 4@S over 4@H with a 9+ card fit is usually winning bridge. After all said and done, it turns out I made the wrong decision.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't know Jacquie, it is not clear. The problem is you don't know how strong Kia is. Further, you could easily be beating 4@S a couple of tricks. Your singleton @SK might easily take a trick (turns out it doesn't but I am more likely to have the SA). And you have 2 pretty sure red suit aces. So if Kia has a trick or two, you could be beating 4@S and might not make 5H. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you beat 4@S 2 doubled (+500) it doesn't even matter if you can make 5H (+450). Also don't forget that it would not be totally unreasonable for Ruth to bid 4@S over 4@H with her nice spades and singleton heart.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5 level bidding decisions are very difficult. Generally you should avoid "5 over 5" bids (e.g. when they are at the 5 level, don't overbid them) but "5 over 4" bids are much harder.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding a little bit in particular, 
a) should Jacquie bid 3@C and 
b) should Ruth try for slam over 3@C?|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


AT|
vybdt:  Yes to both :).|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the fact that Jacquie, despite only having 12 HCP realizes she has a monster hand. So although I think 3@C is a tad aggressive, it is certainly very reasonable. Once Jacquie bids 3@C, Ruth should be thinking slam in diamonds.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would be more worried about missing 7@D than not making 6. Since Jacquie has made a game forcing bid, Ruth can comfortably bid 3@D knowing it won't be passed out. Jacquie should then probably bid 4@C, Ruth can bid RKCB for diamonds, and stop in 6 when missing 1 key card. And it turns out 7 makes but only because clubs behave and the diamond hook works.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would say 6@D is a favorite but not cold. Ruth is the one who knows she has a good hand and slam is quite possible.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to why I like 1@S rather than 2@D by Kia. Although I do believe suit length is very important, and often under rated but a 5 card suit to the 8 is not a good suit unless we have a fit. Kia does not really want a heart lead, he wants a spade lead. So I think 1@S is more likely to work out.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, I could have 4 hearts and 2 spades and a good hand, and we might miss a heart fit. But it is much more likely that spades will work out better than hearts. I don't think Kia should consider his hand as 5/5, more like 5/4. :).|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
