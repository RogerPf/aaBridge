^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan did well to pass in the first round. Some might bid 2N, but he is a bit weak for that. And Sandy did well to reopen with a double despite having only 2 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being, although negative doubles are a terrific convention, once in a while responder has a penalty double but responder can't double the overcall, because double by Stan would be negative.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, when it goes 1x-overcall-P-P-?, opener with shortness in the overcalled suit, should strain to reopen with a double. It takes into account the possibility that partner might like to convert it to penalty. Such should have been the case on this hand. Stan should just pass. He has spade length and strength and an outside Ace besides.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am likely to go down. It is quite possible I will be down 2 or 3, and their side can't make anything. One thing I have noticed is, although many of my students have embraced my philosophy of "bid early bid often" which is normally a good thing. They don't have a good feel as to when it is right to defend.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, if you have length in the opponents suit, especially if your length is behind the long suit, as on this hand and shortness in pard's suit the hand could easily be a misfit.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And when the hand is a misfit, you want to defend, not declare. Granted, it is possible that EW have an 8-card or even 9-card diamond fit and that means the hand is not a misfit. But, with long trumps and 3 tricks, doubling will work out better most of the time. I will be down 2 or 3.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will probably take 1 diamond tricks and perhaps 2 or 3 spade tricks. I might get another trick somewhere, but 5 tricks is down 3.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's mention the bidding first. It is dangerous to respond when you have less than 6 HCP. So I recommend you pass with fewer than 6.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose it goes 1C-P-1D-P-2H (forcing).|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


AT|
Now you are forced to game. Even if you play short club (which I do not like particularly) and you have a singleton club but less than 6 points you should pass. You will never get in much trouble playing at the 1 level. You only have to take 7 tricks.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you can't take 7 tricks, the opponents can surely make something. So playing with knowledgeable partners, don't respond with less than 6 point.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. Stan has a tough lead. I might very well lead the @SA as that is the only unbid suit. But you should hate leading unprotected Aces because it often gives away a trick. Just like on this hand. So although the SA is plausible on this auction, Stan should not be surprised when it does not work well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice bidding and play. It is quite rare for you to have 21 HCP and have partner open. So if that occurs, your only thoughts should be:|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT|

1) should we be in a small slam or grand slam? and 
2) which suit (or NT) is best?|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, 7C is a great contract, but hard to bid. You have 12 top tricks, and will usually be able to set up a long spade with 2 or 3 ruffs for your 13th trick. And if, unluckily, spades don't break 4-3, you can at worst try the diamond finesse.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing to discuss is Stan's 2nd bid. He is a bit stuck, as he is not sure whether to play in spades, NT, or possibly even clubs. But a new suit is forcing. Personally, when forced to bid a 3-card suit, I tend to prefer bidding a minor, as it is less likely we will end up in that minor even if pard thinks we have a fit, we often end up in NT.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2D will probably work out a bit better on more hands than 2H. However, the important thing is Stan did bid a new suit, which lets him find out more about the hand. Then correctly bid RKCB to see if we had 7. 7C is very difficult to get to, and it is likely no one would get there.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |

dee_dee_20: After 2@D what will you bid?|

PG| ***** 119 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, you would ask for Aces with 4N, and then Kings.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^B@2
princesess: Is it then Blackwood or quantitative?|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, as you know, I don't think much of quantitative. If you never play quantitative I think you will do just fine. (As usual, most experts would disagree with me). The problem is you are never sure what is quantitative. If you want to play that as quantitative, then 4C would have to be Gerber. Then you give up 4C as a slam try in clubs. Let me next explain my style. However, you can decide how to play the 4NT i different bidding cycles.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is my recommendation regarding quantitative 4N.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


AT|

Your first choice (and it is a good one) is to never play it as quantitative.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


AT| 

Your 2nd choice (which is what I play), is to restrict 4N quantitative to the following 5 auctions:|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^e1) 1N-P-4N
^e2) 2N-P-4N
^e3) 2C-P-2D-P-2N-P-4N
^e4) 1x-P-1y-P-1N-P-4N or 
^e5) 1x-P-1Y-P-2N-P-4N|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|
^B@2That's it. It may not be perfect, but it is completely unambiguous. And btw, 4C in all those auctions is Gerber, and, similarly, is the only time 4C is Gerber.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||qx||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to this auction-1C-P-1S-P-2C-P-2D-P-2H-when in other words I bid 2H over 2D. That would not show hearts. It would say I am looking for NT but don't have a heart stopper. Because pard cannot have a 4-card heart suit on that auction (otherwise he would bid 2H over 2C).|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if I have hearts, I would bid 2N. So 2H is asking about hearts.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if auction goes as |ht|b|at|^j{|ia|,1CP1SP2DP2NP|at|}|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And I play (although most experts again disagree) that if no suit is established, the key card suit is the last suit bid. In this case it would be diamonds. Not perfect, but again unambiguous. To me, unambiguous auctions are more important than perfect auctions. When I play with my regular partners, we rarely have misunderstandings because we have very clear agreements. I am just giving my opinion, which I admit is different from most teachers and experts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well bid and played. The main question on this hand is what should Sandy do over 1@D. Some people play that she must show a 4-card major regardless of point count. But a better way to play is to do what she did. With 5+ clubs and a 4-card major and an opener, bid 2C first, planning to show the major later which is what she did.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


nt|^B@2
anniebmisc: 2C = GF|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann brings up a good point. First of all, if playing SAYC, 2C is not a game force, but 2C followed by a 4-card major bid would establish a game force.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing 2 over 1, there are 2 schools of thought. One is that 2C over 1D is a game force and the other is, 1D-P-2C is the same as SAYC. I have no problem if you want to play it as a game force which I think is the majority opinion these days (but not overwhelmingly).|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case, then, over 2C, if Ann had a 4-card major, you must decide the following.
Suppose the auction goes as follows:
1D-P-2C-P-2H
2H is a "reverse", but does it show extra values and longer diamonds than hearts?|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


nt|^B@2
EddyHaskel: Actually it denies 5 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|
lcmdir: Some play 2H is not a reverse.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people who play that 1D-P-2C is a game force, play that 2H there simply shows 4 hearts and says nothing about strength and length of diamonds and that is fine. You just have to agree.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, some people (including me) play that 1D-P-2C is not a game force even if playing 2 over 1. It is certainly forcing, but it just guarantees 10 points, just like SAYC. The reason being, suppose you have this hand after pard opens 1D - @Sxxx @Hxx @Dxx @CAKQxxx. I don't want to bid 1N (which is not forcing even if playing 2 over 1). 2C is much more descriptive. But if 2C is a game force, then I can't bid it. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the problem is, because, unlike over 1H and 1S, where 1N is forcing, 1N is not forcing over 1D which means when you have the 10-12 point hand with clubs, you have no good bid over 1D. However, if you are willing to not worry about that problem, there is merit to playing 2C is a GF over 1D.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played, only chance for 8 tricks. My only comment is on Ann's opening bid. I don't tend to open light in 4th seat because there is no chance our side will be missing game once pard passes. So I would have passed. Some people use the "Rule of 15" for 4th seat (which I don't particularly care for, and see no basis for).|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule of 15 says don't open in 4th seat if your spades plus HCP are less than 15. And even using that rule, Ann's hand does not qualify. However, having said that, if I held, for example, @Sx @HAKTxxx @DKJx @Cxxx I would open that in 4th seat for sure even though it is not close to meeting the rule of 15.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anna is playing 4-suit Jacoby transfer which I highly recommend you only play it with partners who can remember it well. In this minor transfer system 2S is transfer to clubs and 2N is transfer to diamonds. But that is not all. To make a 2NT invitational bid, we bid Stayman followed by 2NT (e.g., 1NT-2C-2S-2NT does not necessarily promise hearts).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, since there are two bids between the transfer bid and the transfer suit, opener now has two choices. With good support-if you have one of the top 3 honors (A, K, or Q)-opener "accepts" the transfer by not bidding the suit (1NT-2S-2NT or 1NT-2NT-3C). With less than good support, opener "rejects" the transfer by bidding the transfer suit (1NT-2S-3C or 1NT-2NT-3D).|

^-|CP||FP||CS||HT|d|AT|^B@2Transfer to minors after a 1N open comes in different flavors. |
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


AT|

In the simple version, which is what I recommend most of my students to use, 2S by responder forces notrumper to bid 3C. Responder will pass when he/she has clubs. With diamonds responder correct the 3C to 3D. This simple version lets your side play in 3C or 3D, but has no way of distinguishing whether or not opener has good support for the minor. It is generally used by responder with weak hands where one of the minors are 6+ cards and no better bid is available.|
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


AT|

If we were playing 4-suit Jacoby transfers, then 2S is a club transfer and 2N is a diamond transfer. I do not recommend this for most people because it is too easy to forget 2N is a diamond transfer. Regardless, playing 4-suit transfers, responder bids 2S. Notrumper has 2 choices of bids -- 2N says I "|CP|8|AT|like it|CP||AT|" clubs, and 3C says I "|CP||AT|don't like it|CP||AT|" clubs.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


AT|

You "like" clubs if you have if you have one of the top 3 honors (@CA, @CK, or @CQ)

2 or even 3 with one of the top 3 honors (@CA, @CK, or @CQ). The reason for that is, in the case where responder wants to bid 3N if their long club suit is running, their long suit often contains 2 of the top 3 (such as KQxxxx). If opener has the other top honor, then the suit is running. If he doesn't, then it is not running.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


AT|

So, on the hand we just had, since I do not hold the A, K, or Q of clubs, playing 4-suit transfers, I should bid 3C over 2S, as I did-don't like it. Now 3N turns out not to be a bad contract, but it will not make against best defense. Say West leads a spade. East should put up the SJ. When South starts playing clubs, West must duck twice. Now, South can never get to the board to run clubs because there are no entries (the SQ is behind the SA).|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


AT|

2N is used by responder when the diamonds being transferred. 1N-P-2N is transfer to diamonds. With one of the top 3 diamond honors (@DA, @DK, or @DQ)the notrumper bids 3C-like it, and 3D-don't like it when the hand does meet the said requirements.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.
