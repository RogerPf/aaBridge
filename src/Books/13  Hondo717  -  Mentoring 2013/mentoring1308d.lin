Then I have 2 length, 1 quality suit = 17. Therefore, we should have enough to have a play for 5 of a minor. And even if Jacquie has a singleton diamond, I should be able to play in diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way to play the club suit is to cash the @CA and lead low towards the @CQ. That way Ruth might be forced to play the @CK if she had it or perhaps the @C10 will fall. Neither happens on this hand, but playing the suit that way gives me the most options for figuring out the best way to get 3 club tricks.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I discussed why I bid 5@D, based on hand evaluation and my self sufficient suit. Because diamonds happen to run, I have 10 tricks in NT (6 diamonds 2 H, 1 S, 1 C) which is +430. But 3NT is a terrible contract. 5@D makes against many distributions, whereas 3N depends specifically on the @DQ being onside. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, 5@D is clearly right and in Match Points, I still would prefer to be in 5@D to 3N as more often than not I would get a better result.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also please note that Ruth made a very nice 3@S LOTT bid. You should all not be afraid to bid 3@S with Ruth's hand. It is often a very effective bid, as it was on this hand. Use the Law of Total Tricks when competing. It is very accurate. 3@S gave Jacquie a big problem.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Believe it or not, if I made Jacquie's @cQ the @DQ, then I might bid 3NT, because the @DQ probably solidifies my suit. But all things considered I think pass with her balanced hand is best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, to see if you had 4@S bid. She probably has some invitationalish hand. So you have to decide whether you have more than a minimum 2@S raise and you should put particular emphasis on club cards.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the contrary, given you bid 2@S, you have a great hand. You showed 6-9 or so. But you have 10 plus you have nice club cards.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people have a specific meaning for "help suit game try", but yes, it does show some club cards and asks Liza whether she has some worthwhile club cards so she can bid 4@S. To say it differently, you have a maximum 2@S raise, which is what Ruth wants to know.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are some complicated game try systems you could play when it goes 1M-P-2M but I suggest you keep it simple for now. If Opener rebids a new suit over your 2M raise that should show cards in the suit bid (not necessarily a real suit) and is asking you about how good your raise was. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If it was a good raise 8+, you should go to game. If it was a borderline raise (7) with cards in the suit bid, you should also go.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, you have already bracketed your point count with the 2@S bid. So the difference between a "good" raise and a "bad raise" is only a couple of points.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play simple game tries, it just says Ruth has something in clubs, and Liza should therefore put a little extra value on her hand if she has a club card also.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a borderline hand, where you are not sure if you have a maximum raise, what would tip the scale in favor of bidding game would be if Liza had something in clubs.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, Liza has a maximum raise so she should bid 4@S regardless of her club holding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite losing the club finesse and a spade, the hand makes. Obviously a good contract. Now let me discuss why the @SJ is not the correct play. regardless of how the spades are distributed. It cannot gain you a trick because even if I have the @SQ, I can cover and set up our @S10. There are two different ways to take finesses.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The preferable way, when you can, is to lead a low card towards an honor so if for example, Ruth had the @SKJ of spades, and led low towards the @SJ, that would be fine. But when you lead an honor out of the first hand, that is a more difficult finesse because if I cover, you waste 2 honors to finesse 1 of mine. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you need more intermediate cards to finesse by leading a  high card. If Ruth had both the @SJ and @S10 then playing the @SJ would have been fine, because then the @S10 will be set up as a winner. But missing the @S10, leading a high spade to start the finesse cannot gain a trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a 4th suit forcing bid. It is completely artificial, and says nothing about clubs-with this bid. It does establish a game force and asks West for further information. Typically West would raise with 3 spades as a first choice and bid 3N with a club stopper. Otherwise West should make anther bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, Liza should have started with 2@C rather than 1@S to establish the game force. Over 1@H, if you have a game forcing hand with a 5 card minor and 4 spades, you should start with the 5 card minor. This is true both in 2/1 and SAYC. When you later bid your spades, you have established a game force. Thus, for example, the auction 1@H-P-2@C-P-2@H-P-2@S establishes a game force.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, let's talk about what opener does with 5 hearts and 4 spades. In SAYC, if it goes 1@H-P-2@C-P-?, opener cannot bid 2@S with a minimum opener because that is a reverse. 2@C is not a game force, so opener is not sure whether or not their side has game. Therefore a 2S reverse establishes a game force and should only be done with 15+.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in 2/1 there are 2 schools of thought about the auction 1@H-P-2@C-P-2@S. One school of thought is that the 2@S bid shows extra values (it is essentially a reverse) and is looking for slam. (Remember, in 2/1 the 2@C bid establishes a game force.) The other school of thought is that 2@S is simply bidding out opener's shape, and simply shows 5 hearts and 4 spades and does not show anything extra. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I used to play the first way (where 2@S shows extra values). But Bergen recommends the 2nd way (where 2@S is simply showing opener's shape but nothing extra) so I switched to that. However, I think either approach is fine. But your partnership must agree. (I think Karen Walker discussed this in her article which was in our earlier mentoring session movie.)|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another interesting point is what you do over 1@H with 4 spades and a 4 card minor playing 2/1. Most people would bid 1@S. However, Bergen recommends you bid 2 of the minor to establish the game force and show your spades later if need be. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if playing the Bergen style, the auction 1@H-P-2@C-P-2@S-P-3@S means it is very possible that responder only has 4 clubs and 4 spades. But if you play the style most people play, then that auction means responder has 5 clubs and 4 spades, because with 4 clubs and 4 spades responder would bid 1@S over 1@H. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liza does have a problem with transportation but she probably should set up clubs immediately. If she can get back to her hand that gives her 4 clubs, 3 diamonds for sure and can come to at least 2 tricks in the majors.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There was a question about whether West should open. Even if you use Bergen "adjusted HCP" it still meets the rule of 20. 12 HCP, less one for the @CQx which gives her 11 "adjusted HCP" + 9 cards in the red suits which still equals 20. Remember, use the rule of 20, not just HCP (adjusted or not) to determine whether or not to open.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I believe in the rule of 20. You can either use the simple rule of 20, in which case your hand is definitely an opener (12 HCP + 9 cards in the reds = 21). Or if you want to use the Bergen adjusted HCP method, you deduct for dubious doubletons, add for quality suits, and add or subtract for quacks vs. ace/tens.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You never count length when deciding whether you meet the rule of 20 because the length part of the rule takes care of long suits. Basically, the only time you pass a 12 point hand is if it is 4-3-3-3 because then it only equals 19 (12 + 7) by the rule of 20.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D is a better bid Liza. Its always a good idea to further the  preempt. Whenever your partner opens a weak 2, most of the time, your bid is guided by the Law Of Total Tricks. Since we have a 9 card fit, Liza should bid 3.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would probably pass with Ruth's hand, but 3@S could be right. Let me explain why I would pass (but not clear certainly). Partner sort of expects responder to have 7 or 8 points on average because of the following. Give me 7 on average. Jacquie has 18. 18 + 7 = 25. Leaving 15 between the other 2 hands. So on average pard will have 7 or so.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Therefore, Ruth sort of has an average hand from what partner is expecting and she has a weak spade suit and she has a flat hand. So I would pass. But as I said, it is not clear. just on average she has a so-so hand. And 3@S should show something a little extra. Either more points or better distribution or a nice suit.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NMel's book has many Rule of X(s) but Rule of Frank Sinatra is in Chapter 13. He starts to outline the Jacoby 2N and responder's option for bids and continues,|

Four-card or longer support for partner.

ht|b|at|"In practice, opener's new suit response show a singleton (not a void) over 90% of the time, so I am going to presume that is what it shows in the discussion below."|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|
^*BMM: ^*NMel further explains the logic behind bidding 2N.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


AT|

"The reason we do it [bid 2N] is to determine the degree of fit of the two hands - for slam purposes. When responder bids Jacoby, only a rookie would be proud to arrive at game and make it. The issue is slam. Should we or shouldn't we?"|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


AT|

"When responder hears that opener has a side singleton, she has to
(1) analyze how well the two hands mesh and 
(2) make a bid that - given the new information about opener's singleton - either shows optimism or pessimism about slam."|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT|
^*BMM: ^*NNext he has a trip in the memory lane and explains his love for rock-and-roll and particularly for "All Or Nothing At All" by Frank Sinatra, Ol' Blue Eyes, which was Frank's first hit for Columbia records, Billboard #1 in 1943--|CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_Nothing_at_All^*N|CP||AT|.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT| 

Those who want to hear that song hey can click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.youtube.com/watch?v=u7klm1GS3v8^*N|CP||AT| link. The lyric is at the end of this presentation. After his long trip to 40s and 50s he continues.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

"Anyway, back to Jacoby 2NT and how my Frank Sinatra Rule works. Let's say opener shows a singleton. Now, if responder has either the Ace or no honor cards in that suit, she should be optimistic about slam because she has no wasted values. That's where the ^*BAll^*N (just the Ace) or ^*BNothing at All^*N (no honor cards - none) come in. With either of holdings, responder must make a bid that expresses optimism about slam. That can be done by:|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

1. Bidding three of the agreed trump suit.
2. Bidding a new suit, which in this situation is a "control" bid. "Partner, I have first-round control of this suit - the Ace."
3. Bidding Blackwood.
4. Bidding slam right then and there (not at all recommended)."|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

"Any other honor cards (Kings, Queens or Jacks) in the suit partner is short in are wasted values opposite the singleton (I'll show you examples right away). Those wasted honors make responder's hand weaker than it looks, so she should mentally turn over these wasted honor cards and discount them from her point count. Now she should count her points, and see if she still wants to broach slam. If not, she should make a bid that expresses pessimism about her side's chances for slam. There is only one such bid: four of the agreed trump suit. But enough talk, here are some examples."|

^-|cp||fp||
at|^B@2
I found mixing responses to Jacoby 2N and Frank Sinatra was interesting so we decided to do a BBO movie on it. However, we run into problem when Mel, in his attempt to reach slam with Rule of Frank Sinatra after Jacoby 2N, used control bidding style which is different than what Howard uses and like to teach.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|

Apparently, Mel recommends control bidding only with aces. However, many experts these days play "Italian Style" control bids where a control bid shows a first or second round control (ace, king, singleton, or void). Howard strongly feel that "Italian Style" is vastly superior. That is what he teaches. Nevertheless, although he is very flexible and open-minded about the different styles practiced by different experts, in control bidding it was "All Or Nothing At All." |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

So, making sure Rule of Frank Sinatra unmolested, we modified Mel's control bidding when required based on what Howard teaches with the final contracts unchanged. I hope Mel understands. We have to put some bread on the table you know -:). Please refer to this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=slamlesson3^*N|CP||AT| link for Howard's lesson "Italian Style" control bidding.|

What now? Partner has shown a singleton diamond. This is great - you have no diamond losers because your Ace covers partner's singleton. And you have no wasted diamond honors. Your King-Queen of trump are wonderful and your King-Jack of clubs have to be useful - partner has some clubs!|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You satisfy the Frank Sinatra Rule. Having only the Ace in your partner's singleton suit is what I mean by "^*BAll^*N" in "^*BAll or Nothing At All^*N." So, you must make a bid that shows optimism about slam.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you should bid 3@H. This shows slam interest (if you had no slam interest you would bid 4@H) and asks partner to begin bidding controls. Because you have  2 small spades, you want to make sure you do not have 2 quick spade losers. So if partner bypasses the 3@S control bid, you know you have 2 quick spade losers and will stop in 4@H.|MB|3hp|

PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The obvious weakness of the responder hand for slam purposes is the three losing hearts. But if opener shows a singleton heart, responder's physical heart should jump for joy and she should make an optimistic-for-slam bid:|mb|1sp2np3hp4cp4np5hp6sppp|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |

4@C = I satisfy the Frank Sinatra Rule - I have only little cards opposite my partner's singleton - "Nothing at All". Partner just covered my weak spot. I must make an optimistic bid for slam. I have the @CA.|

If we switch the hearts and clubs in the responder hand (as you see now) so that responder's hearts are @HAK7, she should jump to 4@S after opener shows a singleton heart. Her @HK is wasted and the partnership is off two club tricks.|hc|hak7c874|

This example comes from the 2006 Spingold. At one table, Jonathan Greenspan was playing with Wafik Abdou. At the other, I was playing with Janet (MM: his wife). As you can see, 6@S is lay down. How did both pairs reach it with only 28 HCP between the two hands? The auction at both tables was identical:|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


mb|1sp2np3cp3dp3sp4np5sp6sppp|NT|^B@2
3@C showed a singleton club. Both openers chose to show the singleton even though it was the Ace (although not all experts do that). In return, both responders bid 3@D, showing the @DA and making an optimistic bid toward slam because of the "Nothing at All" in clubs. |
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Opener's 3@S was encouraging for slam but denied the @HA. 4NT was RKCB - responder knew that opener had the singleton @CA. How? Well, how can opener be making encouraging bid for slam (3@S) with at most the @SAQJ, the @DK and one or both red - suit Jacks? He cannot, so he must have the @CA! The rest was easy - 5@S showed 2 "key cards" (either 2 aces or one ace and the SK). |

Now look how the Frank Sinatra Rule can help you and your partner bid a grand slam on this hand, duplicating the auction of some World Champion pairs!|MB|1SP2NP3DP3HP4CP4NP5HP5NP6DP7SPPP|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After opener shows a singleton diamond with 3@D, responder, who was interested before, now thinks, "Wow! No diamond losers. Let me show partner my heart control." Opener cooperates by showing her her club control and responder can now Blackwood. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
5@h shows two Aces no matter what form of the convention you use. 5NT asks opener for Kings, and opener shows one. Responder knows that partner's King must be the @HK. (Some show "specific" Kings, not number of Kings. It would work like a charm here.)|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After all, she has only one diamond. It's overwhelmingly likely that it's not in diamonds. Responder assumes it's the @HK. If she's right, they have no heart losers and can ruff any club losers there might be. She goes for it!|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |

This final hand shows you the power of the Frank Sinatra Rule:|MB|1SP2NP3HP4SPPP|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
4@S doesn't satisfy Frank - wasted @HK. You'd make 4@S on the above layout, but if you got to six, or on a bad day my even five, you'd be down. |

MB|1sp2np3hp4cp4dp4np5sp6sppp|

4@C = That's VERY nice. Frank is happy. I think we have a slam. I have the @CA.) |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
5@S = Two key cards plus the trump Queen if you use RKCB.|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
6@S = Let's see. I can only account for 10 HCP from partner. @DA plus @SAQ. She's gotta have the @CK.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So with 28 combined HCP, if we play in spades we either make a small slam or are limited to l0 tricks, all depending on ^*Ithe degree of fit^*N we have with partner. Let Frank Sinatra tell you and your partner if it's a fit (slam), or a poor fit (game). |

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
