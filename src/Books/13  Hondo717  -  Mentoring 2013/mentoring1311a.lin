^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, the claim was not legal as Jacquie could not be sure that the clubs are not 3-0 but we accepted it.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me first discuss my 2@D bid. In general, if partner opens 1 of a minor, although there is a chance they only have 3, over 80% of the time they have 4+. So in a competitive auction it is ok to assume they have 4 if need be particularly with a 1D opener, because most only open 1@D with a 3-card suit when they are exactly 4-4-3-2. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you should strive to raise partner with 4 in a competitive auction. Inverted Minors are off in competition. If I had a limit raise, I would bid 2@S. I like both 4@S and 5@D bids by Ruth and Jacquie. The void in spades is magic. It turns out that E/W make 5@S.

Normally 5 over 5 is not recommended and if you stick to that rule, you will come out ahead in the long run. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on this hand it turns out 5@S makes. Assuming Ruth's 4@S bid promises 5 (which it does) Barb could consider 5@S by the LOTT (11 card fit). But it is far from clear.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had Barb passed I would be forced to bid 1NT over 1@D because we play Inverted Minors. I don't have enough diamonds to bid 3@D and I am not strong enough to bid 2@D. 1@D-P-3@D promises at least 5 diamonds as does 1D-bid-3D.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East bid was fine and should not suppress a 6-card suit for bidding Michaels as one of the kibs suggested. I am a firm believer in never fudging on length with Michaels. You should be at least 5-5. If you fudge, then pard will not be able to count on the LOTT to figure out how to compete.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting sequence developed, 1@S is easy to make. BTW, for those who were wondering why I didn't open a weak 2, its because I was chatting and didn't notice I had a weak 2. I clearly should have opened a weak 2. But then the hand wouldn't have been as interesting :).|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already know I should have opened a weak 2. But once I didn't Ruth has a rule of 20 1@D opener if you use Bergen adjusted HCP (10 HCP + 1 for quality suit = 11 HCP) + 9 red cards and Jacquie has a clear 1@S bid. I might even venture 2@H at this point, since I am close to 10 and I have moderate spade support. But I passed just to demonstrate that you don't have to bid.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should Ruth reopen with a double? If partner had not been a passed hand then perhaps. But partner passed twice and does not have too many points and does not have hearts. With hearts Barb would have made a negative double. I think Ruth should just pass as it is likely our hand anyway and pard rates to be long in spades.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think Barb is a tad weak to bid 1N over 1@S. I play that 1N shows 8-10 (or at least a good 7. However, after the double, Barb might bid 1N. Yes she has a singleton heart, but Ruth rates to have something in hearts. Further, it is very difficult to set a 1-level contract.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you don't get rich by passing takeout doubles at the 1-level. So I think kib's suggestion of 1N makes a lot of sense. 2@D is another possibility. Barb knows Ruth is short in spades, and therefore must have real diamonds, at least 4 and often 5. Of course, pass could have worked. There was some merit to it. After all said, pass, 1N, and 2@D are all possible bids by Barb.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyhow, once Barb passes, I could bid 2H? That would not be terrible. But with @SKx and 9 HCP I thought we had a good shot of making at least 1@S doubled with possible an overtrick or two. Overtricks are worth 200 points so passing seemed like a good idea.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A kib suggested to use Mel's "Rule of 9" to decide whether or not to leave the double in. That rule says you leave the double in if the number of trump honors plus the number of trump plus the contract level is 9 or more. In this case 2 trump honors + 5 trumps + 1-level = 8. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So according to Mel's rule the double should be pulled if you believe Mel's rule. I think Mel is a very good teacher, but I don't particularly like rules. As you know, I try to teach basic concepts rather than "Rules". I think that is a better way to learn bridge.|

^-|CP||fp||at|
This explanation is from "Synopsis on Reopening Double" which you can find in either BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or in Howard's web site at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|. The link for the viewer is -|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/1eeqsw^*N|CP||AT|. Here we only outline the section explaining Rule of 9. BTW, Howard is not fond of "Rues" he tries to teach basic concepts rather than Rules.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|| 
%%%
st||RH||AH|Rule 9|AH|Example C|PN|You,,Partner,|sv|o|sk|S|md|1,,,|mb|1s2cppxp|NT|^B@2
Responder after a Reopening Double has the following choices:
1. Bid his/her best suit. 
2. Raise the suit of the partner with a minimum of two or more but no less. 
3. Pass for penalty when holding length and defensive values in the suit of the opponent.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||fp|1|cs|1|CP|4|at|^-{
Is there a rule of thumb or guideline for 
when to pass and    
    convert the Reopening Double to Penalty Double?    
}^-|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cs||FP||CP||NT|^B@2
Yes, many experts use Rule 9--: |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/0tm7qw^*N|CP||AT|--while some experts dislike "Rules" in general and rely on experience. They go by the length and strength in the overcall suit and lack of support for partner.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


%%http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Rule9.html
NT|^B@2
However, Rule of 9 can assist less experienced partner in arriving at the best action when forced to respond. The responder (North here) adds:

a. the level of the contract
b. the number of cards held in the suit of the opponent and 
c. the number of honors held in the suit of the opponent (this includes the 10).|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1. If the sum is |CP|8|AT|9 or more|CP||AT|, then the partner, North, should pass for penalty.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
8 or less|CP||AT|, then the partner, North, should bid on.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


%%
sk|n|MD|0,0,cAQ987|NT|^B@2
For example, with clubs holding as is shown above Rule 9 says North should pass for penalty.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


MB|P|AT|

Because the sum is 9 (2 for contract level, 5 for number of cards held in opponent's suit, and 2 for number of honors held in that suit).|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |

st||RH||AH|Rule 9|AH|Example D|PN|You,,Partner,|sv|o|sk|n|md|1,,sj2ht54cA976dt765,|mb|1s2cppxp|NT|^B@2
In this example North should bid on as the sum is 7 (2 for contract level, 4 for the number of cards held in the overcalled suit and 1 for the number of the honor in that suit).|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


MB|2S|AT| For example 2@S here.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NYou were correct and Howard would not let me get away with "flip the coin" comment. Next is what he has to say about Rule 9.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not like the Rule of 9. One big flaw is, it does not take into account how many cards you hold in partner's suit.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a singleton or void in pard's suit, that says you are likely to pass if you have length in the opponent's suit. If you have 2, it is marginal to pass. If you have 3 in pard's suit, it is almost never right to pass, regardless of what the Rule of 9 says.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on hand C, I would pass with AQxx of clubs with shortness in spades. In fact, I might even pass with AQx of clubs. And I would pass with Axxx of clubs if short in spades.|

up|29|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, Barb should really bid 2@C rather than 1@H. When pard opens 1@D and you have an opener with a 4-card major and 5 clubs, you should bid 2@C. You have enough points to make another bid. So the recommended auction would be 1@D-2@C-2N-3@H-3N.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play 2/1 you have to decide if 1@D-P-2@C is a game force or not. More people than not these days play it as game forcing. However, I do not play it as game forcing because the forcing NT is not available over 1@D. When you have an invitational hand with long clubs you have no good bid over 1@D if 2@C is forcing to game.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, over 1@D I revert to SAYC bidding. I find that tends to work out better for me. But, regardless, that is one issue a new 2/1 partnership must decide. The other big issue that must be decided is the following if it goes 1@H-P-2@C-P-2@H does that promise a 6-card suit? |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play it does and 2N is the "default" bid (e.g. you bid 2N when you have no other good bid available). I think knowing whether or not pard has 6 hearts is often very important. On the other hand, some people play that 2@H is the "default" bid and does not promise 6. Again, that is something each partnership has to decide.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to play with the bad diamond split. Let's discuss the bidding. Unless you play a convention known as "Walsh" where you always bypass diamonds to bid a major Barb should really bid 1@S because Jacquie's 1@D bid does not deny a major. With a weak hand and diamonds and a 4-card major you sometimes bypass diamonds to bid the major to make sure you get the major in before the opponents interfere. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But 1@D does not deny a 4-card major and Barb should still bid 1@S normally. However, with 4-3-3-3 flat, I think 1N had some merit.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT| 
jacquiek (Jacquie):  I do bid a 4 card major over 5-card diamonds.  Is that incorrect?|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It depends Jacquie on your agreement. If you do, then that means if it goes 1C-P-1D, pard never needs to bid a 4-card major.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, there is a whole complicated system that some experts play (Walsh). But if you just want to play 1@D denies a 4 card major you can do that. But I think if you have a hand with 6 diamonds (or even 5 good ones) and a 4 card major, you should bid 1@D. You want partner to know you have diamonds in that case.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||NT|^B@2
Kib:  So for you it is Walsh when you frequently bypass diamond suits to bid hearts or spades?|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, I will bid 1@D with a strong hand and 4 diamonds and a 4 card major. I think that is slightly better, but it is more important you agree than anything else. Of course, I only bypass diamonds with a weak hand and bad diamonds.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|^B@2
bjh346 (Barb): My regular partner and I play Walsh to right side the 1N to the strong hand.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is very reasonable Barb, and means your 1N bid was absolutely correct in this deal. However, theoretically you should alert 1N as not denying a 4-card major, although in practice very few players do. Again, I usually bypass diamonds with 6-10 unless my diamonds are very nice and my major is not.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |

KIB:  Could you make a DONT bid of 2@C over 1N by East?|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very interesting question. That is 2@C by me over 1N show clubs and another suit. The answer is, in general, no. DONT only applies over a 1N opener, not in the middle of the auction. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, several years ago Marty Bergen proposed "Delayed DONT" in which, as in this case, if you are a passed hand, DONT should apply over any 1N bid. In that case, if I bid a suit, it is a 2 suiter (so 2@C would be clubs and a higher suit) and double is a single suited hand. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do play delayed DONT with a few partners. It's kind of interesting, but unfortunately easy to forget. So I do not recommend you play delayed DONT unless a) you think it is worthwhile and more importantly b) you have a good memory :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the auction. Over 2N Ruth is obligated to show a singleton or void if she has it and then all other bids after that are "control" bids showing first or second round control (A, K, singleton, or void) in the suit bid. You control bid up the line, so if you bypass a suit, it denies a control in that suit. |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So (on a different hand) had Jacquie bid 3@H over 3@C, she would be saying "pard I have a control in hearts AND I don't have a control in diamonds." You don't control bid in trump. On the other hand, Jacquie needs to consider the @CK is wasted. The best holdings opposite a singleton are 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the ace. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In other words, opposite a singleton in partner's hand, you want length so  you can score trump tricks and no wasted honors. The A is not wasted, but all other honors should be discounted. The @CAK is not a good holding for Jacquie because of both the shortness and wasted king. |
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example on this hand, if we make the @CK the @SK then they make 6 with the same HCP. I am not saying she should not control bid, I am just saying she should be more cautious.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a separate issue, a jump to 4 over 2N does show a 5-card suit and some people play that is all that it shows but a better way to play it is first to consider that the jump to 4 takes up a lot of room. I recommend that a jump to 4 shows a 5-card suit that is a potential source of tricks -- it has at least 2 of the top 3 honors.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That way pard knows if they have a top honor in that suit, it is extremely valuable. Jumps to 4 are rare, they are only done with a very good 5-card suit. With a mediocre 5-card suit, just show your singleton. That keeps the bidding lower and makes it easier to get to slam when appropriate.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the subject of Bergen Raises, the easiest thing to do is to play they are off in competition  and that is what most people do. However, if you want to play them in competition, there are a couple of situations where you could decide to play them. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The easiest (and pretty effective) place to play them on is over a takeout doubles. For example 3@C in 1@S-x-3@C is a Bergen Raise as 3@D in 1@S-x-3@D. I recommend you start with that.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent Bergen Raises, 2N in 1@S-x-2N would show a limit raise. So what I play is that shows a 3-card limit raise and 3@D (regular Bergen) or 3@C (reverse Bergen) shows the 4-card raise. There are 2 other competitive situations where you might (or might not) play Bergen Raises.|

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
