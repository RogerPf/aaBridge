^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let us comment on the double. Normally double shows close to an opening hand. Granted Ann is a passed hand so she obviously has less. With her great distribution she should want to compete. However, a more appropriate bid would be 2C or 2D, assuming partner would take that as Michaels.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether 2C or 2D is Michaels. I play both are Michaels, and I recommend you do too. Some experts play both as natural because 1N (or 2N) by Ann could be construed as unusual NT. Some play 2D is natural, showing 6-card suit behind the diamond bidder, but 2C is Michaels, since the clubs would be in front of the club bidder.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I think it is easier and less confusing if you play all those as Michaels/Unusual NT. I think you should play all cue bids  as Michaels to avoid confusion.|

mb|p|SB|S|sk|s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a bidding sequence where depending on my hand, I might want to protect against Stan having a penalty double. Whenever you open, there is an overcall, and it goes pass-pass, you need to think about that possibility. Remember if partner doubles after the overcall, that is negative.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Occasionally partner will have a penalty double which he can't make. So you as opener must protect by reopening with a double. However, that does not apply on this hand. If I were short in clubs, then it is possible. It is very unlikely Stan has a club stack because I have 3 clubs and Sandy has at least 5.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I have no good bid and should pass. Having 3 small in the opps suit is the worse holding you can have, particularly when they do not necessarily have a fit. On the other hand, I should reopen, regardless of how strong my opener was if I were short of clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few other comments on the bidding. Stan should probably make a negative double. yes he is rather weak, but we are not vulnerable, and there is a good chance we have a major suit fit. As it turns out we have an 8-card heart fit. The way the cards are we only have 5 obvious losers -- 2 clubs, 2 diamonds and 1 spade so we might make 2H.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann should pass 2C as she did but if she had a couple more points, she might consider 2N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't play inverted raises, then 2C shows 6-9 with 4+ clubs. However, I would still bid 1N with the East hand. If your hand was unbalanced, particularly with a singleton, then 2C might be a good bid. But with flat distribution, 1N is more descriptive and probably a better contract more often than not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has the right distribution for a takeout double. However, she is a little light on points to double over 1C. On the other hand, once it goes 1N-P-P, now she should double although on this hand we only have 2 7-card fits (red suits). |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is very likely in general we have a major suit fit and letting the opps play 1N is usually not going to be a good result for you. So I personally would have doubled with Sandy's hand over 1N. Not sure, if they let us play there how well we do. But there is some possibility that Ann will bid 3C over my 2D bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan made a nice 4C bid but my 3H bid put him under pressure and made it hard to find 3N. They could be missing a spade game or even a club game, or perhaps 3N. If a diamond is led, because diamonds are 4-4, they make 3N. Only losing 3 diamonds and 1 heart. If a heart is led, they make 3N, taking 2H, 2S, and 5C. I don't think I double with Sandy's hand, but it certainly proved effective here.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The moral of this hand is, if you follow the law of total tricks, you more often than not get a good result. 3N was a possible bid with Stan's hand, but 4C was quite reasonable as well. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At most he has 25 HCP and your side could have as little as 23. So 3N, although it has upside, is a bit risky particularly with the red suit situation unclear.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain a little bit about match points vs IMPs. In IMPs the size of your score matters. So the extra 500 for making a vulnerable game is very valuable, as it is worth 8 IMPs or so. Therefore, it behooves you to bid all games (esp vulnerable ones) that are close to 50%, even a little less because the reward for making far outweighs the risk if you go down.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you go down you probably lose around 4 or 5 IMPs. If you make you gain 8 imps. So even if you go down twice for every close game you make, you will break even. Therefore, in IMPs stretch to bid game. On the other hand, in Match Points the size of your score does not matter. It only matters if you get a better score than someone else. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So whether you beat someone by 10 points or 100 points or 1000 points, you only get 1 Match Point for getting a better score. Therefore, you do not want to bid a game that is less than 55% or so because if you make you gain half a MP (you get 1 point for beating whoever did not bid game vs 1/2 point for tieing them).|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If most people are not bidding game and you do and go down, you are getting 0 MP. Whereas if you settle for a partial you will get an average board. Of course if you make you get a top board. So 50-55% games are ok to bid. anything less is not ok. In Match Points, you try for average and average plus boards and try to avoid bottoms.|
