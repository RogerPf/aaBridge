up|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK Stan. you made the same strange play twice-trick ten and 12. You had 2 cards left in a suit, one that you knew was high, and one that was not high and you played the card that was not high. You did that both in spades and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to do that, unless you are trying to set up a 3rd card in that suit. Play the high card first. Maybe the lower card will become good.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the opening lead. I know a lot of experts think you should lead an unbid major against NT. I think the old standby, 4th from longest and strongest works best. Assuming the opponents have not bid the suit.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, here, I would lead a diamond against a NT contract with Sandy's hand and, as you can see, it works well on this hand.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^b@2
enia_t: Leading from Ace-Queen is accepted then?|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Only against NT is a diamond lead reasonable. You do not lead from Ace-Queen in a suit contract because quite often only 2 rounds will go through before a suit gets ruffed. Therefore, if you give away a trick, you may never get it back.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in NT, you are trying to set up the low cards in your long suit. Therefore, even if your lead ostensibly gives up a trick you will often get it back by setting up your long cards in the suit.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, if Sandy leads a diamond, their side will score 3 diamond tricks even if Stan gets his king. But say for the sake of argument we were playing in a club contract then, if Sandy led away from her AQ of diamonds, Stan would score his DK, and Sandy would only get 1 diamond trick because South is ruffing diamonds after the 2nd round.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your objectives on opening lead are often different in suits than in NT. In NT, you are trying to set up the low cards in your long suit. Therefore, it is ok to lead away from honors, even aces. But in suits, you are trying to establish fast tricks and you should try to avoid leads that could easily give away a trick.|

irinica:  Wasn't this a light opening?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a light opener. I use the rule of 20. The rule of 20 says you should open the bidding if your ^*Bstandard HCP^*N + the length of your 2 longest suits is 20 or more. I have 11 HCP + 9 cards in the minors = 20.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^b@2
gimit: No Quick Tricks specified with the rule of 20?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play you should not open without 2 "Quick Tricks." Quick Trick represents how many fast tricks you can take. On this hand I only have 1.5 quick tricks-@DA = 1 quick trick and @CK = 0.5 Quick Tricks. Therefore, some would not open. but I do.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My style of opening is I open all hands which meet the rule of 20. And pass all hands that do not, even in 3rd seat (where many experts open light). |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^b@2
 athni: But the @SQ10 is a dubious 2 points?|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a different evaluation athni. For those who use Bergen hand evaluation the @SQ10 is a "dubious doubleton" and Bergen deducts 1 point for that. However, Bergen adds 1 point for the club quality suit. Let me explain Bergen's Rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen uses "^*Badjusted HCP^*n" + the length of your 2 longest suits. The "^*Badjusted HCP^*n" is Starting Points less the points for length.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Starting Points has the following components:
^c@21) count the raw HCP; on this hand you have 11 raw HCP
^c@22) add points for each quality suit; I have 1 quality suit-clubs
^C@23) subtract for Dubious Doubleton/Singletons; I have 1 @SQ10-A dubious short suit is a Q or J doubleton, or a singleton K, Q, or J.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^B@2
^C@24) add or subtract for "adjust 3"; I have none-"adjust 3" basically adds an extra point if your hand is rich in Aces and Tens and subtracts a point if it is rich in Queens and Jacks.

^C@25) add 1 point for each card in each suit that has more than 4 cards in it-not for Rule of 20.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann is close to a double. Her singleton diamond is great as is her Aces and King. You can't have the perfect shape always. However, you do need an opening hand to double. In pass out seat I would for sure I double with that hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is tough for me to know what is right if I was playing at regular table and could not see the other hands. Let me give you some general rules for bidding "5 over 5." Generally, you should avoid it. However, if you are short in the opponent's suit, that is a plus. You almost never bid 5 over 5 when you have a doubleton or higher. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you are pretty sure you can set it and there is good possibility of setting it 2, then you should double. Here I do have a singleton and a really nice suit. But the problem is, I don't know if Sandy has a good hand or not.|

 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I don't worry too much about pushing them into a makable slam. After all said and done, I think on this hand 5H is indicated, but it could definitely be wrong.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us renew discussion about Ann's possible bids.|SK|N|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main argument for Ann doubling is being short in diamonds which makes it more likely that I have diamonds. And if I have diamonds I will often not have a bid over 3D if she passes. So if she passes, there is a good chance I will have to pass as I will not have a bid. Doubling lets us get to 3N if it makes, in addition to 4 of a major. But pass is certainly reasonable as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A spade by Stan was quite reasonable but a heart lead makes it more interesting.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a club loser. As you all can see on this hand everyone makes because the spade finesse works. However, you should avoid finesses if there is another line, and there is on this hand potentially. That is I can try and set up clubs. Let us watch.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lesson on this hand is only rely on a finesse if you have to. If you can find an alternative do so.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now comes the postmortem. By looking at four hands a double by me would have been much better as they are down 3 doubled which is 800.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could make a case for me bidding 1N here to show my points. I have slightly flawed distribution and very nice diamonds. So, 2D is probably better. But when 1N is a possible bid, you should make it. 1N overcall is 15-18.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all Stan's 3H bid is a weak bid. Although in general new suits by responder are forcing. If responder bids a weak jump shift, not only is that not forcing but is almost always passed even if opener has a void in the bid suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I might very well have bid 4 with Stan's hand. He has an 8-card suit and some spade values to fit with partner and a void. The only flaw is the 3 diamonds. The worst holding you can have in the opponent's suit is 3 small.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turned out Stan was right to bid only 3. But I would bid 4 as the reward of making game justifies the risk. I would have been wrong on this hand.|
