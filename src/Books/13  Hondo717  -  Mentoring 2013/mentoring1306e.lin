^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You played that well Jacquie. A couple of comments on the bidding. West might venture 2@D over 1@H with her nice suit. But many would pass with only 9 HCP and the dubious @CQ. 2@D, on the other hand, it is a good lead directing bid. The disadvantage is they have not found a fit, and West is rather weak. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nevertheless, over 1@S I probably choose 2@D. You rarely get a good result playing at the 1 level. If it passed, East/West probably make 2@D - taking 2 spades, 2 clubs, and probably 4 diamond tricks - or maybe down 1.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 2@D, Jacquie might bid 2@H which is down 1. However, over 2@H, Ruth might (but should not) bid 3@D. If West had bid 2@D over 1@H right away, then Ruth should raise diamonds. When West "balances" with 2@D over 1@S, she must be weakish (did not bid 2@D right away) so Ruth should only raise with 4-card support. Otherwise she is punishing west for competing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C over 1@S by me is aggressive but not totally unreasonable. Further, West made the classic mistake many bridge players make - tried to "rescue" partner. The rule is when you have a misfit, stop ASAP. Most of the time it works better. Although on this hand probably does not matter much. They do have a heart fit but can't find it.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets discuss the 1@S opening. I would personally open 2@S and my 2nd choice is pass. The hand is close but does not quite meet the rule of 20. As it turns out, had Jacquie passed 2@S, it ends up the same. |

But she has weak 5-card suits, and points in our suit. In fact more than half her HCP are in our suit. That should make you more cautious.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice Liza. Assuming Ruth had passed, some inexperienced players might bid 3@S with my hand, assuming that was forcing. But the auction 1C-P-1S-P-3S shows a medium hand 17-19 Bergen Dummy Points, 16-18 by classic point count. So, 1C-P-1S-P-3S is not weak. remember I opened 1@C. However it is not forcing. It asks the 1@S bidder to bid 4@S with 8+. So my bid is 4@S (or a splinter if I had a singleton).|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I bid 3@S, Liza can count 7 HCP, 1 length point, 1 point for 2 doubletons, 1 point for outside club suit for 10 declarer points and should bid 4@S over 3@S. Further, since I opened 1@C, it is a double fit and that is worth a point or two as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Ruth. I think these days a majority of 2/1 players play that 1D-P-2C as a game force. I personally prefer it not be game forcing. However, it definitely needs to be discussed. My hand is an example why. My reasoning is the forcing 1N is not available over 1@D. So when you have the 10-11 point hand with clubs, you have a bidding problem.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT forcing only applies to auctions where the opening bid is 1@H or 1@S. If you think about it, you cannot play it over 1@D openers, because what would opener's rebid be when he has a 4-card major with 3 or 4 diamonds?|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If 1D-P-1N-P-? were forcing, on most hands opener would not have a rebid. Say for example his distribution was 3 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds, 2 clubs. If 1N were forcing, what could opener rebid? 2@D with a 4-card suit? 2@H, which would be a reverse into a suit where it is not possible to have a 4-4 fit (responder denies 4 hearts by bidding 1N)?|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since 1@H and 1@S promise at least a 5-card suit, it is possible to play 1N forcing over those bids. But over 1@D, which only promises 3 diamonds, it is not viable to play 1N forcing. Therefore I play 1D-P-2C reverts to SAYC bidding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me comment on "super accepts" after 2N opener although theoretically responder can have 0 points - extremely rare. And since the 2N opener is quite strong once a 9-card fit is found (10 on this hand) it is likely game will make even opposite a weak responder. By super accepting you might get to some nice hard-to-bid slams. I recommend you super accept any time you have 4+-card support. You will rarely be overbid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of comments on the play. On the spade lead, Liza should take the first spade. That way she guarantees only 1 spade loser, since she has the @S109 left. If she ducks, and I happen to have the SK (unlikely on the lead but so what), she could lose 2 spade tricks. By taking the ace she has 1 spade loser regardless of where the @SK is located.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other comment is I suggest you count out not only trump but your 2nd longest suit which on this hand is spades. Had Liza kept track of spades, she would have realized her last spade is good, and been able to throw a club limiting her club losers to one. She needs to realize her S3 was good. Experts keep track of all 4 suits, but I know that is hard. But I think many of you should be able to keep track of 2 suits.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }

Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
