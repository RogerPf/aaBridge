^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are some definite issues with the bidding here. Everything through the double was fine and Sandy certainly can pass, but might consider bidding 2C with her nice suit (although better if 6 cards). So pass and 1@S were fine. However, now Stan has a problem. With such a strong hand, their side could easily have game. Whether and whether is not clear.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It could be in spades, it could be in hearts, or it might conceivably be in NT. Trying to solve the problem by bidding 2H is not the way to bid. 2@H bid is a "double and correct." |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you make a takeout double partner assumes initially you have the 3 other suits covered. Then, if after partner chooses a suit and you change suits, that is called a "double and correct" because you are "correcting" partner's bid to your own suit.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double and correct has a specific meaning. it shows a good hand (at least a good 16). Stan certainly has that. However, it also shows a  good 6-card suit, which Stan does not have. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So what should Stan bid? The best bid would be 2@C - cue bid of opponents' suit. If Stan had a club stopper, then 1N would work. An original 1N bid in the balancing seat would show 11-14. But a double and "correct" to 1N shows about 15-18. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, Stan is both slightly too strong and lacks a club stopper. If Stan had 17 or 18, I might bid 1N anyway with his hand, because based on the auction, it is quite possible partner has some clubs (clubs were not raised or rebid). But 1N with his hand is a bit of a misbid for 2 reasons.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He is too strong and he lacks a club stopper. So the way to solve the problem is to bid 2@C. The meaning of this cue bid is "partner I have a good hand but am not sure what to do", "please help me out." Over 2C Roberta has several choices. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N would probably be my choice. That would show a club stopper and around 6-9 points. 3@S is another choice but you could easily miss 3N. Stan should then bid 3@S (which is forcing) and Roberta would bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S by Stan is possible as well - it is a bit of an underbid. 3@S by Stan, however, is an overbid particularly because he only has 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT| My choice for auction is as you see now.|UB|11|mb|1CPPxP1SP2CP2NP3SP4Sppp|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


at| On this auction 2N shows a club stop. This was a difficult and interesting hand. One that most players would not know how to bid. The bottom line is, when you are not sure what to bid, sometimes a cue bid is the best bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is, whether that 4@C is forcing. Absent an overcall, most people play 4C is forcing. But after an overcall, it is not as clear. It should also show some heart tolerance because if I don't like clubs I need to be able to retreat to hearts. On this hand, at the table I would bid 4H. Since we are at the 4 level anyway, might as well be in game.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was another interesting and hard to bid hand. Let me just suggest the following to Stan. If you intended to bid 4@S over 4@H, then you should bid 4@S right away. One of the things experts do is try to anticipate likely auctions and plan their bidding accordingly. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most experts would decide, as Stan did, that it is right to bid 4S over 4@H. Granted, it is conceivable it could go 3@H-3@S-all pass. But 3@S is only right if the auction goes that way and you make exactly 3@S which is pretty unlikely.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, given Stan (very reasonably) decided he was going to bid 4@S over 4@H, he should bid 4@S right away to make it harder for us to figure out what to do. On this hand it is likely to make no difference as Sandy is probably doubling. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But it will often make it much tougher. Remember, it is always better to bid more in competitive situations (assuming you have the distribution) because you want to make it harder for the opponents to make the right decision. The less room they have, the more difficulty they will have in guessing correctly.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The more room they have, the better chance they have. N/S do make 4@H. They lose 2 hearts and 1 spade for sure. If I guess the heart suit, I make 4, but it is likely I will lose 3 hearts. The point is, whether 4@S is right or not on this hand, once Stan decides he is going to bid it, he should bid it right away.|

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.
