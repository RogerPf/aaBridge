^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth should make a quick count. She started with 7 clubs. There were 2 clubs on board and I led the @c4. Therefore, Kia must be out of clubs because I could not have started with doubleton and lead @c4. The @C2 ad @C3 has been played. So if we don't take our heart tricks right away, we might not get them. Particularly I may have @HK. Therefore, @HA is the correct play as @SK is not the correct card to play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia played the hand correctly, and was very unlucky to go down. He should try to go to the board with a diamond and take the spade finesse. The 6-1 diamond break is very unlikely, so although the diamond happens to get ruffed on this hand, that will almost never happen. (It will be a year before Kia encounters another 6-1 break.) |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although it turns out if he just cashes the @SA, the @SK will fall and he makes the hand, most of the time if he does that, the @SK will not fall and he will go down.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, you should not be a "results" player. Just because a particular line of play works, it does not mean it is the correct line of play. When analyzing a hand, you should figure out what the line of play is that gives you the best odds of making the hand. In the long run, you will do better if you always choose the best line of play. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed the first point of this hand, which is when you defend, take advantage of partner's signals. When partner leads your suit giving count you can often figure out exactly what is going on in the suit. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, I play a lead convention known as 3rd and 5th best. That means you lead 3rd best from 4 and low from 5 or more. The reason I do that is because it helps determine whether partner started with 4 or 5 which can often be crucial on defense (but you must count the suit out). |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Counting on defense is one of the biggest differences between experts and non-experts. Experts are always counting out the hand -- both distribution and high cards. Non-experts rarely count the hand out. It is really not that hard, and will really improve your defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth should not violate one of my cardinal rules by bidding 2@S. The rule she would be violating is that, if you have 4-card support, you must show it immediately. Failure to show immediate support denies 4-card support. Knowing that you have a 9-card fit is crucial. So, correctly, she is showing a limit raise or better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like my hand more (particularly my diamond shortness) but let's count  mydeclarer points. 10 HCP + 1 length point + 1 quality suit point = 12. Adding 2 for the singleton, 1 for the 4 card side spade suit brings the value up to 15. So we might only have 25, 1 short, but I can't take the chance of missing game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a little tricky to play. I could try to ruff 2 clubs. But if trumps are 3-1 despite the fact that I started with 9, I may end up losing control of the hand if they make me ruff diamonds. So the best line is to draw trumps, leaving a trump in dummy and then knock out the @SAQ and pitch one club on the long spade. Of course on this hand, as we will see, hearts are 2-2 so there is no problem.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can see Bergen hand evaluation got us to a game with only 19 HCP between us. Once again proving that HCP are only a small part of the picture when evaluating hands. Distribution (length and shortness) and fit are equally as important.|

toasterln:  How about looking at a 5@D contract for E/W.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes Liza also might have decided she had a limit raise and bid 2@H. She has 7 HCP, 2 length points, 1 point for doubleton heart, 3 points for singleton spade for 13 dummy points. It turns out they lose 2 hearts and 1 club for sure and if I lead a heart and Ruth shifts to a club, she will get 2 club ruffs. So on best defense 5 diamonds is down 3 which is still better assuming it is not doubled than us making 4@H and a) it might not get doubled b) we might not find the best defense and c) we might bid 5@H.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||NT|^B@2
BTW, it turns out that E/W can beat the contract although it is not easy to see. If West switches to a spade at tricks 2, then they get 1 diamond, 2 spades and a ruff. Thanks to one of the kibs for pointing that out. Perfect defense is hard, which is why it pays to be aggressive.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk a little more about the bidding. It is rare that you get 21 HCP after an opening bid. But sometimes you get fairly strong hands (18+) so you should learn the best way to bid them. That is where the famous "double and correct" comes to help. If you double and then correct whatever partner bids to a new suit or NT, that shows a strong hand. So Ruth's first bid should be double.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||NT|^B@2
On this hand, Liza will bid some ## of spades (I choose 3@S or 4@S) but let's for the moment assumed she passed and bidding goes as 1D-x-p-1s-p-?. If Ruth now bid 1NT for example that would show 18-20 or actually 19-21. A "double and correct" to NT shows that sort of hand.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course on this hand, that would not happen. So Ruth would have more difficulty in deciding what to do. I would have probably bid 4@S over the double with Liza's hand, and that would not work out that well.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia would still lead either a heart or club (Kia knows not to lead a suit bid by the opponents) and 4@S is down 2. Thus, Liza being conservative worked out a little better for us. It turns out E/W cannot make much of anything.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if Kia leads anything but a club, 3@S is down another trick. But he followed my maxim, "Leading partner's suit is usually right, rarely wrong."|

qx|R7, RULE OF 7|bt||
ht|b|CS|1|CP|4|HT|b|FP|3|at|^-{      Rule of 7      }
^-|CP||fp||at|Before we deal with rule of 7 let us define "Hold up, Ducking from wikipedia,|CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_up_(bridge)^*N|CP||AT| , which practically is the logic behind Rule of 7.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


cp|4|CS|1|FP|3|AT|

^-{In the card game of contract bridge,
to hold up means to play low to a trick led by the opponents,
  losing it intentionally in order to sever their communication.  }|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

{The primary purpose is to give as many tricks to opponents as needed
to exhaust all the cards in the suit from one of their hands.
  If that hand regains the lead, it will not be able to put the partner on lead  
to cash its tricks. Hold up is one of basic techniques in play.}|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|

{While mechanically identical, a hold up is in a suit played by the opponents
while a duck (or ducking) is a manoeuver in one's own suit.
Nevertheless the terms are used interchangeably
with duck or ducking more common.}
^-|CP||CS||FP||
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|
Rule of 7 is useful to sever communications between opponents when playing a Notrump contract with losers in opponents' suit and insufficient quick tricks to guarantee the contract. To determine the number of times holding back before winning the trick, declare subtracts his side's combined cards from number 7. For example if the combined cards in the suit led is 5 then declarer holds back twice - 7 - 5 = 2. If the combined cards is 4 the he must hold back three times - 7 - 4 = 3. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

Of course, the Rule of 7 should not be used when the declarer has the required number of tricks to make the contract. He should instantly win the opening lead and proceed to secure the contract unless he is in MP scoring and is reasonably assured of extra trick or tricks. Let us look at a few examples.|

South hads 5 sure tricks. He needs 4 more. The club suit is the only source for the rest of tricks needed to make the contract. He has to hope East has the @CA and only 3 diamonds.|

East does not have a diamond to play so his partner can win 2 more diamonds and set the contract. Of course Declarer can do nothing if West has the @CA. But with 12 HCP, if we add @CA to his hand, West would have opened.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThat is the extent of Rule of 7. However, like anything else in bridge there are many fine prints. Mr. Larry Cohen has a compelling argument comparing of "Rule of 7" and "Rule of Thinking" |CP|1|at|^*Hwww.larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=436^*N|CP||AT| which we will look at next.|

^-|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


CP||CS||FP||AT|

To prove the superiority of the "Rule of Thinking" Mr. Cohen compares the result in 4 deals using both Rules. In each deal declarer is playing 3N and has heart holding of @HA875  opposite @H4. First he plays the hand using Rule of 7 and next using Rule of Thinking. Of course the results proves his point. However, I wonder whether the result would be the same using random heart holding. Regardless, let us go through his experiment.|

NT|^B@2
So let us do that and let East win the trick.|pc|h4|PC|h9|PC|h5|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
East now can switch to clubs. Regardless whether declarer holds back or wins the first club with his @CA, eventually he has to play a diamond and lose the lead to East who can win enough clubs to set the contract.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now let us back up and try the "Rule of Thinking" for comparison.|sk|s|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


up|3|NT|^B@2
The Rule of Thinking says to win the first heart and don't hold up. Why?|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because from the lead of the deuce (4th best), declarer knows the hearts are splitting 4-4.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NLet us state the obvious. Because, @H2 is the fourth best and the lowest card, West cannot have more than 4 hearts and declarer can see 5 hearts. So East has only 4.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
Not only does that make a hold-up play irrelevant, but it gives the defense a chance to switch to a devastating club and defeat the contract. Winning the first heart produces 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The scores are "Rule of 7" zero and "Rule of Thinking" 1. On to the next experiment.|

NT|^B@2
Holding up twice (winning the third round) caters to this very common 5-3 split. East's @HQ wins the first trick. You let the @H10 hold the second trick. On the third heart, there is no benefit to holding up again (if they are 4-4, it won't matter). So, you win the third round of hearts and play clubs.|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |

If one defender has 5 hearts and the CA, there is nothing you can do about it. Here, the holdup play (twice) leads to 10 tricks.|

NT|^B@2
If you win an early heart, you won't know the heart split. Even winning the third heart is not safe. What if West started with @HKQJ and East with @H109xxx? Then when you take the diamond finesse, you risk defeat - if East has the @DK.|

With it, you would have woodenly held up twice on each deal. In Real Life, the correct play was to hold up 0,1,2, and 3 times. This should put the Rule of 7 into "Rule Heaven."   Maybe the "Rule Graveyard" is a better phrase.|

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
