^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lots to discuss here about the bidding. Let us look at how to bid after 1N overcall.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||
pn||st||RH||ah|Example A|md|1,S239JQHJAD4QKC78A,,|sv|o|mb|1C|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding after a strong NT overcall has its own set of rules. 2 things are very different.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

Firstly, double|MB|d|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


AT| is penalty, not negative double. it typically shows 9+ points and a willingness to defend.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|
 
Secondly, and many do not know this, because you double with a good hand, new suits are weak and not forcing. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|| 
%%
pn||st||RH||ah|Example B|md|1,S239JQHJAD4QKC78A,S5TKH569QKD235JC9,|sv|o|mb|1C|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example in this example, if North had chosen to bid 2H|MB|2h|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|, that just shows long hearts, and is to play.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

The concepts of bidding over a 1NT overcall are similar in many ways to how you bid over a takeout double.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||
%%
pn||st||RH||ah|Example C|md|1,,,|sv|o|mb|1C|mb|D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you know over a takeout double|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


mb|r|at|  a redouble is strong and|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


UB||at| all new suit bids |MB|2H|AT| such as 2@H here are not forcing and weak.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is just like bidding new suits over 1NT overcall.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT| 

Next let me go to overcaller's partner (the advancer) bidding options.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||
%% 
pn||st||RH||ah|Example D|sk|w|md|1,S239JQHJAD4QKC78A,,s864 h87432ct5dt97|sv|o|mb|1C|mb|1N|mb|d|an|penalty double|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East (the advancer) probably should play systems off over a double, so she can play all suits natural - 2@C, or 2@D, or 2@H are natural and to play.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT| So East, if she played that with the hand as is shown above,|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


SK||at| would bid 2H.|MB|2H|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||sk|w|ub||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, 2@C |MB|2c|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at| and|UB||MB|2d|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT| 2@D|at| would also be natural.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||ub||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could also play "DONT Runouts", but since a penalty double of 1NT is rare I am not sure you need to bother learning them. But just as a point of interest, DONT Runouts work as follows:|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 1N - penalty double, redouble is a single suit (similar to the DONT double of 1NT). The 1N bidder bids 2C, and the re-doubler passes with clubs or corrects to their suit.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suit bids over the double are DONT in nature. They show that suit and a higher ranking suit. So 2C shows clubs and another suit, 2D shows diamonds and a major, 2H shows hearts and spades.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, just as in regular DONT, the NT bidder passes with 3-card support, and bids the next higher suit with a doubleton. The reason being, the NT bidder has at most 1 doubleton, so you are guaranteed a 4-3 fit at worst.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As many of you know, my wife and I play weak 1N openers (10-13). In that case, DONT Runouts work superbly. We even play them over artificial doubles. But if you play strong NT, you are rarely doubled for penalty, so DONT Runouts are probably not a learning priority.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||

pn||st||RH||ah|Example E|md|1,,,|sv|o|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Please note I am not talking about a DONT double as in this bidding.|mb|1N|mb|d|an|a long suit to be determined|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over an artificial double, such as a DONT double showing a 1 suited hand, I suggest you play systems on (Stayman, transfers, etc.) and just ignore the double. It is only over a penalty double that systems should be off.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a real interesting hand. 1@C was fine and so was 1@H, although 2@H would also be acceptable. It is borderline between 1@H and 2@H. However, Sandy missed an opportunity. She should bid 3@C (preemptive, 5 clubs) not 2@C. Remember, inverted raises are off in competition. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H by Sandy is a limit raise. When you have less than a limit raise, make the LOTT bid. In the minors it is a little tricky because theoretically pard could have only 3 clubs. But in a competitive auction, you should assume at least a 4-card suit. So the LOTT action with Sandy's hand is 3@C.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Turns out it doesn't matter, because I am bidding 4@H and Stan has a clear 5@C bid, even over 2@C. On the other hand, Ann  has a clear pass.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


AT| 
anniebmisc: I thought with 6 in my hand could go to 5.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At this vulnerability, 5H is dangerous for 2 reasons.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One is you can get doubled and go down 2 if I have a weak hand. And the other is, you might push them into a making slam. Yes, although a strict LOTT bid says 5H is ok because we probably have an 11-card fit. It is rarely right to bid 5 over 5 when you are vulnerable, unless you are pretty sure you are making it.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
anniebmisc: And their non-Vul game is only 400.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After all said and done, 5H doubled works out great (since they make 5C). They actually make 6C should they choose to bid it. In fact, if somebody chats to Stan that Ann has the SK singleton :) he makes 7.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
stanira3: I was tempted...but not sure enough.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your double was good Stan. It is hard to make the perfect decision on these auctions. I probably would have done the same thing. But hands with voids are "magic" and often are worth 2 tricks or more than even hands with singletons. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So whenever you have a void in the opponent's suit, it is right to be super aggressive. If you go down 2 you are ahead if we make 5@H. But behind if we don't. I think most experts would double with Stan. But I don't know. these hands are hard.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer 4H here. But 2S is a distant third after 2N (either Ogust which I prefer or asking for feature). Most people play a new suit as forcing. The term for bidding over Weak-Twos is "RONF" (Raise Only Non Force). But I actually play that as non-forcing as recommended by Bergen. But for now we accept 2S bid and will play it forcing here. I will have more comments later.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan can count 8 sure tricks-4 spades, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs. He needs one more trick. His best hopes are to establish a heart trick, or take the spade finesse. Playing a heart at trick 2 is fine. However, when Sandy plays the Jack, he should play the King. Sandy could easily have @HQJ or even perhaps @HAJ. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if Ann wins the HA, Stan has knocked out 2 honors with one of his. And if hearts are 3-2, he is guaranteed a heart trick. Once hearts don't work, he should try for the spade finesse. That doesn't work either, but even on this hand, with all the bad breaks, he should take 8 tricks.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need less when you have a fit, more when you do not. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 4-card support always bid 4-LOTT. If you have 3-card support, bid 3 most of the time. With 18+ Dummy Points and 3 card support bid game.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 15-17 and play Ogust, bid 2N (Ogust) and see if partner has a maximum or not and then decide where to place the contract. Let me expand on this hand and responding to Weak-Twos in general.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan should consider bidding 4H rather than 2S and 3N on the next round. We have an 8-card fit. In general, when someone pre-empts, it is usually right to play in their suit. On this hand, it turns out that because of the very unlucky lie of the cards, 4H is probably down 1, as the defense will take 3 hearts and 1 diamond. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But most of the time, making 4 or even 5 is assured. On many layouts, we will lose only 2 heart tricks, and we often will be able to set up the long spades to pitch a diamond loser. So I think bidding 4H directly over 2H is a good bid. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is the way to think about this board. When someone opens a Weak-Two and you intend to play in their suit, you know that they have at least 5 HCP, 2 points for the 6-card suit, plus at least 1 point for distribution (no worse than 2 doubletons), giving them a minimum of 8 declarer points. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan has 18 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point for 20 points. Therefore N/S have an 8-card fit and at least 26 points, enough to bid game. There is no real reason to bid Ogust, Feature, or any other bid. You only bid Ogust or Feature if you are not sure whether your side has enough for game. On this hand Stan knows his side has enough for game and an 8-card heart fit.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could make  an argument to bid 2S (assuming that is forcing, I play it is not) because you have such nice spades. However, partner will almost never have 4 spades, so you will usually have at best an 8-card spade fit. And as I said in my comments, the pre-empter's hand has the most value when you play in their suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, I said you should follow LOTT when responding over a Weak-Two. But I have also said that the LOTT does not prevent you from bidding game with even an 8-card fit if your side has at least 26 points, as North knows is the case here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was pretty easy. I have to minimize my heart and club losers. I have 3 hearts, 3 clubs, and probably 1 spade. So, 1H should make at least 1.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding, you should not bid in general with less than 6 points especially when you are short in pard's suit-even a minor. People panic when pard opens 1C and they have a bad hand with a singleton club. But the worse thing  you can do is bid. |
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pard will often have a strong hand. He expects you to have 6 points. What will often happen, if you bid with 3 or 4 points?|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|   You will make things worse. ^^^^Say you bid 1H over 1C which is forcing and now pard bids 2S or 2N. Now you are really in trouble.     So, when you have < 6 and no fit, pass like a shot. It will work out better most of the time. And the opponents will often enter the auction anyway and all will be well.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about why Sandy should bid 1S. Here is the basic theory of balancing (bidding in the pass out seat). If it goes 1x-p-p-?, odds are your side has the majority of the points. So, you are bidding for your side's combined points, not just your hand. If you have fewer points, pard probably has more points but had no good bid.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you should strain to bid. Here Sandy has a 1S bid. In balancing seat that just promises 5 spades, not even 5 good spades. Partner knows you are straining to bid, so should not punish you by overbidding. In fact, on this hand, assuming I don't bid, Ann should pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, Sandy has 1 club loser and 1 diamond loser for sure. So she has to hope one of the major suit finesses work. She has to lose a heart. With the cards distributed as they are, basically it comes down to the spade finesse which works. But that finesse was not needed when at trick 6 they gave her a ruff/stuff in clubs.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, in general new suits by responder are forcing. The only exception is when pard bids 1N. Auctions where pard rebids 1N have different rules.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After a 1N rebid, opener's hand is well defined. Therefore, it is easy to define methods to stop in a suit at the 2-level. The general rule is, except for the artificial NMF bid, all suits at the 2-level are not forcing and are to play. In the next few examples let me illustrate further.|

PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over a 2N rebid, things are different. It is rare that responder would want to correct to play a 3-level partial, and it is quite likely that responder is not sure which suit or NT is best. If opener has 18-19 and responder has at least 6, almost all the time the partnership has enough to be in game. So all 3-level suit bids over 2N are game-forcing and just used to explore different game/slam alternatives.|

Ann  has 16 HCP-2 length points, 2 quality suit points, -1 for dubious @DJ = 19 Starting Points. Then after heart fit, add 2 for singleton, 1 for spade side suit = 22. So slam is a good  possibility.

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.
