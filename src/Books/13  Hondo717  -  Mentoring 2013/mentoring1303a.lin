^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see the 5@D was not a good bid. I should have doubled as they will not do well in 4H. However, generally when you are more distributional you want to play the hand. That is why I bid 5@D. On the other hand the less you are distributional the more you should double. But please always note that the pre-empts make proper bidding very difficult for the opponents.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using strict Bergen's guideline my hand is not an opener though I can open using standard Rule of 20. I usually follow Bergen's hand evaluation and its Rule of 20 guideline. However, I think my great desire to open a hand with 5-card spades overwhelmed my counting judgement. Recently we hand similar cases and they are documented in the recent mentoring session movies. However, let me briefly explain Rule of 20 based on standard and Bergen's guideline.|

^-|ht|c|cs||CP||fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let us look at standard Rule of 20. In standard Rule of 20, you add the number of cards in your two longest suits to hand's HCP. You can open if the total is 20 or more. Let me bring my hand over here.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|
|HT|e|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pSS2389QH2QD27AC29A|at|}|HT|e|AT|^j@2This hand has|hc|sQHQDACA|at| 12 HCP and the two longest suits (5 spades with 3 clubs or diamonds) have 8 cards-12+8 = 20. Therefore, based on standard Rule of 20 it is an opener. Here you use the full value for Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks. 
|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


lc|sQHQDACA|at|
Bergen, however, considers Queens and Jacks (quacks) over valued. Also he subtracts for what he calls dubious doubleton/singletons. On the other hand, he adds for 4+ card suits with three touching honors and when the hand is rich in Aces and tens.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


HT|l|at|^B@2Therefore, when a hand has quacks, is not rich in Aces/Tens or has a few dubious doubleton/singletons may not be an opener according to Bergen while it may be an opener in standard Rule of 20. Let me explain further.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


at|

Bergen's Rule of 20 is the sum of two longest suits and his ^*Iadjusted HCP^*N. The ^*Iadjusted HCP^*N is the Starting Points less Length Points. Starting Points which is the value of the hand before any bidding has the following five parts.|

^-|ht|c|cs||CP||fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason you leave out the suit length part of Starting Points, when calculating adjusted HCP for the Rule of 20, is as follows. The Rule of 20 has 2 parts -- HCP and the length of your 2 longest suits. Adjusted HCP take care of the HCP part of the Rule of 20. The length of your 2 longest suits part already takes into account length points, so to include that when calculating the HCP part of the Rule of 20 would be double counting. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am in a difficult position. I have a weak opener which includes the HQ that may not be of much value. The problem is that Dave could have a good hand with a heart stack and could not double because that is a negative double.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all I could make the hand had I planned it more carefully and taken the opening lead by @DK. Now as far as the bid by Dave because Dave has 4 hearts, some might consider passing for penalty. But that has a lot of downside, especially with IMP scoring. If they make 2H doubled, and they easily could, they would win a lot of imps. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They are not vulnerable, so unless they go down 2, even + 100 is not a good score. Since Dave has 2 spades,  I think 2S is his best choice. Only if they were vulnerable and we were playing match points I would consider passing with Dave's hand. That is because the upside is if they go down 1 doubled and vulnerable, we would get +200, which is better than us making a partial, and has the potential to be close to a top board.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other choice of mine at first was 2N. However, he does not have enough point for that bid and finally 2S should be the best choice. One of the kibs told me about Rule of 9 which Dave can use as a guide in whether to pass or bid on after my reopening double. I am not in favor of too many Rules but there will be a short explanation of the rule at the end of the movie.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the play. Now the bidding. This was a case where I would have bid both E and W differently, but we would have ended up in the same place. Stan should overcall 1D. He has a very nice suit, and plenty of points for a 1-level overcall. Then Sandy would raise diamonds.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the bidding as it went, I would not double with Sandy's hand. I know I have said when they have a fit and you should not let the opponents play at the 2-level. But Sandy does not know we have a fit. In fact, given her heart length, I would suspect a misfit is quite possible. It happened to work out because Stan did not make the 1D overcall.|

PG| ***** 102 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play the answer is yes, although rarely. Suppose Anns's distribution was 3 small spades, 1 heart, 4 diamonds, and 5 clubs or even 2-2 in the majors. Then her best rebid is 2C. Some experts play that 2C rebid promises 6, but I think that makes many hands difficult to bid. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These are the same folks who with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds open 1D and rebid 2C. If you do that then pard will never know your distribution in the minors. For us LOTT advocates that is a big disadvantage. Some people will rebid 1N as the default bid. I think that is dangerous without some spade points. I play that 2@C rebid only promises 5 and an unbalanced hand not suitable to bid 1N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people might pass with my hand and they might even be right. However, that has 2 problems. One is we might miss a 5-3 heart fit and 2 is we might make 3N anyway. When deciding whether or not to stretch, decide based on risk/reward. If the reward is high, as on this hand, and the risk is relatively small, then stretch. In general I hate passing a 2N rebid. Its only right in IMPs if we make exactly 2N. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see my gamble paid off. Ann did well to make the hand, but let me suggest a slight improvement. She should realize there are limited  dummy entries. It is likely Stan, who is leading from long diamonds, has the @DK. So, she should play the @DJ. If that wins that is an extra entry to the board. She can then take the club finesse. Even if that loses, she still has diamonds under control with the @DAQ in her hand. So, if Stan had the CQ, he could not safely lead diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I think you should pre-empt a lot, they are particularly effective in 2 circumstances:|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
a) In 3rd seat. This is because given there are 2 passes, it is more likely that 4th seat has an opener when 3rd hand is weak as well. So, the pre-empt makes it much harder for 4th hand to bid accurately.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
b) At favorable vulnerability (your side not vul, their side vulnerable). This is because they get more points for bidding game and you want to make it as difficult as possible for them to find their best game. Even if you are doubled, undertricks are a lot less expensive non-vulnerable than vulnerable. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a few more comments. I would overcall 3D with Stan's hand. It is quite possible it is their hand, and if Stan passes, it may be difficult for Ann to balance, especially since she is a passed hand. It is ok to overcall over a pre-empt with an opening hand and nice 5-card suit. |
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to whether Ann should double or not I think she has a particularly good double given she is a passed hand. She can't have an opener so partner will not play her for too much. Also, with a singleton club, it is very possible Stan has good clubs and will pass the double. |

Yes, some experts use the Rule of 9  ^*g:ruleof9::Hand Evaluation, (LINK  -  Rule of 9)^*n.  However many experts dislike "Rules" in general and rely on experience. They go by the length and strength in the overcall suit and lack of support for partner.|

However, Rule of 9 can assist less experienced partner in arriving at the best action when forced to respond. The responder (North here) adds:

a. the level of the contract
b. the number of cards held in the suit of the opponent and 
c. the number of honors held in the suit of the opponent (this includes the 10).|

1. If the sum is |CP|8|AT|9 or more|CP||AT|, then the partner, North, should pass for penalty.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.
