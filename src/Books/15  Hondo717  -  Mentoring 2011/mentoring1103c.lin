^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok, let's talk mostly about the bidding. Jackie bid 1N forcing in preparation for making a 3 card limit raise in spades. Using 2/1 with forcing NT, the way you show 10-12 with 3 card support is to bid 1N and then jump in opener's major. So, Jackie's 3S bid was ok as far as it goes. However, once Ally bids 2H, Jackie should probably reconsider her bid. She now knows they have at least a nine-card heart fit maybe even more. Therefore, Jackie should probably bid 3H, and might even consider 4 hearts due to the double fit. As it turns out, if I lead a minor suit, 4H or 4S does not make. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But had Ally been 3-1 in the minors, or I lead a major suit, the hand makes as it did. It is hard for me to figure out to lead a minor as it turns out since I hold both minor suit Aces. So, my choice would be 4H with Jackie's hand, although I would not fault 3H.|

pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I considered bidding 2D over 1S but did not feel my suit was strong enough. If you changed my hand around slightly, say xx Jx Axxx AJ109x then I bid 2 clubs, because I definitely have a great club suit, and want a club lead. But since my 5 card suit was weakish, I decided to be more conservative.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|I picked this simple board for its personal teaching values. In this board, among several, Howard discusses three important errors which I along with many others habitually commit. One is letting the opponents play in one level. Making a Takeout Double with an inappropriate hand is the other. And the third is leading away from the Ace in a suit contract.|

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let us talk about the bidding. In general, if you let the opponents play at the one level, you are due for a bad result, or average at best. So, Jackie should strain to make some bid. Unfortunately she has no good bid. You can make a balancing double with less than an opening hand, and even only 3 hearts, if you are stuck. But with a doubleton heart, and it very likely I will bid hearts, I would not double. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, a 1NT bid would show 11-14 in balancing seat, and some spade cards. If Jackie had Jxx of spades and 11 points (for example add the CQ to her hand), then 1N would be okay. However, with only 9 points and dubious spade values 1N is a bit of a stretch.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| That leaves either 2D or pass. 2D obviously shows 5 diamonds. That is probably what I would choose, but pass is reasonable as well. And if allowed to play 2D, it turns out we lose 2 hearts, a spade and and 2 spade ruffs, so we probably barely make 2. But they also can make 3H probably, and they might get there, so pass worked out okay. However, I would be very unhappy passing with the north hand.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Someone asked me why, with an opening hand, I did not make a takeout double. It is more important you have the correct distribution for a takeout double than an opening hand. A takeout double shows the other 3 suits typically, and shortness in the suit bid. I have length in Ally's spade suit (which often indicates a misfit hand) and shortness in clubs.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| So, if I double and partner bids 2C or maybe even 3C, I will not be happy. Additionally, a takeout double almost always shows 4 cards in the other major, and I have 3 bad hearts. That is why I did not feel my hand was suitable for a takeout double. There are some players who feel all a takeout double shows is an opening hand. But no expert feels that way.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to my lead. First of all, as most of you know, you should not lead away from an Ace in a suit contract. And leading an unprotected Ace is rarely right and should be avoided as well--an "unprotected Ace" is A without the King. If you never again lead an unprotected Ace, you will come out way ahead in the long run. Yes, there are some hands where it works out. But there are many more hands where it works out badly. The reason being that an Ace is best used to capture an opponents honor, and if you lead an unprotected Ace you are only capturing low cards from the opponents.|

gptravel: How about leading a trump?|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A trump is a possibility, but with my holding it is quite possible I give away a trick. So, I decided to lead a heart.|

PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhoward: ^*N|cp||at|From 3 small, there are 3 schools of thought as to what to lead. Let me tell you the 2 popular approaches first.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One is lead count, e.g lead low from 3 regardless of whether or not you have an honor. The advantage of that is, if you play it, partner knows when you lead high low you have a doubleton. The disadvantage is that partner does not know whether or not you have an honor in the suit. What is more popular on BBO is "top of nothing" from 3. If you lead a high card in an unbid suit, you are simply denying an honor. That is the advantage, the disadvantage is partner cannot differentiate between a doubleton and 3. Experts tend to prefer leading low from 3 small. But on BBO, most people prefer leading top of nothing. That is why I led the 10.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am neutral as to which one to prefer (although I personally play low from 3 small). The other approach is known as "MUD" which stands for "middle up down" which I do not care for. With that approach you lead middle (the @H6 in this case), then play up (the @H10) and then down. I think MUD is by far the worst of the 3 choices. Partner often can tell neither how many you have or whether or not you have an honor. My recommendation is pick either top of nothing or low and stick with it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good Ann. You end played dummy, guaranteeing another diamond trick for yourself. Your bidding was fine Marge. Unfortunately Ann had 4 of your trump suit. Ginny played it reasonably well, although I probably would have drawn another trump first. Ginny had 2 heart losers, 2 diamond losers and a spade loser. One of those losers disappear on the @CK. So, the question is how to get rid of the other loser. Probably the best way is to pitch a spade on the club, and hope spades are 3-3 so you can also pitch a diamond. Because of the 4-1 trump split, you cannot make the hand no matter what you do.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me go over Texas vs Regular transfers. Many people play "Texas Transfer", which means, if partner opens 1N, and you have a six card major and game going points you transfer at the 4 level rather than the 2 level. So, 1N-P-4D is a transfer to hearts and 1N-P-4H is a transfer to spades. I see no particular advantage to playing that unless you get very sophisticated although I see no reason not to play it either. I often ask my students, "What is the difference between this auction 1N-2H-2S-4S and 1N-4H-4S?"|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't know the answer to that question, then there is no reason to play Texas Transfer.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT|
Kib: According to Susan Doty (one of BIL teachers ), you bid Texas when you are only interested in playing game and slam is not possible. On the other hand regular transfer keeps the door open to explore for slam.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, that is exactly right. The auction 1N-2H-2S-4S is a mild slam  But most people don't know that. And the point I was trying to make is, if you did not know the answer to that question (and most people do not) then there is no reason for you to play Texas Transfer.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let me discuss my bid. I have to count my Bergen Declarer Points. I have 12 HCP, 1 for a quality suit, 1 for the heart length, 1 for 2 doubletons, and 1 for my 4-card diamond suit giving me 16 Declarer Points. Normally you might say the partnership has at least 25 so I should bid game. However, with Bergen method we need 26 combined points and I have some minuses that Bergen method does not take fully into account.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My @SK may not be worth anything given the spade bid on my left. And my hand is flat, no singletons or voids. So, I would be cautious bidding 4@H. I would most likely bid 3@D as a Help Suit Game Try, and Marge, since she has a minimum limit raise and bad diamonds should correct to 3@H. With that auction we do lose 1C, 2 spades and a diamond.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok, let's see where we stand. I have lost 3 tricks, and can only afford to lose one more. On the surface, it appears I only have one diamond loser. But I have to be careful. In order to avoid any diamond losers. I have to trump 2 diamonds in dummy. If trumps are 3-1 and I draw all of them, I will only have 1 trump left in dummy to ruff a diamond. But, if I delay drawing trumps, I risk getting over ruffed in diamonds. The defenders have 7 diamonds between them, and even if they split 4-3, one defender will be out on the 4th round of diamonds.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If trumps are 2-2, not likely but very possible, then there is no problem. However, my diamond spots give me another alternative. If I take 2 diamond finesses, and East has at least one diamond honor, I need only ruff 1 diamond loser, as I can take care of the other diamond loser using the finesse. What I am going to do is combine the chances of a 2-2 break, in which case I do not need to take 2 diamond finesses, with the chance of 2 diamond finesses if trumps break 3-1. This gives me a very high percentage to make the contract.|

^-|CP||fp||at|^B@2Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a short review of Help Suit Game Try.  |

Kib: Howard would you please explain the Help Suit Game Try (HSGT) further. |
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Help suit game tries occur when you would like to try for game, based on specific cards in partner's hand rather than just how many points he has. Often you can make game with fewer than 25 HCP between the two hands if the hands "fit" together well. "Fitting" together well often means that both hands have points in the same suits. |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


at|

For example, if you have Q9x opposite K10x, that is much better than Q9x opposite xxx. In the first case, the Q is actually worth something, whereas in the second case, the holding is almost equivalent to xxx.|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


at|

The idea behind a help suit game try (HSGT) is to discover such a fit. It usually occurs when partner has raised your suit. If he has close to the upper end of the range, or a good fit, you would like to be in game.  |
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


at|

Kib: would you please give and example. |
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


at|

As a common example, assume the bidding has gone 1@H by you, 2@H by partner, and you have around 16 or 17 points. If partner has 8 or 9 (the top of the range for 2@H), you certainly would like to be in game. So, one thing you could do is simply bid 3@H, asking partner to bid 4@H with 8 or 9. |
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


at|

However, another thing you could do is bid another suit where you have some broken high cards (such as the aforementioned K10x). This is a help suit game try. It tells partner to bid 4 if he has a good 8 or 9, or, if he has some "help" (high cards) in the suit mentioned, even if he has a bit less in the way of points. Partner also has some flexibility. If he is not sure whether to bid 3 or 4, he can bid another suit, which is also a help suit game try, and you can then decide based on this new information whether to bid 3 or 4 (or possibly 3NT). |

pg| ***** 115 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner has neither a maximum nor help for your suit, he should decline your game try. He does this by simply returning to the original suit. So, for example, if the auction goes 1H-P-2H-P-3C-P, if partner bids 3H, he is declining your game try of 3C. If he bids 4H, he has accepted your game try.|

at| As you can see on a heart lead partnership loses three hearts and @DA. It is down one in spite of 26 points. The reason being that the honors in both hands are not working together--the @DKQ are wasted. |

^B@2^*Bhoward: ^*N|cp||at|As you can se the South hand is identical and the North has the same number of points. However, now the suits in both hands are working together. 4S contract is secure. So, how all this information is related to HSGT?|

at|^c@2^Y@3This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I like to have a record representing the sessions as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it. The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. 

Please, notes unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|AT| double dummy|CP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some boards are presented in a closed format. To open any hand click that seat. Another click opens all hands. ^*BThe links in this file are clickable^*N. Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. |
