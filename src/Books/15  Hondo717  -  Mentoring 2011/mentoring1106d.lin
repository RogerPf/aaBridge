^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

PG| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play a cue bid, showing a limit raise can be done with 3 card support, then Eileen's bid is good. I personally prefer to play that it shows 4 card support, as that helps me decide whether or not to bid game. However, most play that the cue bid only shows 3 card support. So, Eileen made a mainstream bid. What I play with some partners is that both a cue bid and 2N show a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lower of the 2 bids (CUE BID here) shows the 3 card raise, the higher (2NT) shows a 4 card raise. So, if we played that, 2C in this deal shows a 3-card limit raise and 2N shows a 4-card limit raise. However, then you give up 2NT as a natural bid. You have to decide whether that approach is worth it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my Declarer Points. 9 HCP. -1 for Jx of hearts, plus 2 length points, plus 2 for singleton, and plus  1 for 4+ diamonds = 13 Declarer point, It not enough for game. So, 2S is appropriate.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's talk about what Ann might do. Although she only has 4 HCP, she actually has a pretty good hand on this auction. She has a six card suit and a singleton in our suit. So, although pass is certainly acceptable, she might consider 3H. She cannot have a strong hand. She must just be competing. Remember, she did not bid 2H over 1S, so she cant have 10 points. A negative double followed by a suit shows a weakish hand with a long suit, because with a strong hand and long suit you bid the suit immediately. That is a good thing to remember in competitive auctions.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, Kim we just discussed a similar hand. What does 3H show in a competitive auction as opposed to a cue bid? I am sure you know that in a competitive auction 3H is weak, promising 4+ hearts support and less than a limit raise. So, 3H is not the best bid with your hand. Let us undo the bid.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3D is certainly acceptable. If you played the system I talked about the previous hand, it works slightly differently, but the same idea. Between the cue bid and 2N, the cheaper bid shows 3 card support, the higher bid shows 4 card support. Playing my system, Kim would bid 2N to show a 3 card limit raise. However, as I said, most on BBO play 3D only promises 3 card support.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to play. When planning the hand, you need to count your winners. Ann can only count 9 winners, 2 clubs, 5 hearts in her hand and 2 club ruffs.She needs another trick. Her best bet is to hope she can set up a spade. An alternative line is to start spades at trick 2, hoping to set up 2 spade tricks. That way she scores 2 spades, 5 hearts, 1 club ruff, and 2 clubs for 10 tricks. There is a danger we get a spade ruff but she has to hope that does not happen.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should I have opened 1NT? Normally I would say yes and I would not criticize anyone who did. But, because my spade suit was a quality suit, I only had 15, including a dubious @DJ, and I had 2 suits unstopped, I thought 1S was slightly better. If I had one more point, say even @HJ, I would have opened 1N. In general. however, as most of you know, I strongly advocate opening 1N with 15-17 balanced, even with a 5 card major.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me talk about why I prefer to lead King from Ace-King in the middle of the hand, even though you lead A from AK on opening lead. In general, on opening lead, it is rare to lead unprotected Aces, so Ace is usually from Ace-King. However, in the middle of the hand sometimes the best defense might be to lead an unprotected Ace. For example, if you can see that there are no honors in front of your Ace, it is probably not costing anything. Therefore, in the middle of the hand, sometimes A is not from AK. But, if you lead the K, and A is not in dummy, and declarer does not take the A, it is pretty clear you have it. So, King from Ace-King is less ambiguous in the middle of the hand than Ace from Ace-King.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I need to carefully review a portion of how to show support for partner when the right hand opponent makes a NATURAL overcall. To do so, first let me quote from one of the lessons by Susan Doty, BBO nickname "sdoty" on the issue on September 2007:|

I would be only dealing with the second part--Hands with INVITATIONAL OR BETTER strength. The intervening bid is either a suit overcall (1H-1S-?) or a double (1S-double-?).  And again I will look at the suit overcall situation. Let us look at a few examples first. In all you are sitting North.|

Let us repeat. You have an Invitational hand and 3+ card support. So, the correct bid is 3H--cuebid. Please note the 3+ in the explanation box. Be patient. I will get there. However, I get paid by frame so I have to stretch it as long as I can:).|

You have an Invitational hand and 3+ card support. So the correct bid is 3H--cuebid. However, your hand this time has 4-card support with the same number HCP. Further, we all know that the extra trump card goes a long way to set the final auction. So, how can you tell your partner that last hand you had only 3-card support and this time you have four. Next, we will see Howard's teaching on this particular issue. let us undo a few of the bids.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer that the cue shows 4-card support as in this hand. I consider knowing that we have have a 9-card fit important information. It allows me to more accurately apply the Law of Total Tricks, and bid close games. My general rule when bidding close games is to bid close games with a 9-card fit and not bid close games with an 8-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the other variation (we will call it variation II), there are 2 ways to show a limit raises with three and four card support--the cheaper of cue bid or 2N. The cheaper of the cue bid and 2N shows the 3-card limit raise; the higher bid shows the 4-card limit raise. For example in this example the bid should be 3H|MB|3h|at| the higher of 2NT and 3H showing four card support.|
