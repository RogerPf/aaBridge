qx|P1|HT|d|CS||FP||CP||AT|^b@2^z@3The three Musketeers Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who have been members of "Musketeers of the Guard" with solid performance records were not so happy with their last practice session with Monsieur de Tréville. In particular they had problem protecting themselves from the many undoes (a legendary quick slash by Monsieur de Tréville's sword). Therefore, they requested to be given another opportunity to prove their mettle and to improve their standings.

What you will view next is the story of their experiences at the practice session on October 25, 2011. Due to time constraint we are bringing you only four of the six sessions. Those are listed below in blue hyperlinks. Click your choice of the session--1 through 4--to view it. |TU|Y|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|I think Porthos has a fine 2D bid. Some people play you should not open a weak 2 with an outside 4 card major. I personally think that is a foolish restriction. However, if you prefer to play that way, you have to pass with Porthos's hand.|

^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|If you never open a weak 2 with a 3+ card major, then you might as well not play weak 2's :) as you will never open 1. There is some reason for not opening with a 4 card major, but there are few hands with a 6 card suit that do not contain a 3 card major.|

^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|2N by Joan, though she does have the point count 15-18, lacks one key ingredient obviously which is a diamond stopper. So,Joan must make a takeout double, particularly with 4-4 in the majors. If Bonnie bids clubs, so be it, but KJ doubleton is certainly not terrible and Bonnie will strain to bid a major.|

^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|I discussed the 2D and 2N. It was lucky Bonnie chose to transfer because obviously 2N is down off the top. Now, over 2N, systems are still on, so Stayman and transfers (just as West bid) are on. East, with 4 spades could consider bidding 4 spades with 4 card support, although that is a bit aggressive.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie does have a problem over 3S. She could pass, because east might only have 15 or 16 and not good spades or she could choose to bid on. With only 5 spades, I would probably choose to bid 3N with the West hand, in case partner has, for example, long clubs and only 2 card spade support. Fortunately on this hand, East would correct to 4S.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play. Porthos made an excellent play of overtaking my DQ as I could easily have a singleton and, in fact, I did. Another diamond back is very clear. First and most important, I have a doubleton at most, based on the lead, so East has at least one more. It is important, after opening lead, to try and count out how many of the led suit declarer has. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Often it is pretty easy, as on this hand. The basic technique is to count the number of cards in the North hand and dummy. On this hand that comes to 9. Therefore, between South and East there are 4. South, based on the lead has 1 or 2. Therefore, East has 2 or 3 and North is sure of at least 2 diamond tricks. 4S is down 1 if diamonds are continued.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|The preferred auction is 2D-x-P-2S, 3S is a tad aggressive. They may end up in 4S anyway, as East could decide to raise 2S to 3.|

^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. What should Spencer bid over 1C? 2C, if playing inverted is fine, but 1D takes up less room. I always prefer, with an opening hand, to keep the bidding lower when possible. But those who chose to bid 2C, that is ok. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Now, Joan was inconsistent on this hand. She has a pretty clear 1S bid with her hand. But if she chooses to pass, then she should not come in any more. Basically, by passing the first time and coming in the second time, she has made it easy on the opponent. We now have had a couple of rounds of bidding to exchange information, and it is possible she could even get doubled.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


AT|
Aramis: Yes, I should have overcalled immediately.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|The right thing is to try and get in the bidding as early as you can. It is the most disruptive to the opponent. For example, on this hand, I have no good bid over 1S an have to pass. Further, Bonnie should raise 1S to 3S with the known 9 card fit. Then, by the time bidding gets back to North, we have to guess what to do at the 4 level.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's take the auction as it went. North's 2C is a big under bid. Remember, as responder you are generally "captain" of the auction, and must direct the partnership. North has an opening hand, and, assuming we have a spade stopper, the most likely contract is 3NT. Therefore, North must make some sort of forcing bid. Some people play 3C is forcing. If you play the 4th suit forcing convention, then 3C is only invitational.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer 4th suit forcing myself. So assuming you play 4sf to game, what should Porthos bid?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
Porthos: For 4SF, I have to bid 2S.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Correct. This is the one problem auction where you have to agree. As Spencer said, many people play 1S over 1H is natural and not a game force. It is, however, a one round force, so I cannot pass. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|But if you play 1S is natural and not 4sf, then North, indeed, has to bid 2S. That is the way many people play. I don't see where playing 1S as 4th suit forcing gets you into any trouble. But if you prefer playing 1S as not 4sf and 2 spades as 4th suit forcing, that is fine. It just takes up more room. In any case, Spencer should bid either 1S or 2S depending on our agreement, as 4th suit forcing.|

Aramis: What is the proper bidding on that hand Howard? |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |

^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done. North played that hand in a very reasonable manner. She saw 9 tricks and took them. And whenever you make your contract, particularly playing IMPs, that is a good thing. Having said that, she might duck the first heart because there is no danger of going down. And if east plays another heart, north will take 2 heart tricks. In fact any lead but a diamond by East is likely to help declarer.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMonsieur de Treville: ^*N|cp||at|Although as I said, taking your 9 tricks is fine this hand does illustrate that the concept of "losing your losers" early, is sometimes helpful. One question I got is, would I make a negative double with the North hand. That has merit in that it shows spades, and is probably what I would have done. But by bidding 3D, Bonnie is showing a stronger hand, and if I bid 3S she can bid 4.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3A young reader asks, What causes stupid mental lapses and how can I avoid them? I mean things like counting a suit as 5-4-3-2 around the table, or carelessly opening 1NT (12-14), when holding 16 HCP. How do the experts avoid such lapses? |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


AT|

We have all been there, or at least I have. On one particularly embarrassing occasion, my partner opened 2D and I passed his presumed weak two bid. Unfortunately, in our methods 2D showed a balanced 19-20 HCP, so we missed an ice-cold game. Deeply humiliated, on the next board I glanced at my hand and quickly opened 1S. After partner had raised me to 4S, I glanced down again to see that my five-card major was actually hearts! Now it is one thing to have a club in with your spades, but it is quite another to confuse spades and hearts! At the time, I missed the strange "coincidence" that my second lapse occurred while I was profoundly distressed from the first one. |
PG| ***** 97 ***** |

So how do the experts avoid such lapses? They don't. At least they don't do it always. I have seen world famous players revoke, miscount suits, pull the wrong card, attempt to play a hand at NT only to realize after a ruff that they were playing in a suit, etc. However ordinary players certainly do lapse more often. The experts control their lapses because they understand three rules: |

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3I recently played in the ACBL's national tournament. In the evening sessions the number of blunders went up exponentially across the field. It was not hard to see why--players were so tired they were collapsing on couches during breaks or resting their eyes at the table. Towards the end of an evening session, I came to Andrew Robson's table. Andrew is one of the game's great and highly respected players, but tonight he was exhausted. I could see the deep circles around his eyes, and he was literally having trouble keeping his eyes open.|

But I noticed something else. Andrew would not allow the fatigue to make him careless. He was playing extremely slowly taking extra time over even simple decisions, clearly going over the count again and again until he was sure of his play. Andrew may only have played 80% of his best game but at least it was not 50% which is what would have happened had he given in to the fatigue. I learned a valuable lesson that day.|

Try to get adequate rest before a game but when you can not, here are some guidelines to avoid blunders: 
1. Pay attention to signs of your own fatigue. A key sign is playing poorly. If you blow a hand you ordinarily make, ask yourself if you are tired. If you are, address the problem immediately. 
2. Drink a cup of coffee, or run around the hotel a couple of times. 
3. Slow down. Double and triple check the count before making a play. 
4. Be kind to yourself. Be satisfied with getting 90% of your best game. Don't expect perfection. 
5. Reinforce your will to succeed. Though your capabilities are compromised, you can still play the best game possible under the circumstances. |

{|ia|,,,pp1cdrpp1d1nppp|at|}|HT|i|AT|^m@2^*Z@3The opening lead was made, and opener surprised me by tabling a balanced 17 HCP dummy. Given that the responder had shown 10+ HCP, passing 1NT seemed a dim view of prospects. After the hand, opener explained earnestly that he had considered inviting, but, "With 14 points I was afraid to." (!) Since the limit of the hand was eight tricks, I could only mutter under my breath about this fix!|

ht|q|AT|^b@2On a serious note, counting mistakes are a part of the learning process. The best way to avoid them is to rehearse your counting skills until they are automatic. |

Suggestions:

1. Hand Patterns*
Spend five minutes a day mentally repeating hand patterns 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, 4-4-4-1, 5-3-3-2, 5-4-2-2, 5-4-3-1, etc. After a week, these should begin to be so automatic that you can repeat all the possible hand patterns at high speed without conscious thought.

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@32. Counting High Card Points
Count high cards from left to right, keeping a running total. Then count again, counting from right to left. Or count by pairing up lower honors into units of 4 HCP (KJ, QQ) then adding four for each ace, four for each pair and finally counting any unpaired lower honors. It does not really matter. Just count multiple times using different approaches to catch errors. |

3. Placing unseen high cards
When an opponent has shown a 3-point range, for example by opening 1NT, assume he has the middle of his range and then subtract points from 40. For example, suppose you hold 11, dummy holds 8 and opener opened 1NT (12-14). 
40-11 = 29
29-8=21
21-13 = 8 for partner +/- 1
Then picture what 8 HCP looks like. E.g., two aces, two kings and a queen, etc. Now begin to place those high cards based on the cards you see and the play. Rehearse this process, until it is second nature. |

HT|e|va|4|cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|at|^-{        Handling Emotion         }
^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Suppose your opening lead blows a trick. What is worse, your &%$## partner's silly bid caused you to make the unsuccessful lead. While declarer ponders what to do, you silently fume. After several seconds Declarer unexpectedly leads a small card toward dummy. Holding the ace of the suit, you are caught flat-footed. As seconds tick by, your irritation grows as you realize you have given away the location of the ace. In this frustrated state, you are much more likely to blow a second trick than if you had calmly prepared for opener's lead while declarer was thinking. Blunders and emotional distress often go hand-in-hand. Strong emotions interfere with your thinking process, and playing bridge provokes many of them. At various times, I have felt elation, fear, anxiety, worry, anger, humiliation, guilt, and embarrassment while playing. It is impossible to eliminate these feelings, but you can make them come up less often and minimize their effect when they do.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |

Before you play, acknowledge that strong emotions impair your decision-making and accept that sometimes you have those feelings. When a strong feeling occurs, acknowledge it and then take time to process it. If you are angry, be angry. Then take a deep breath, picture a virgin tropical beach in your mind (or whatever you do to get over feeling angry). Return to the bridge decision only after returning to a calm mental state. |

Here are some habits to improve your ability to manage emotion. 

1. Remove triggers for strong emotions:
Do not keep a private score. The act of writing down numbers like -1400 and +210 keeps that bad sacrifice and the grand you played in partscore in the fore of your mind. Don't keep score and your mind will let the disasters go more quickly. Save the postmortems for after the session. Rehashing bad results, or worse, trading blame with partner only produces more negative feelings. Give obnoxious opponents the silent treatment. If the silent treatment, does not work, try the "Director!" treatment. Arguing will not improve focus. |

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@32. Use mental tricks to restore your equilibrium after a strong emotion:
A. Take several deep breaths.
B. Count to ten.
C. Imagine a place that reminds you of happy feelings.
D. Repeat a calming phrase over and over.|

3. Process your emotion separately from playing cards.
While you are having your feelings, think about the emotions not the hand. If find yourself playing while upset, take a short mental break, and restore your optimal emotional state before returning to the hand. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |

4. Never criticize yourself.
When you make mistakes, substitute a simple phrase like, "I don't make mistakes; I only run out of time," for the self-critical words. The less you self-criticize, the more relaxed you will become during competition and with relaxation comes mastery. |

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
