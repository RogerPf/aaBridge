^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. Anna probably has a more descriptive bid than 2N. That is 2H which is a reverse. That way she shows both her shape (5+ clubs and 4 hearts) and points (16+). As it turns out we end up in 3N anyway. Let me briefly go over the way to respond to the 3D new minor forcing bid. My 3D bid guarantees that I have 5 spades. I may or may not have 4 hearts. The reason being with 4 hearts and 4 spades I would have bid 1H, so I must have 5 spades in order to do new minor forcing.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, notice that Anna's 2N bid, although not best with her hand, does not deny 4 hearts (for example were she 2-4-3-4) she has a clear 2N bid. So, remember the auction 1 minor - 1H or 1S - 2N does not deny a 4 card major. It simply shows a balanced 18-19.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, to responses over new minor forcing. My 3D bid is asking Anna if she has 4 hearts or 3 spades. If she has both she should bid 3H. If I then bid 3N, she knows I must have 5 spades and not 4 hearts, so with both she would then correct to 4 spades. If she doesn't bid 3H first, we could miss our 4-4 heart fit.|

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. If Anna counts her tricks she can figure out how to make 3N. She can count 3 diamonds for sure. And unless clubs break badly (4-1 with no singleton honor) she can count 4 club tricks once she loses a club. That gives her 7 sure tricks. Then, knocking out the HA gives her 2 heart tricks for 9 total tricks. So, the correct play is to win the D, play the CA. Whether or not an honor appears, she should then duck a club. Win the diamond return, and run the clubs, preserving a diamond entry in her hand. Then play hearts for 9 tricks.|

sk|E|pc|S6|lb|*cWhat card should be played from the dummy?^^st^S23T^|pc|S2|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming I am leading 4th best, the rule of 11 applies. So, 11 - 6 (the card I led) means there are 5 higher than the six between the other 3 hands. Since BJ can see 4 cards higher than the 6 (the @SKQ10 and 8) then Anna only has only one higher. If it is the Jack then low is right. If it is the Ace it doesn't matter. But if it is the 9 or 7 it does matter. So since of the 4 possible cards Anna could have (A, J, 9, and 7) only if she has the J is it right to play low. BJ should play high as that rates to work better.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a very complicated analysis, but I thought it was interesting and worth mentioning. Not saying BJ should see it, but that is how experts figure out what card to play.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a good illustration of using the Law of Total Tricks. Dorothy has a 4S bid using the law, since we have a 10 card fit. And it is safe to bid to the 4 level with a 10 card fit, especially at this vulnerability. That way we talk them into 5 clubs down 1. And we might even make 4 spades although not if they lead trumps. Anyway, you should always obey the law as Marty Bergen says, "It is more accurate than even an expert's judgement." And I totally agree.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, this is a hand where if I happen to lead a club, we beat it, assuming I figure out my partner has a singleton.

PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss Anna's bid. 4H is certainly fine. However, lets count her Dummy Points. She has 10 Starting Points--9 HCP, -1 for SQ singleton, 2 length points. Then once hearts are bid, add 3 for singleton (4+ card support) and 1 for doubleton which gives her 14 total Dummy Points. Obviously she cannot bid Jacoby 2N. However, if playing Bergen Raises, Anna has a very good bid. She can bid 3D (limit raise) (or 3C with reverse Bergen) to at least show she has more than a preemptive 4H bid. And then even if partner bids 3H, she will bid 4H.|

^-{ THE RULE OF ELEVEN }
^-|
cp||fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Assuming that Partner's low-card lead is the fourth best of his suit you can apply what is known as the "Rule of Eleven," which has been in use by card players since the days of Whist. The rule gets its name from its arithmetical operation, which is simply this: if you deduct from 11 the number of pips or spots on the card led, the remainder is the number of cards higher than the card led which are held by yourself, Dummy, and Declarer together. That is, if Partner leads a five-spot, you deduct 5 from 11, and you know that only 6 cards higher than the five-spot are to be found outside the leader's hand. The following diagram shows how the rule works: |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||
qx||st||sk|W|SK|N|SK|E|md|1SJ,S6,SQT4,SK95|sv||MB|1NTPPP|PC|S6|nt|^B@2 
You are East, and your partner leads the spade six. You deduct 6 from 11, which tells you that five cards higher than the six are held by North, South and East. Of these five higher cards, you yourself (East) hold two, and Dummy (North) holds two more. That means that you know the location of four of the five cards outstanding higher than the card led (King, Queen, Ten, and nine). Where is the other one? It has to be in the Declarer's hand. In other words, of all the cards higher than the six which you cannot see, the Declarer holds but one, and Partner holds the rest (you know, of course, that if Partner's lead is fourth best, he must hold three cards higher than his lead).|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^B@2
The value of this formula--the Rule of Eleven--now becomes apparent.  With the particular distribution of spades in the diagram you know that the Ace, Jack, eight, and seven of spades are missing. If you had no way of telling where any of these might be, you would be up a tree to choose your play if Declarer plays the four from Dummy. But since you know that Declarer holds only one of these missing higher cards, you can play with much more confidence.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^B@2
You thus see how the Rule of Eleven works. It is mathematically sound, provided Partner's lead is his fourth-best card, which you must usually assume unless or until you have reason to suppose otherwise. The mathematical reasoning underlying the rule is not important.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Having found your first clue as to your Partner's holding in the suit he has led, you are ready to consider your play. It may safely be said that you should follow this rule 99 times out of 100: Whenever Partner's opening lead against no-trump is obviously a plain length lead and your (Third Hand's) highest cards are not in sequence, you should play your highest if the Dummy has no more than three cards of which the highest is the Ten or lower. It is understood that your "highest card" is better than the Ten, of course.|

This may seem rather complicated, but it is really extremely simple. Suppose your Partner leads a card between the two-spot and the six-spot. If the Dummy goes down with a singleton, a doubleton, or a tripleton headed by no card above the Ten, you must play the Ace, King, Queen, or Jack, if you hold it and do not have the card directly below it--no matter what card is played from the Dummy. The following diagram is a simple illustration:|

What have you done? You first applied the Rule of Eleven. You subtracted 4 from 11, which left 7. You can see six cards in your own hand and the Dummy which are higher than the four-spot. You therefore know that the Declarer holds only one card higher than the four, which can be only the Ace, the King, the Jack or the five-spot. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If Declarer has the Ace, you know your Partner holds King-Jack; if Declarer has the King, you know your Partner holds Ace-Jack; if Declarer has the Jack or the five-spot, you know your Partner holds Ace-King. In any one of these events, it is impossible for the Declarer to secure more than 1 trick in hearts if you play your Queen, and he can make 1 trick only if his higher card is the Ace or King--otherwise your play of the Queen will keep him from making any heart tricks at all. It is quite possible that your Partner is leading the fourth-best card from a suit headed by the Ace-King and he may have anywhere from four to six cards in the suit.|

^c@2^Y@3In the rule just given, it was specified that to play your highest card you must not have the card directly below it in rank. There was a reason for this. If you do have two or more high cards of Partner's led suit, and these are in sequence, you should not play the highest card, but the lowest card of the sequence. This is true for any number of cards in unbroken sequence at the top of the led suit. If you hold Ace-King, you play the |cp|8|at|King|cp||at|; if you hold King-Queen, you play the |cp|8|at|Queen|cp||at|; if you hold King-Queen-Jack, you play the |cp|8|at|Jack|cp||at|; if you hold K Q J 10, you play the |cp|8|at|Ten|cp||at|. |

This rule holds true, as a matter of fact, throughout Third Hand's play, even after the first trick. It helps your Partner to read your hand during the later play. In playing Third Hand high, then, you always select the bottom card of a sequence heading the led suit. Put another way, whenever you have cards of equal value so far as taking the trick is concerned, you lead the highest, but play the lowest. We will now explain this principle.|

Why, in leading, should you choose the highest of a sequence, but in playing, the lowest? Perhaps the following diagram will make the reason clear:|

Nothing whatever--beyond those he can see in his own hand and in the Dummy, plus the four that have been played. Anyone may have the Jack of diamonds; anyone may have the Ten. Partner's only high card is the King, now the commanding card of the suit. He will probably lead, therefore, some other suit.|

Now if Declarer had held the Queen, wouldn't he have used it to win that trick, since the King was still outstanding? He certainly would have. Consequently since Declarer did not win with the Queen, your Partner knows that you have the Queen (obviously it is not in the Dummy). He can thus lead another low diamond with the knowledge that you will win the trick and return the suit, enabling him to take 2 more tricks with his King and five-spot.|

This conventional |cp|8|at|play of the bottom card of a sequence is of the utmost importance. Never depart from it|cp||at|. Since your cards in sequence are of equal value, the card you play can make no difference to you, but it makes a vast difference to your Partner--so play the bottom one. This applies to any number of cards, no matter how many cards heading the suit are in sequence. If Partner leads low in a suit of which you hold K Q J 10 9, your proper play is the |cp|8|at|nine|cp||at| spot, which, for trick-taking purposes, is every bit as good as the King. If you hold 9 8 7 3 2 in the suit Partner leads, and your play is to choose your highest card, you play the seven-spot, which ranks equally with the eight and nine.|

^-{          WHO FORMULATED RULE 11          }
^-|
CP||fp||at|^*I
^c@2^Y@3Mr. R. F. Foster, a famous Whist and Bridge authority, claims to have first formulated the rule. Whether he did or not, the rule is so simple that, given the premise of the lead of fourth best, any arithmetician would be likely to derive the formula sooner or later. It is based on the fact that there are 13 cards in the suit of which, since he has led his fourth-best card Partner holds three higher than his lead. Since three cards are accounted for, only 10 cards remain to be considered. 

Of these, only the card led and those ranking below it need be deducted to  determine how many other cards there are higher than it. However, there is no one-spot (the Ace being high), so 1 must be added to compensate for the non-existent lower card (or the same result may be accomplished by subtracting from 10 one less than the number of pips on the card led). Obviously, the number of pips on the card led accounts for its own rank and also the rank of all lower cards, so that to deduct its denomination from 11 gives the answer desired.

The rule may be explained another way. Deduct the denomination of the card led from 14, and you know how many cards in the suit are higher than it. Of these the leader holds three. Subtracting these, you have the same result as though you had deducted the denomination of the card led from 11 in the first place.

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. Now, please click |cp|1|AT|^*GR1, RETURN^*N |CP||AT|to return to your original location.|
