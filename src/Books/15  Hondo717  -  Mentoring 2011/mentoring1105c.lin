^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a pretty straight forward hand. Kia had a standard 1N overcall, with 15 HCP and stoppers in my suit. Further, you should play systems on over the 1N overcall, so, Ann was correct in bidding 2C--Stayman. As to the play, it was fine for Eileen to lead my suit. And, note I played the DK on the first trick, lowest of touching honors as 3rd hand. That is very important, as it lets Eileen know I have the DA once Kia ducks. Correct defensive carding is crucial to beating many contracts. Once I switch to the HK, Eileen should be very happy and therefore signal with a high heart to encourage me to continue the suit. Again, help partner on defense when you can.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia should actually duck 2 hearts, the reasoning is as follows:
We have 8 hearts between us. If they are 4-4, it doesn't matter what Kia does. But if I have 3 and Eileen has 5, as on this hand, then by ducking 2 hearts, when I get in with a diamond, I have no more harts. In general, when ducking, you figure out how many cards the opponents have between them, and duck enough times such that if they are not split evenly, you can prevent an opponent from leading thee suit. An 8-card fit with the opponents, where you are 3-2 is very common and calls for your ducking twice.|

^B@2^*B Movie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Howard's next analysis of how to bid in this hand would be more telling with a closed format. Please bear with me.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand it is likely that Eileen has spades. Why is that? Because they did not jump directly to 4S, so it is less likely they have a 10 card fit. Therefore, Eileen could easily have 4 spades, or occasionally 5. However, if they are small, then I want to play the hand. As the result, I will pass and see what Eileen decides to do.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is known as a "Forcing Pass" and Eileen cannot pass. Since we voluntarily bid game, their 4S should be treated as a sacrifice. Eileen must either bid 5H or double. Letting them play 4S undoubled will not be a good result.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


mb|p|nt||sk|N|lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^x|NT|^B@2
firsty: How do I decide? I have a good hand. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case double is clear, because you have length in their suit and you only have three hearts. We don't have more than 8 or 9 hearts, and they have no more than 9 spades. When deciding when to double, 2 criteria to use are: a) do you have values in their suit, if so tend to double, and b) If short, tend to bid. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ask yourself, how many trumps do I have in our suit. The more you have the more you want to bid. And, the less you have the more you want to double. In this case Eileen only has 3 card support. That means we cannot have that many hearts. So, an expert would say because of the spade length and heart shortness, double is clear.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


mb|d|sk||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is always a guess. It turns out on this hand playing 5H is probably best. But you have to base your decisions on probabilities, and given Eileen's hand, double is pretty clear. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out because diamonds behave we can make 5H, but if they don't we can go down. By the rule of 20 Ann certainly can open 1S. However, I find on marginal hands with a six card major, especially spades, if I have no Ace or King outside spades, tactically I prefer to open 2S. Either is fine. Its just a matter of which you think will be more effective.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine. Let's talk about Kim's 2H Bid. That should show 10 points at least. Sometimes you have to stretch. However, on this hand, Kim has some negatives. Aside from only having 8 HCP she has a weak heart suit. Also her spade King, although well placed, is not likely to fit well with my hand. For those reasons, I think a negative double is slightly better. If the SK were the HK (different hand), then 2H, although still aggressive, is better.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, its not just how many HCP you have, but where they are located that matters. You should upgrade for points in your suits, downgrade for points in the opponents' suits.|

PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, a negative double does not promise both unbid suits, only the unbid major. She might pass 2C. If her hearts were slightly better she could bid 2H, which shows a long suit and less than 10 points. So, a "negative double and correct", unlike a "double and correct" shows a long suit and weak hand.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite the conventional wisdom, a 4-4 fit is not always better than a 5-3 fit even though most teachers teach that 4-4 is better. The reason it is taught is that, if you have both a 4-4 and 5-3, you can throw off on the 5 card suit. And sometimes that will yield an extra trick. However, if trumps break 4-1, which they do almost 1/3 of the time, a 5/3 fit handles the bad break much better. If you are pretty sure both contracts make, unless you are playing match points, where overtricks matter, the 5-3 is usually safer.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That hand was a bit lucky. Kia had a pretty weak opener, with the HQ wasted, and we still made 4 with 19 HCP. That is why Bergen hand evaluation is so good. It really helps you upgrade distributional hands. My 7 HCP hand is worth 14 in spades. It turns out 5H is a good sacrifice, only down 2. If Kim had a singleton spade, I think she should bid 5H, but with Qx of spades, pass is probably better.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Lead was the Ace of hearts, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to end this presentation. |

^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands.  You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course.  You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made.  You may (not always) use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead.  You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other.  You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. Now, please click |cp|1|AT|^*GR1, RETURN^*N |CP||AT|to return to your original location.|
