{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain 1S there. This is an auction where you have 2 ways to show spades. You can either make a negative double or bid 1S. Therefore, if you bid 1S it promises 5+. A negative double shows exactly 4. So, Mei ann should make a negative double. For those of us who like the law of total tricks, that distinction really helps. I will give you an undo.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Notice that Ginny correctly led back her remaining count. Since she had 2 hearts left, she played the higher one first. That gives me count on the hand. Ginny might have started with @HQ9 doubleton, or @HQ9x. But if she led the 3 back, I would assume she started with exactly @HQ3. This way I have some idea what she has.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Mostly I want to discuss the bidding. Marge has a tough problem over the double. Ostensibly, 1N should show a heart stopper. Had I not bid 1H, then 1N would have been ok. But since I bid 1H, I think 2D is a slightly better bid.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Marge can count 5 diamonds 2 clubs and 1 heart for sure. So, I think her best bet is to try the club finesse. It might win, and if it loses she is no worse off. It is better to take some chance to make the contract, than to just concede down 1 to the opponents.|

MarDef: When to do the finesse? I was worried about your running Hearts.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well I could, but the way you played it you just about guaranteed down 1. At least if you take the finesse, you have a chance to make it. On this hand, the finesse loses, so it did not matter, but if Ginny hand the 2CQ, it would have mattered a great deal. In general, count your winners, and try and come up with a plan to make your contract. If the only way involves a risk, take the risk. Better to go down fighting than just concede :).|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Very nice bidding and play on this hand. Only a few minor points. Most important, remember that if partner opens and there is an intervening overcall or double if you have 4 card support, you either make a limit raise (by cue bidding or Jordan 2N over a double), or a preemptive raise to 3. You should not temporize by bidding 2, as partner will never play you for 4 card support. For example, on this hand, since Marge had six, she had an easy 4H bid. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Mei ann had only bid 2H, it might have been harder to find game. By the same token, Ginny should consider bidding 3S. I am not saying it is right, but it should be considered. With the same hand, except for a singleton heart, 3S would be correct. But with her flattish hand, at this vulnerability, pass is probably better. Remember, 4S over 4H is often the right call. But, if responder does not raise spades then I have no chance of finding 4S. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, on this hand, since we are vulnerable and they are not, it is not as likely that 4S is a good bid. But, at equal or favorable vulnerability (we are not vul, they are), 4S is likely to be a good bid either as a sacrifice or making.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|First of all let me explain my 1S bid. There were a lot of private chats going on, and I simply miscounted my points. I have a clear pass. However, because I did open, I caused them to miss game but that was not my intent. Further, 3C was a forcing bid, and Ginny should not pass. They can make 3N. So, Ginny needs to find a bid over 3C.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With Kxx of clubs and King of spades, I would bid 3N, hoping I can take 9 tricks. But, 3D would be okay. However, I don't think quite as good. Ginny definitely does not want to go past 3N. And it is rarely right to play in 5 of a minor rather than 3N. You should really hate to play in 5 of a minor|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|
gimit: I thought partner must have long clubs and not much else because of the bidding--too much thinking.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well if partner has long clubs, you can take six clubs a spade and a diamond for sure and hopefully another trick somewhere, maybe the diamond finesse. So, 3N seems like an excellent gamble. Sometimes you have to picture likely hands for partner to have to determine what to bid. Ginny doesn't know for sure that Marge has six good clubs, but that is certainly possible. And if all she has is AQxxxx of clubs and say the HQ (and that is only 8 HCP, probably not enough to say 3C), 3N has plays. The main point here is new suits by responder are forcing even if you are an overcaller. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, Ginny is not allowed to pass. Her partner knows 3C is forcing, so takes that into account when she bids 3C. One more point. 2S by Mei ann is highly aggressive. But both of us being aggressive made you miss your game. Mine was accidental and I would have passed with Mei ann's hand. 2S should show the same thing as if I opened 1S and Mei ann bid 2S, 5-9 or so and 3 card support. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another possibility by Marge is to bid 3S, asking Ginny to bid 3N with a spade stopper. But, since 3C is forcing, that is ok as well. I happen to like 3C better, but you should keep cue bids in mind in competitive auction.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me just briefly describe the difference between Regular Bergen and Reverse Bergen Raises. Most on BBO seem to play Reverse Bergen Raises. Basically, if you play Bergen raises, there are 3 kinds of raises you can make. You can make a preemptive raise (4-6), constructive raise (7-9), or limit raise (10-12). Those raises are all done with 4 card support. In both regular Bergen and reverse Bergen, 3 of partner's suit (3H on this hand), is a preemptive raise (4-6). |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3C and 3D are reserved for the other kind of raises. If you play regular Bergen 3C is the weaker of the 2 raises (7-9) and 3D the stronger (10-12). If you play reverse Bergen the two bids are simply reversed, so 3C is the stronger raise (10-12) and 3D the weaker raise (7-9). Since Ginny wanted to play regular, not reverse, Bergen, Marge's bid was 3C, since she has 7 points. |

PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, again, it is a matter of finding the best line to not lose 5 tricks. Ginny has 4 sure losers, 1 club, 2 diamonds and 1 spade. The whole hand comes down to trying to play the spade suit for 1 loser, not 2. There are 2 possibilities. You can play one of us for a doubleton Ace. Say you play Mei ann for a doubleton Ace. You lead low towards the SK. When it wins you lead low towards your hand and put up the 6. But, that is a pretty low percentage play. The much higher percentage play is to play Mei ann for the Jack. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|So, if you like, you can lead a low spade towards the Queen. Whether that wins or loses, the next time you get in, you play a low spade intending to finesse the 10 if no honor appears. The reason for playing a low spade towards the Queen first is, in case Mei ann has a doubleton Jack, or I have a singleton honor, you eliminate the guess. But, most of the time it won't matter. However, at least if you play Mei ann for the Jack, you have a 50% chance of making the contract. 50% is better than 0%. Always give yourself some chance to make.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Mei ann probably does not have 5 spades because she failed to overcall 1S over 1C. Remember, what partner does not bid is often as important as what she does bid. If she has 5 spades, they must be pretty weak because she must have a good hand, probably with clubs but she cant bid 2C, as that would be a heart raise. So, she has to find a bid, and hope you will bid diamonds so you can get to 3N.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|In fairness, this was a very hard hand for E/W to bid correctly. Ginny can't bid 3N, she doesn't have a club stopper. I was saying it was likely that Mei ann has clubs, but she doesn't know that for sure. |

gimit: Actually had I been playing with my real life friends and had I had another honor in @d, I'd have bid 2NT over 1C = 2 lower suits possible--5/5.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|That would have been a good bid even with the hand you had, it was a possibility. One possibility, as Ginny mentioned, was for her to bid 2N, to show 5/5 in the 2 lowest unbid suits. But, 1H was fine. Over 2D Mei ann is sort of stuck, so, 2S was okay. Now it might occur to Ginny that, since Mei ann is voluntarily bidding over 2D, she must have a good hand. But, if she has a good hand, why did she pass originally? |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|One strong potability is that she has clubs. Mei ann can't really double with her hand, as she has neither diamonds nor hearts. The double there should be penalty or at least show diamonds. Anyway, as I said this is a hard hand to bid. Let me suggest the following auction: 1C-P-P-1H-2D-2S-P-3D-P-3N. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Another possibility is for Mei ann to bid 2H over 2D. Since @HKQ is almost as good as 3 card support. It is awfully good 2 card support. The only problem with her bidding 2H is she is too strong. You could easily be missing game. |

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Good question Ginny but there is a good answer. When you are looking for NT, bidding rules are as follows. If the opponents have bid 2 suits, then your bidding one of their suits shows a stopper. If the opponents have bid only 1 suit, then your bidding their suit asks for a stopper. I am just saying, this was an interesting hand to bid. BTW, these hands are completely random. I do not come up with them to torture my students, lol. Blame BBO. |

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, it did not work this time. My hand is hard to evaluate. If you use Bergen's hand evaluation, it is worth 8 HCP, plus 1 quality suit point, plus 1 length point, for a total of 10 points. It is really hard to say what to bid. It is one of those hands where 2N might be too high (such as this hand), or it makes 3. I felt 2N was too weak for the hand, as partner might not bid 3 on the right hands. So, I took a risk and in IMPs it turned out it only cost me 50 points, which is minimal.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|The auction 1N-P-2N-P-P-P seldom works well. It is only right if you make exactly 2. Had the West and East hands been reversed, the opening lead might very well have been a spade and then we take 9 tricks off the top. So my bid was a high risk high reward bid, and unlikely to cost us much in any case.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first the bidding. I would strongly consider overcalling 2D with Jackie's hand, although many would not. It turns out we can probably make 3D with our 9 card fit. 6-4 hands are very powerful and because Jackie has 4 cards in Stan's spade suit, it is likely I am short in spades which makes it more likely I have diamond support. In fact, 3 diamonds for me is probably slightly below average.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play. First of all, I don't like leading unprotected Aces and on this hand, it is also not a good idea, because Jackie has a natural trump trick. So, there is little reason for her to want to ruff anything. When you are long in trumps, your goal is to shorten declarer, so he loses control. Here, though, Stan did lose control, but given Jackie's defense he should have made it. All he needed to do was pitch the Q (or J) of clubs under the King, so he could have a club entry to his hand.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Had he done that he would have taken 4 clubs, 4 spades and a heart and made 3. However, if Jackie starts with a diamond (my choice), then Stan ends up having to ruff diamonds, and loses control for sure because Stan will end up with fewer trump than Jackie, and she will be able to run diamonds. So, with careful planning, Stan could make 3 on this defense but with a diamond lead, he is always down. In general, when you are long in trumps, it is good strategy to make declarer ruff and shorten his trumps.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|One other note about forcing NT. Is 1NT still forcing by a passed hand? There are 2 schools of thought about this. One is, it is not forcing since partner is a passed hand, if opener has a weak hand, game is unlikely so the theory is opener should be able to pass 1N when appropriate. On this hand, Stan would bid 2C in any case, but with a balanced weak hand, if not playing forcing he could pass. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|However, particularly if you don't play Drury, Ann could theoretically have the limit raise with 3 trump and bid 1NT. So, if you play it non-forcing, you might miss your spade partial. If you play Drury, then 2C and 2D show 3-card and 4-card spade raises respectively.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|To keep things simple, I play 1NT is still forcing. But Marty Bergen recommends that it not be forcing and he feels very strongly about it. My recommendation, keep it forcing, is for simplicity particularly if you don't play Drury. Another issue that partnership just has to agree. |

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|First, let's start with Pam's 2S bid.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|
onoway: It was a compromise, seven spades but no points.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|It is very reasonable. "Mr. aggressive preempter", Howard might bid 3, but 2 makes perfect sense given Pam has no shortness nor a good suit. Now, what should I bid? First, of all I have enough points that even if Pam is towards the bottom of her range, we are in the game range. Many students make the mistake of trying to bid 3N when they are short in the preempter's suit. However, that is a bad idea. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|In fact, you should be more prone to bid 3N when you have length in the suit than when you are short. The reason is as follows:
Pam's hand is worth a lot of tricks in spades. However, since you are short in spades, it might take a couple of entries to Pam's hand to set up her suit in No Trump. And she is unlikely to have those entries. So, the moral of the story is, try very hard to play in the preempter's suit if you can. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|I decided even with 1 spade, since it was the singleton Ace, it was quite possible Pam only had 1 spade loser or perhaps 2. But, I knew 3N had no plays, as I have no source of tricks outside spades. Thus, I bid 4S as our best shot at game.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|With perfect defense and declarer play, Pam should go down 2, losing 2 spades, 1 club, 1 diamond (if she guesses correctly), and 1 heart. There were a couple of issues with the defense. At trick 2, leading back a heart is very dangerous and likely to give away a trick. I would lead back a spade personally, as that is very safe. It is unlikely (although possible) that East is out of hearts. It is more likely they are either 2-2 among East and North, or North is out. So, a heart is not a good play. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Another choice is a club, hoping either declarer will misguess or East has the Queen. I don't mind Darlene's duck of the club, although she should be worried as I always say, second hand low is usually right. So, having said that, Ally should duck the @SQueen. If Pam is being tricky from KJ, Ally can congratulate her on her tricky play. But, it is very likely her partner has the King and that way at least the hand is down 1. So, if both partners follow the "second hand low" rule, the contract is still down. |

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|6H was certainly a reasonable contract. Had spades broken better it would have made. However, once Ally leads a spade, there is an alternative line. I would be suspicious of the spade lead and assume it could very well be a singleton. So, I would play the hand as follows. Let me reload and play it out.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|A few comments on this hand. Some people would not open 1NT with my hand, lacking stoppers in 2 suits. But, I think any balanced hand with 15-17 is best opened 1NT even if you have a 5 card major because otherwise, your point count is very hard to get across. There is no good rebid if you don't open those hands 1NT. If for example, you open say 1S and pard bids 1N, what do you do?|
PG| ***** 263 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|First of all, even if 2N is right, the contract is probably wrong sided and second of all, 2N may be too high if partner has a real weak hand. So, if you open 1N, you get your point count across. The only small danger in opening 1N with a 5 card major is you might miss a 5-3 fit. However, often with a 5-3 fit, 3N does just as well as 4 of the major.Once in a while, it turns out you can only take 9 tricks, even with your 5-3 fit.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|As far as the play goes once there is a diamond lead, Stan can count 7 tricks. And he wisely took them, because there is some chance if he messes around, he could end up losing 4 or 5 hearts and 3 clubs.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the defense made the classic mistake of switching suits. This hand should be down 1 for sure, and possibly down 2. It is hard for Jackie to lead a diamond when she is in, but once she plays a spade, she should continue the suit. By switching between diamonds and spades, you ended up knocking out the defense stoppers in 2 suits and therefore set up 2 extra tricks for Stan. In general, once you start a suit on defense, continue playing it, unless you have  a clear reason not to. And on this hand there was no clear reason. |
PG| ***** 282 ***** |


NT||cp|8|
AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717 ^*N|cp||at|In fact, it was pretty clear Stan could not have the King and Queen of spades both because he probably plays a spade at some point if he did. And even if he did have both, once Jackie plays the Ace they are set up anyway, so you might as well continue. The moral of the story is, decide on a defense, and stick to it, unless you have a very good reason that you can articulate to switch.|

cp|8|fp||at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log.
