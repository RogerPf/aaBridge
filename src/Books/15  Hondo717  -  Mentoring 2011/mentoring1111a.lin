^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was actually quite an interesting hand. First the auction. Should Fred bid over 2S? I know it is hard to resist bidding with 18 points  and we have found a fit, so it is likely E/W has a fit as well. However, there is a case to be made for passing. Although bidding could work as well. Fred has some good defense and has some hope of beating 2S. In fact, it turns out we are down 1. Additionally, partner has not raised either of Fred's suit. So it is very probable at best they have an 8 card heart fit, or else partner has long diamonds and chose not to bid.|

gorrila: Could Fred bid 2NT instead of double?	|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting question by Gorrila. The short answer is no, but let me explain. The points are pretty evenly spread  and it is hard to make 2N with 20 or so points between the 2 hands. So tempting as it is to bid, Fred should seriously consider passing. Having said that, my wife had a similar hand several days ago in live bridge, and bid 2N. She could not resist bidding either. However, it did work out badly for us. So, even with a strong balanced hand, when partner is known to be weak, pass should be considered.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play. The one interesting thing I wish to point out is my low diamond play when I had the Queen and dummy had the Jack. I knew Gorrila could ruff the diamond  but I was hoping Ally had the H10. In this fashion,  I was trying to make it clear to Ally to ruff the diamond, and thus set up my HJ. That play is known as a "Uppercut"  where one defender ruffs high, and promotes a trump in their partner's hand that ordinarily would not win a trick.|

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was an interesting auction, and I learned something about playing 2-way Stayman. As I said, if Ally just had a non-invitational hand with spades, she bids 2H to transfer to spades. So, by bidding Stayman and then showing 5 spades, she is showing 10 or 11  and since I have a maximum I should bid 3NT--for weak NT of course.  I always make 3 once Fred returns a diamond. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. A diamond is certainly reasonable on the auction, and I might very well have chosen it. However, it turns out that, although in general it is a bad idea to lead a suit the opponents have bid, this is one hand with a possible exception. It turns out that if declarer bids a major, and it is likely to be only 4 cards and weak and you as opening leader hold 4+ cards in that major with 2 honors  it is often right to lead that suit. So, since I am known to have 4 hearts (I opened 1N 12-14 not 1H)  and Gorrila has 2 honors in hearts, a heart lead can be considered. In this case, it works pretty well.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I learned that several years ago from an opening leads book, and found it very surprising. But over the years I have noticed it often works well but occasionally fails spectacularly, lol. |

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see if Gorrila should consider slam. He does have the following dummy points. 14 HCP, 1 quality suit and 1 doubleton = 16. So, if South has 17+ dummy points, slam is possible. Some people would consider slam, and that would not be a terrible idea. However, there are some minuses to the Gorrila's hand. First, of all, you need close to a maximum from South. Second, we only have a probable 8 card fit. On close contracts, you should tend to be conservative with an 8-card fit, more aggressive with a 9-card fit. Finally, Gorrila has kind of flat distribution. Because of those 3 factors (pard needs a max, 8-card fit, flat distribution) I would tend to be conservative.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I have several partners who would definitely consider slam. Even with a 3-2 spades break, it needs the club finesse, managing 2 ruffs in one hand, and a very careful play. All in all it is not a very good contract. probably around 25%.|

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's get back to the auction first. South has 16 Starting Points: 15 HCP,  plus 2 length points, and -1 for singleton K (and I will discuss the K further later). Once I raise hearts, he can add 2 for singleton plus 1 for 4+ diamonds for 19  Declarer Points. So, 4H is reasonable. In addition, 5/5 is excellent distribution. On close bids, you should upgrade your hand. same thing for 6-4 which is another reasonably common excellent distribution. If you have 5/5 or 6/4 and are on the borderline, be aggressive. On the other hand if you have a hand with no singletons or voids, be more conservative.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, on this hand I would fully discount the CK another point since Fred bid clubs. But I still bid 4H.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. 4H is not makeable if they keep playing clubs. But the right way to play it is to ruff the 2nd club, and play a spade to the King and a heart back. If East ducks, play  the HK and go back to the board with the SA and play another heart. East wins, the heart and plays a black card. you must ruff, and then you only have one trump left. So you play 3 rounds of diamonds, and then if they play another club you are down.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I often see inexperienced declarers try and ruff cards in the long hand which usually is not a good idea, as all it does is shorten your trump. This is the way to look at it. If South can manage 1 heart loser, then he has 4 heart winners. And there is no difference between playing your long hearts out and throwing a club as there is in ruffing a club. The only thing ruffing a club does is shorten South's trump which is a disadvantage, not an advantage.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, avoid ruffing in the long hand unless you have a good reason (such as you need an entry, or are trying to set up dummy's long suit). On the other hand, ruffing in the short hand is a very GOOD idea. That creates an extra trick. For example on this hand, if South were able to ruff something in dummy, that would mean 5 heart tricks, 4 long hearts plus the ruff in dummy.|

This week I have a new product. As you already know Howard has two mentoring sessions playing a total of 12 boards with his students. Each week I select four best teaching board for the weekly presentation. As a result several other boards also with great teaching material are left unused. That I have to do, with regrets, because there is not enough time for me to develop them. So, here and there, I plan to use them showing only the specific teaching part. One more point.

In general, I am a big believer in "4th from longest and strongest." Although no opening lead rule is perfect, that rule has served me well over the years. So, in this deal, I would have led a club. On a real good day, pard would have the King. But even if she does not, you will set up some club tricks. You can make a case for leading either a low club or the Queen. However, I  would lead low.|

up||pc|c3|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another point on the opening lead. Leading from Jxx is usually a very weak lead. It often gives a lot away. This hand is a good example of that. No matter how the hand is defended, North has 4 diamonds and 2 spades if she plays diamonds correctly. But a club lead will get the defense off on the right foot.|

One theory is you bid "6-4-6" meaning you bid your 4 card suit next and then rebid your 6 card suit. Therefore, here the correct bid is 2C|MB|2c|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|sk||cp||at|I personally like rebidding my six card suit, particularly if it is a major. On this hand, it turns out that is not optimal, but it usually works out fine. |

However, West's hand is so good, that I would be willing to bid game, or at least 3 in whatever major partner has. So, I would have bid Michaels, and raise partner's response from 2 to 3.However, 1S has merit as well	 because her hand is really too good for Michaels.|

nome: Had West bid Michaels--2C-- with strong hand. What would be East's priority  in bidding with her two majors? |

sk||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You favor length over strength. With equal length (as on this hand) you favor the stronger suit (spades on this hand)  although J7x and 108x are pretty close.|

xXx_Cpt: Isn't there a way to say "Partner choose your best 5-card suit" in response to Michaels? |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the opponents have bid a suit she can cue bid the suit (clubs in this case). Otherwise many people play 2N (e.g. 1C-2C-P-2N) asks partner to choose.	|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, HERE^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
