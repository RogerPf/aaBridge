up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I ended up making it. But it is a very tricky hand to play. I expect many non-expert players would go down in 4@S. However, as you saw, 4@S is much better than 3N.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kibt: ^*NWould a 4 diamond splinter bid over 2N be better to show shape or does that imply four trumps?|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an expert splinter bid. Over 2NT, there would be no reason for 4@D to be natural. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Experts define a splinter as "an unnecessary jump." So on this auction 4@D would show 3-card spade support and a singleton diamond which is what North had and is a possible expert bid, assuming partner understood what it meant. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why 3-card support and not 4-card support? Because there is a very important rule that I strongly urge you to follow always.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partners opens 1 of a major and you have 4-card support you always, 100% of times, you must show your support immediately, regardless of what else you have in your hand. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So once North responds 2@C, it denies 4-card support and therefore, the 4@D splinter bid must be with 3-card support. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, I am not sure I would bid 4@D with the North hand, although I think it is reasonable to consider it. The quality of your trump suit does matter, especially in an 8-card fit and North knows we have an 8-card fit. Because I would have rebid spades with a 6-card suit. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with the weak spades, I probably just bid 3@S rather than the more encouraging 4@D. And, as you saw, we ended up losing 2 trump tricks, despite the fact that I had reasonably nice spades. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you considered the 4@D bid, kudos to you for thinking about it. That is a very expert bid.|

Leading a singleton is often right. If partner has the @SA and the @DK, we can beat the hand. But this might work out badly.|pc|S5|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should have taken the club finesse. If for no other reason that by not taking it you are guaranteed down 1. But the other reason is I showed clubs so it is very likely the club finesse is working.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if you think a finesse is losing you should take it unless you have a very good reason not to.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand there really wasn't a good reason not to. Yes, if it lost, then East was losing 2 diamond tricks as well. But by not taking it that guaranteed down 1.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, over 1@H-2NT (the 2NT bidder has clubs and diamonds) 2 cue bids are available--3@C and 3@D. 3@C cuebid shows the lower of the 2 remaining suits (hearts here) regardless of what partner opened. It shows a limit raise or better.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D shows the higher of the remaining suits (spades) and shows close to a game force. Therefore, 3@H simply shows a weakish heart raise and 3@S shows long spades but no more than 9 or 10 at most.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Saying it differently, the cue bids show better hands and the direct bids show weaker hands. It can be a little confusing to play that, but it is a good convention once you get the hang of it.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't play unusual over unusual you should at least play that a cue bid of the suit that the opponent showed is a limit raise or better and therefore a direct raise is weake--just competing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is incorrect. With no information, the drop is (very slightly) better than the finesse. But you have lots of information from the bidding.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


at|^^^^I have diamonds and a major. So I am short in clubs. I could have @CQx. But it is more likely I have a singleton. So you should finesse North for the @CQ.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general you should only play for the drop if you have no information about the defenders' hands. But if one defender has shown a 5+ card suit, you should finesse the other defender for the queen rather than playing for the drop.|
