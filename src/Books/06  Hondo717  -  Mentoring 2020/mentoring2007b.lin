nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense, normally you play 2nd hand low. However, on the opening club lead, partner is known not to have the ace. So, at trick six, East can figure out if they don't take the @SA North can discard the @SK on the @CA. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a rare exception to playing 2nd hand low. Having said that, if you always play 2nd hand low smoothly, you will do very well most of the time.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading away from AQ is terrible. I wouldn't hate leading the @SA given the auction. But a low spade is a bad idea.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally speaking, leading an unprotected ace is often a bad lead and should be avoided. Although it can work out when partner bids the suit.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|NS should not have made 6@H. Against the best defense, declarer will lose
^k 1 diamond, 1 spade, and 1 heart. As to whether NS should be in 4@H.    

It is a reasonable game, although declarer would go down if West holds the @SA. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Can it be bid? The idea behind |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at|  is to allow you to compete for a part score after a 1NT opener and not worry about bidding game.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So DONT caters to the many hands where you want to compete for a part score and doesn't worry about the rare hand where your side can make game. Even on this hand, it is not clear that NS should get to 4@H.|

PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, North has a nice hand so 2@C is acceptable but risky. As to East, 2@D is not the best bid even if East decides to raise diamonds.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D shows 6-9 points and probably no more than 4 diamonds. If East had a limit raise in diamonds, the bid should be 3@C or 3@D with < 10 points and 5 diamonds. So 2@D is clearly not best.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming East wants to raise diamonds, let's count dummy points. The hand has 6 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point, 3 points for singleton with 4 trump, and 2 points for the doubleton.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is quite a hand. It has 14 dummy points with only 6 HCP. It is a good illustration of how distribution is often way more important than HCP.|
