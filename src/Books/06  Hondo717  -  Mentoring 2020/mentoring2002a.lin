up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As with every hand, as declarer you need to come up with a plan before following from dummy at trick 1. Otherwise, you will sometimes play the wrong card. Further, you need to watch the opponents carding for clues.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand, once it seems likely from the play that hearts are luckily 4-4 there is an easy path to 9 tricks if you count your winners.|

mb|P|mb|2N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N very reasonable. But I would not object if West decided to upgrade her hand due to the super spade suit and open 2@C followed by 2N which shows 22-24.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H was not that bad. With the @HQ it has plays. East had a very bad hand for West. Just change the @HJ to the @HQ and 4@H is a very good contract. West should only go down 1 losing 2 diamonds and 2 hearts. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The club discard (third trick) on the 4th diamond was really not a loser on loser play because declarer can discard dummy's club loser on a spade. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the best play is to ruff the diamond probably with the 8 and hope (although the odds not good) that south holds the @HQ and @H9.|

at|^*bEast:^*n Is it possible we can take 5 tricks in the red suits?|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, but a spade lead is somewhat likely because partner is short in spades (on average will have less than 2 spades).|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the defenders likely have an 8 or 9 card spade fit. And it is unlikely we will lead a heart since East has 4. Even if we lead a heart, it is unlikely we can take 5 heart tricks although 4 is possible.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it is possible with a heart lead, or a diamond lead, assuming North has the @DA, and a heart shift, 3N goes down. However, it is much more likely it is making.|sk||

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway the main point was that East should do what I call "picture bidding." East can picture a hand where 3NT makes and, therefore, should bid it. It is not a matter of HCP. It's a matter of counting tricks.|

pc|S6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 2 spades 2 hearts 3 clubs and 2 diamonds tricks off the top. That's 9. One way to get a 10th trick is to play for 3-2 diamonds. Another way is to play hearts. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I guess the @HQ and hearts are 3-3 I can take 11 tricks. And even if I misguess the hearts I have 10 tricks in case West has KJ.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I may have a squeeze for 12 tricks if I carefully keep track of spades and hearts. Sometimes even though I don't have a legitimate squeeze, the defenders make a mistake with their discards. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even experts have trouble discarding. So whenever you have all the tricks but one, especially in Match Points, run your tricks because you might have a squeeze or the opponents might discard incorrectly.|
