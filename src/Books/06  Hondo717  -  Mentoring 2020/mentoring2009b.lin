mb|P|mb|1S|mb|P|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East made a conservative bid. If dealer, most would open East's hand.

So 1N is possible but very conservative.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again discarding is hard and once again defender misdiscarded. In this case at trick 11, however, North should know to discard the @SK because West probably has another club as he didn't cash the @C10 when in dummy. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North has to hope I have the @SJ. Additionally, if West started with AJ of spades likely would have played low rather than the @SQ on first spade. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But again these are very hard inferences to make which is why you can and should play for the opponents to discard incorrectly.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So once again, in this board and board 4, although the bidding was correct 3N makes. Both hands were very lucky to make 3N. In fact, with perfect defense can't make it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perfect defense was diamond leads.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NThis is the second hand where the 2N invite makes 3. Do you ever use the Rule of 16? Both board 4 and 6 would qualify.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What is the Rule of 16?|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


at|^^
^B@2^*BSame Kib: ^*NYou add high card points to all cards 8 and higher. If 16 you go to 3.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, that counts intermediate cards. But not sure I totally agree.|
