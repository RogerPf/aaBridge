UP|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think double by West was fine, planning double and correct. The question is, should West bid 4@H over 3@S.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would. 6-4 hands with 2 quality suits are wonderful on offense. And I am willing to let them play 4@H as I don't think that is making. 4@H ends up down 1--losing 1 spade, 1 heart, and 2 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs it is basically a wash but good Matchpoint score. And if we end up bidding 4@S, which is possible (although we won't on this particular hand) then EW get a good result.|

up|34|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay. Well played and bid. Let's see how we do in spades. We lose 1 spade, 2 hearts, 2 clubs, and 1 diamond. Not so well even in 3@S. But 3@S still the right bid. It is hard for the defense to double a part sore.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@S is far from clear. In fact "the 5 level belongs to the opponents" is a good principle to follow. 5 level decisions are among the hardest bidding problems in bridge.|

up|20|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again "5 level belongs to the opponents" is correct. Iin 5@C we lose 1 spade, 1 heart, and 1 diamond for down 1.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, 5 level decisions are extremely difficult. In general, you should not bid 5 over unless you have a really good reason to do so.|
