mb|1N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has a limit raise. Playing 2/1 he bids 1N followed by 3@S to show that hand. Classic way to show a 3-card limit raise.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2h|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H promises 4. You have to bid 2@D, which only promises 3 diamonds. This is a very standard 2/1 response to a forcing NT.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over a forcing NT, your choices are to bid 2@H with 4, 2@S with 6, or else you must default to a 3-card minor.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a clear 4@S bid, just as she did. Although technically she has only 14 HCP, the hand is much better than that. All the HCP are in aces and kings, and you add 1 for length.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So at a minimum 25 points between the 2 hands.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since you can have up to 2 Quick Tricks in each suit, there are 8 possible Quick Tricks. There are 40 HCP. So 40/8 means a Quick Trick is worth around 5 points. Therefore, you count your Quick Tricks and multiply by 5.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If your Quick trick Points are equal or greater than your HCP your hand is better than its HCP indicate. In this case, East has 3.5 Quick Tricks = 17.5 Quick Trick Points So the 14 HCP are much better than they look.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically Qick Trick Points mean you upgrade for aces and kings and queens paired with aces and kings. All of which are good things. Therefore, on a marginal call, if you have a lot of Quick Trick Points you should be aggressive.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But East needs an entry to take the diamond finesse against the queen again if North wins the @DA. Therefore, so East must preserve the heart entry. With the HK10 East has a sure heart entry. And East should should play the @D9 now. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NWhy?|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because you can't bid 2@D or 1@S. 2@D is game force. You do not have a game forcing hand. You cannot bid 1@S because it promises 4 spades. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your only choice is to bid a forcing 1NT and perhaps bid your diamonds later to show a weakish hand with a lot of diamonds.|

There is some chance NS can make either 5@C or 4@S. I am not sure if I would bid 3@C with the North hand, but it is a reasonable choice.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other choices are 2@C or double. I might choose double and if partner bids 2@D, I think North is strong enough to double and correct to clubs.|

PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat in particular, there are tactical considerations that are very important to  preempt even with ostensibly opening hands. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The partner has passed so the likelihood you will miss game if you preempt with an opener is not very high. In current situation, after 2 passes, withh East only having 9 HCP it is just about certain that South has a very strong hand.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Inn fact, Bergen has something called the rule of 24 which quantifies how to estimate how strong 4th seat is. According to him, after 2 passes, the 2 passing hands will average 16 HCP between them it turns out.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means 3rd and 4th seat will average around 24 HCP. Here East has 9 HCP. That means on average South will hold around 15 HCP.

The 1@S bid by West promised 5 spades. So East could very well have bid 2@S with only 3.

And even if it weren't North still should pass. North already showed her hand with the 2@C bid. North has nothing extra.|
