mb|3S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should pass 2@S. One reason, as we will see, is that 3 hearts is the worst holding you can have in the opponent's suit. Further, the best reason not bid 3@S, is North has a very bad hand other than the @SA.|

mb|P|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for South.^^2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I theoretically could bid 3@H here. 3@H does NOT show 16-18 points or similar [in 2/1 auctions]. It simply shows a "self-sufficient" heart suit. A self-sufficient suit is defined as a suit with at most one loser opposite a small singleton.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And in this case if partner has a small heart we have a 7 card fit. since hearts will break 4-2 at worst almost all the time. That means my heart suit is self-sufficient.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But here I am not going to bid 3@H because it also tends to show slam interest. And since my only honor outside hearts is a queen, I have no controls and hence slam is very unlikely unless partner has a nice hand with lots of controls.|mb|2H|

PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And unless we lack a stopper somewhere my hearts are going to take the same 6 tricks in NT as they are in hearts. And 3N only requires 9 tricks not 10.|mb|3N|

pc|S2|pc|SQ|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is very straight forward. North has 10 easy tricks--6 hearts, 3 diamonds and 1 spade. North should not lose the lead until she takes her tricks because she could conceivably lose 4 clubs tricks.|pc|SA|
