And BTW, this is another argument for opening 1@C with 4-4 in the minors because if you open 1@C, partner does not have to bid 1NT unless his hand is exactly 3-3-3-4.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that I do have 11 HCP. So I could bid 2@C given I was a passed hand. If not a passed hand and playing 2/1 Game Forcing I couldn't bid 2@C.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, I could also bid 2N which you should play as 11-12.|

pc|S6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 1 spade, 3 hearts, 1 diamond, and 1 club for only 6 tricks. I probably could have a 4th heart for 7. So I need 2 more tricks somewhere probably diamonds. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So West needs the @DKJ or spades have to be 4-4 and diamonds 3-3 with West having at least 1 honor. That is not hopeless but not great odds.|
