nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It shows 4+ spades, game forcing values, and a singleton (or rarely a void) in clubs. That sometimes allows you to bid slams with fewer HCP when you have a good fit.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good fit means you have no wasted values in clubs. Ideal holdings in clubs would be 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the ace. @CK10x is not a good club holding. So with a minimum hand and less than ideal clubs, West should just bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, sometimes you are too strong to make a splinter bid. Splinter bids take up a lot of room, so if you have 16 or more dummy points you should just bid 2N to keep the bidding lower. East is close to being too strong.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 11 HCP, 1 quality suit point, 1 length point, and 3 points for the singleton with 4+ trump. Therefore, I wouldn't dislike 2N. However, 4@C is fine and good for illustrative purposes for this lesson.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Definitely not. Maybe in slam. But certainly not in game. In fact, a trump lead is often a good lead. You know dummy will be ruffing clubs, so a trump lead cuts down on the number of clubs dummy will be able to ruff. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out on this particular hand, because dummy has 5 spades, a trump lead does not help. But notice that if dummy only had 4 trump, a trump lead and trump continuation after the defense wins a club would have eliminated a 3rd club ruff.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only way I will lose 2 clubs is if East holds KJx of clubs because the right way to play the club suit is to cash the @CA. Often a singleton honor will come down. And on a really good day East will have the singleton @CK and I will not lose any club tricks because I can take the marked finesse against the jack.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on most days, clubs will either be 2-2, a singleton honor will appear, or West will have started with KJx of clubs. So the odds of losing 2 club tricks is very small.|
