PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think it is aggressive because a) the @HJ is likely not worth anything (if partner has the @HQ) and b) the diamond suit is very weak. But as I said technically it does qualify as a 3@H bid.|

West has 13 HCP, 1 quality suit point, 2 points for a singleton, and 2 points for two 4-card side suits for a total of 18 points. That is enough possibly for slam.

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So we got lucky thanks to the spade lead by East which generated an extra heart ruff. Again, defense is hard and often you make contracts that would go down if defended perfectly. Here with good defense we should be down one.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2@S, they lose 2 Spades, 2 hearts, 1 diamond, and 1 club for down one. Therefore, it turned out, if we didn't make 3@C my double would not have paid off unless we talked them into 3@S. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However as a general guideline, you do not want to let them play at the 2 level when you know they have an 8+ card fit, and the points are approximately even between the 2 sides. That will usually be an average minus board at best.|

pc|SJ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see how North could plan taking nine tricks. North has 1 spade, 2 hearts, 3 diamonds and 2 clubs. that is eight. North has to hope clubs behave and West gets in with a club. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North can play AK of clubs. On a real lucky day @CQ10 is doubleton. On a somewhat lucky day, clubs are 3-3 with West having the @CQ.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other chance I guess is to play 3 rounds of diamonds and then @CAK and a low club. I will let North play as he likes and I will help West to defend expertly.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At most tables, declarer would make 3NT. But I had West defend in an expert manner.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first good play was for West to duck 2 rounds of hearts. Had West taken the @HA prematurely, declarer would have been able to get to dummy and cash South's 4th heart for the 9th trick.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the real expert play was for West to discard the @CQ under the @CK. Very few players would do that. By doing so, that gave East an entry with the @C10, allowing East to lead spades and preventing South's @SQ from winning a trick. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West not discarded the @CQ, declarer could lead a 3rd round of clubs, throwing West in. West would then be end played. West could cash the @HA and @SA, but eventually would have to lead a low spade, allowing South's @SQ to win the trick.|
