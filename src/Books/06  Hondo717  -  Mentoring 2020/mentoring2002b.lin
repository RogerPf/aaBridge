nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you play kickback, RKCB is one suit higher than the trump suit. That means since clubs are trump, 4@D would be RKCB. The convention is a little advanced for most players. But even if you don't play full Kickback, you definitely should play it when hearts are trump.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should bid 4@S rather than 4NT as RKCB because then you can always do the queen ask even if the response is the 2nd step. If hearts are trump and you bid 4NT as RKCB then if partner responds 5@C, you can do the queen ask of 5@D without going past 5@H. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if partner responds 5@D, you can't do the queen ask (which would be 5@S) without going past 5@H and you might not want to do that. So if you play 4@S as RKCB for hearts then whether partner responds 4NT or 5@C you can do the queen ask without going past 5@H. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, if you play Kickback, most play 0314 instead of the rather silly 1430 that most play. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, on this hand clubs are trump so playing Kickback 4@D is RKCB (1 higher than the trump suit). The responses (assuming 0314) are 4@H = 0 or 3, 4@S = 1 or 4, 4N = 2 no Q, 5@C = 2 Key-cards with Q.|mb|4D|

mb|P|mb|5C|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|6C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid. When trying for slam over RKCB, you should go if you have all 5 Key-cards or 4 keys and the trump queen, as on this hand. It turns out it is not a great slam, but the bidding was still fine. If I led a spade (which is far from clear) it is probably always down. But here at least if the heart finesse works, it will make.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C is a reasonable bid by North since North's clubs are so much better than the diamonds. However, a 3@D overcall is possible because then it gives North room to bid 4@C. Generally when you have 2 suits of equal length you tend to bid the higher suit unless the lower one is strong and the higher one is weak. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here admitedly the lower suit clubs is stronger than the higher suit diamonds. But the diamonds do have 2 honors plus another intermediate. So they are not that weak. As to my 4@S bid, I had close to a "self sufficient" suit. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A self sufficient suit is one that is likely to have one loser opposite a singleton. Here if North had a small singleton than I might have 2 losers if spades were 4-2. But if North had the king, as he did I have no losers and the 10 gives me only one spade loser. So that's why I felt 4@S was justified.
|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NIf North bid 3@D, would you show support for diamonds or show the self sufficient suit first?|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would still bid 4@S and feel better about it since we have a diamond fit. You should try for 4 of a major rather than 5 of a minor whenever possible. Granted, if North bid diamonds, 5@D is a better contract than 4@S.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To answer another question, 3@S by me is forcing. But 4@S is pretty likely to be where I want to play. Granted we might have 6. However, once there is a preempt a good bidding principle is to worry about finding your best game and don't worry too much about bidding slam. |

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1H|mb|P|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for North.^^3c|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North must support hearts when you have a limit raise. Whenever partner opens 1 of a major and you have 4 card support, you MUST support him even if you have a long side suit. If you don't support him immediately you are denying 4-card support. That is a very important bidding principle.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, I like Bergen or Reverse Bergen. Here North should bid 3@C as a Reverse Bergen 10-12 4-card raise. That way, 3@H is a weak jump raise.|

mb|3C|mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good lead directing double. You should make lead directing doubles over artificial bids (but only if partner will be on lead). Opening leads are often guesses. So anything you can do to help partner with their opening lead is very useful.|

I already have 16 Bergen Starting Points (13 HCP, 2 length points, and 1 point for 4 aces/tens and no queens/jacks). That's already enough to go to go to 4@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|18 Declarer Points certainly is enough to invite by bidding 3@S. But as I said on a previous hand, most experts play 3@S is NOT invitational. |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They expect, if they pass, for the opponents to come in because it is almost never right to let the opponents play at the 2 level when they have a fit and the points are approximately equal between the 2 sides|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 3@S is simply a competitive bid, saying you were going to bid 3@S if the opponents competed. This way, the opponents do not get to exchange information. So what East should do is bid a new suit to invite game-- either 3@D or 3@H.|mb|3D|

It is 4-3-3-3 and the spade support is weak. So I think it is clear not to accept the invitation by bidding 3@S.|mb|3S|
