I will only do that in 1st and 2nd seat with a singleton or void, not with 6-3-2-2. In 3rd seat I will do it even with 6-3-3-2. So I would have opened 3@C with the North hand.|

PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As what to lead from 3 small, you need to decide on opening lead what you lead from 3 small. Your choices are count (low from 3) or attitude (high to deny an honor). I prefer count. But if you like attitude then you lead high.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer count because count is not usually known at the beginning of the hand and you can often work out where honors are. However, in the middle of the hand as defender you should almost always lead attitude because count is usually known once dummy hits. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, from Q74 in diamonds for example on this hand (second trick) you lead the 4 but from 974 you lead the 9. You never lead middle. It is too ambiguous.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as I am concerned, those who lead middle from 3 small (known as MUD for middle, up, down) make it too hard to figure out what is going on.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It depends on your style. Tthese days many experts worry more about length than strength. The suit quality is not nearly as important as length. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, suppose you have an 8 card suit headed by the 9. Partner rates to have at least 1 card in your suit and if the opponents cards are divided 2-2 your weak 8 card suit is worth 6 tricks. Therefore, don't worry too much about suit quality when preempting.|
