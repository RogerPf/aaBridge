mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has to pass. On a different hand, if East's spades were better than hearts, East would correct to 2@S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With an abundance of resources in all suits, there are lots of reasonable ways to play the hand. So I probably just knock out the @HK and @DKQ rather than touching spades.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, just as an interesting point, I play a version of DONT called "delayed DONT". That means, assuming I have either not bid or passed, any bid I make over an opponent's 1NT either an opener or in the middle of the auction is still DONT.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand, if North had DONT distribution, and played "delayed DONT", they could balance with a DONT bid.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Responder's options over a double are:
One level bids are forcing.
Two level bids are weak (so if I bid 2@C or 2@D that shows a long suit and less than 10) and are not forcing.
Redouble shows 10 or more points.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could redouble here but with 5 spades I prefer 1@S, although I am a little worried because East rates to hold 4 spades.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is fine. But sometimes you want to preempt even with a min opener in 3rd seat. It is a matter of tactics. As a guideline, after 2 passes the first 2 players average around 16 HCP or so. That means the last 2 players average 24 or so.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 11 HCP meaning I am likely to have an opener. Therefore, a 2@S bid makes it harder for me to compete.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your side might miss game if you open 2@S with an opener. It is possible but not likely since West is a passed hand. And if West has some spades, he might bid 4 as a "sacrifice".|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just something to think about in 3rd seat. That is the most effective seat in which to preempt.|
