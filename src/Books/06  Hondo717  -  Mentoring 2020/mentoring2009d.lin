nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, 95% of the time the Law works and you should always use it in competitive auctions. Not to mention that declaring is better than defending in general because, just as on this hand, the defense often makes an error.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's bidding was very good. @D1 was correct and 3@C was good bid as well. I am not enamored with the 2@D bid by West. I like 1@S better. Another bid East could make is redouble to show 10+ points.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@D is forcing so it is okay but redouble gets your strength across.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It certainly would not promise 5. The only way West could have 5 spades is if they started with 6 clubs which is extremely unlikely.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever partner opens in a minor and rebids a major, you should assume that they have 4 cards in that major exactly. That will be the case 99% of the time.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to count your tricks. Start with @CK and @CQ. If clubs are breaking badly, more likely East is out more than West. West more likely to have 4 clubs than East.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||lg|f|at|   @2a)  I personally only open 1NT if my Starting Points are 16 when my HCP are 14. 
^f... but Marty Bergen disagrees with me. and 
b)  the dreaded 4-3-3-3 distribution. However, here 1NT is certainly reasonable.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should now bid 3@S over 1N. In fact at this vulnerability, with 7-4-1-1 distribution, which is really terrific 4@S would be reasonable. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that 3@S gives South a real problem. However, over 3@S bid, I probably double (not penalty per se, just showing points) and we end up in 3N anyway.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now what should North bid over 3@H? |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|
I do promise 5 hearts so 4@H is possible. But with 4-3-3-3 distribution, weak hearts, and a nice spade stopper, I think 3N is the better bid.|
