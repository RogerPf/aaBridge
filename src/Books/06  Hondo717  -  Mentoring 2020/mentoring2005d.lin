mb|1Cd|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is not completely unreasonable but it is flawed. East does not have to make a takeout double just because he has an opening hand. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case East has 4 cards in what North opened, no 4 card major, and only 3 cards in the other 3 suits. So I would argue that the flaws outweigh the advantages to doubling. But it is not that terrible, But we will undo the bid.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hand where declarer needs to plan and count at trick one. West should know that virtually all of the missing high cards are in the North hand because EW have 27 HCP between them leaving 13 for NS.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since North opened he must have just about all of them. In theory could have 11 and South 2, but once the opening lead is made, that is not possible because North doesn't have an opening hand with 11 HCP and no 5-card suit. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And after the first trick, North is known to have 4 clubs. So South at most has a Jack. Then West has to count tricks. West has 2 tricks for sure in spades, hearts, diamonds, and 2 tricks in clubs after the opening lead. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So one more trick needed. The best hope for the ninth trick is probably in diamonds since the @DQ is probably off side. Therefore, the best play in diamonds is to cash the @DA and @DK and hope for either doubleton @DQ or 3-3 diamonds and that happens to work. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, tough hand to play but it can be made if declarer uses all the available clues and does some careful planning.|

mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has to decide where are we going to end up on his hand. North can bid 4@H Texas Transfer and we play in 4@S if North has no mild or strong desire for a slam try.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North wants to make a slam try he has 2 choices. With a mild slam try is to bid 2@H and bid 4@S over my 2@S response. Then we can explore further.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since we have a known spade fit (I have at least 2) North, as declarer add on points, gets one point for the 6th spade, one point for the 4+ card side diamond suit, and 4 points for the 2 singletons. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is more than enough to bid slam. Therefore, the correct auction is to bid 4@H and then bid 4N over my 4@S bid.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way I play, which very few experts play is I play that 3 level responses over 1NT are slam tries and ask partner to start control bidding. So in that case, I would bid 3@S with the North's hand. So let's try that even though not standard.|mb|3S|

pg| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now North bids 4@H which shows a heart control and denies 1st or 2nd round control in diamonds. If I didn't have a diamond control, I would sign off in 4@S. But I do have diamond control.|mb|4H|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*n: But I don't have Heart control.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes you do. You have a singleton which is 2nd round control, so we don't have 2 heart losers.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A control is most often an ace or king, but it can be a void or singleton.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because I have diamond control I am going to bid RKCB. That guarantees I have a diamond control.|mb|4N|

pg| ***** 38 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now we are missing one key card so I am bidding just 6. However, even if I did not have the @SQ I would still bid 6 because based on this auction I know we don't need the @SQ. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is because the 3@S bid promises a 6-card suit and having a 10-card fit is the equivalent of having the queen of trump. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So when responding to RKCB, if you know you have a 10-card fit, you can say you have the trump queen because essentially you do. To put it another way, having a 10-card fit is the equivalent of holding the trump queen.|mb|6S|

PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East asked an interesting question. It is true that, especially when you are not vul and they are vul a sacrifice over a small slam can work out well because you can afford to go down as much as 6 tricks (-1400) vs their small slam which is worth 1400+.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you have to be sure they are not going down because if you sacrifice over a non-making slam you are in big trouble. So East should bid 4@C over 3@S and that would get them to a 7@H sacrifice. Also, West could bid 3@H over 1NT using LOTT.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 7@H we take 1 spade, 2 diamonds, 1 heart, and 2 clubs for E/W going down 6 which essentially is break even in IMPs. In Match Points they do better than us making 6@S. Of course, we would double 7@H. In Match Points they are doomed to a bad board once we get to 6@S.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand West should probably duck the @HA at trick two. And definitely should not lead back a low diamond. Also, when a diamond is led, East should consider playing the @D10 rather than the @DA.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And East should not cash the @SA. Cashing aces on defense without capturing honors often gives away a trick. So, as is often the case, because of imperfect defense, which happens even with experts, I made a hand that should go down.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done by everyone. I would probably rebid 1N with the West hand over 1@S. That shows 15-17 (since 1N immediately would show 11-14). But it also is supposed to show a diamond stopper. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 1N is very imperfect which is why pass is fine. Also, instead of doubling West could have bid 2@C. But I like double better. If East jumps in a major then West can bid game.|

I think more than not play it as forcing. But I prefer it as not forcing.  Regardless, I can't play in 3@H.|

pc|DA|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally I don't like leading unprotected aces. But here, especially given the auction I think it is by far the best choice.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West clearly does not want to lead hearts, the suit bid by North. A spade lead from Qxx is dangerous and could easily give away a trick. West could lead a club as a safe lead. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But since East bid diamonds, in this case leading the @DA is far more likely to work well than when you lead an unprotected ace in an unbid suit. It is likely to let East-West take all of the diamond tricks they are entitled to before South has a chance to discard losing diamonds on a side suit.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I was very lucky. But good declarers make their own luck. It takes KJx of hearts in order for me not to go down. BTW, North should pass the 3@C which is easy to make. However, 4@C is not.|
