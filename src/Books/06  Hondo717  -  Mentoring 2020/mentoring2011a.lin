Personally I am not a big fan of Drury so I would bid 2@C with the East hand. But those who play Druy don't have 2@C available as a natural bid. In that case, I think 2N as showing a balanced 11-12 is pretty reasonable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Any bid you make now is forcing. There is an important bidding principle here. If you bid over an invitation, that establlishes a game force. So any bid over 2N is game forcing.|

up|24|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a good contract. As I mentioned, so long as you play that bids over invitational bids (in particular a 2N invite) are forcing, which you should, that allows you to find the best game.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is more important to be able to explore for game than to find the best partial. So if you play that, then I think West's best action is 3@H. That allows you to figure out what game is best - 4@S (as on this hand), 4@H, or 3N.|

mb|1N|mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss what East should do. In general if it goes 1N-P-P, you should definitely try to balance if you can.

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the balance did not work out. But you still should be aggressive. In this case there were a couple of reasons why balancing was more dangerous.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A) only a 5-card suit, b) a flat hand, and c) vulnerable against not. Therefore, pass instead of 2@S would have been reasonable as well.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in general balancing will work out much more often than not. Further, North should not bid 2N. There was a good chance East is going down. And since East is vul, if down 1 probably a push, if down 2 we do well, and down 3 is a really good result.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a non expert defense East probably does not go down 3. And unless you are playing against experts, you often get less than perfect defense.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other problem West has is if he bids 4NT his diamond void is an issue when East shows 1 key card, West won't know whether it is the @DA or @SK.

That is |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=superaccepts,Super Accept^*N|CP||FP||at| showing 4 hearts. Some play it also shows a maxmum NT along with the transfered major. But I will bid it whenever I have 4 unless I have a really bad 15 HCP.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is another more sophisticated super accept system where you bid a a doubleton. With a doubleton clubs for example, West bid 3@C showing a doubleton club and 4 hearts. With no doubleton West bid 3@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With some luck West played the hearts well and made the contract. Missing the @H10 playing the @HA first just about guarantees 1 heart loser at most. If West takes the heart finesse, he ends up losing an extra heart.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, the heart play was actually wrong in the context of the hand. West had to play the hearts to lose no heart tricks since West had one club and two diamond loser. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way to do that is to take the heart finesse and hope that South has Kx of hearts or Kxx and North has singleton @H10. So on this hand West made the hand where most experts would go down.|
