up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out declarer can make the hand taking 5 spades, 1 diamond, 1 club, and 1 heart at least. So let's talk about some alternative lines. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ducking the @DK on the first trick is sometimes right when declarer holds the @DJ because it prevents North from leading a 2nd diamond. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they do, it gives away a trick. However, on this hand there is no need to do so because West owns the @D10 as well. So West might win the @DA and play a club right away hoping for either a club trick with the @CK or a ruff and that makes the hand easy as it turns out.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Technically West is too strong for 3N but I like the bid. 3NT is the most practical bid here. Sure they might miss slam in a red suit, especially hearts. But particuarly given East is a passed hand 3N rates to be a good contract and 6 is not that likely.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As usual, when someone preempts, you have to improvise sometimes. A double instead of 3N is possible, but it takes you past 3N. And if partner bids clubs West would not happy.|
