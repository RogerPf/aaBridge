mb|3S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S here should be considered a strong raise. Obviously I have more than a limit since I am forcing to game. I am a bit worried we might miss slam.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, a good rule to follow is, when there is a preempt, worry about getting to the best game and don't worry if you miss a possible slam. Most of the time you don't have slam and you will do worse if you bid an unmakeable slam.|

pg| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Apparently, North is trying for a slam. Although it is possible, I think it is somewhat aggressive. North has very poor hearts and could easily have a heart loser. Further, the @SK, although it prevents them from taking 2 spades off the top, does not fit well with my hand.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, 4@D is a control bid, showing 1st or 2nd round control in diamonds and no control in clubs. But North has a club control (a void which is a 1st round control) so the correct control bid is 4@C.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It also does not keep with the principle I just stated of not worrying too much about slam. If North had the same hand except a void in spades instead of clubs, then I think a slam try is very warranted because the spade void would be huge. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H is the best bid for North. So let me give North an undo.|

If you change North's hand to be the same 5-5-3 but with 3 clubs to the queen (e.g. one less HCP) and a void in spades then slam is a wonderful conract. She has fewer points but better location of the points.|

But a good principle to keep in mind is that, if it goes 1N-P-P, you should strain to balance. If you play DONT, you should bid with any hand that is 5-4, 5-5 or has a 6-card suit even if it is weak. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, although this may sound counter intuitive, it is preferable that it is weak. Why? |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Beacuse, the points are approximately even between the 2 sides. So if the balancing hand is weak, most of their side's assets are after the NT bidder. That means finesses will tend to work. That is much better than if most of your side's assets were before the NT bidder.|

However, there are some tactical considerations North should think about. It is very likely EW have a major suit fit (or even fits in both majors) and we are not vul and they are.

When you play Checkback, 2@C over 1N and 3@C over 2N always asks about majors even if opener started with 1@C. On this hand 3@C is the same whether you play Checkback or New Minor Forcing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the responses are slightly different. You bid 2@D (or 3@D over 3@C) with no major. The point count is same as New Minor Forcing, invitational over 1NT, game force over 2NT.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other question is, what do you respond over either New Minor Forcing or Checkback with 3 hearts and 4 spades. Or to put it more generally 3 card support for responder's major and 4 cards in the other major.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a matter of agreement. I prefer you show 3 card support. But if you wanted to play you show the 4 card major that is fine. You and your partner just have to agree.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite what some teach, 5-3 fits are generally better than 4-4 fits for a couple of reasons although it is true that sometimes when you play in a 4-4 fit, you can use the 5-card suit to discard losers.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main argument against is that it is safer to play with a 5-card trump suit than a 4-card trump suit. You handle bad breaks better, and, as on this hand, if you are short in a suit and need to ruff, you don't run out of trump prematurely.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I were in spades, with only 4 spades and the 4-1 break, it would have been much more difficult.|
