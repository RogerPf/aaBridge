mb|P|mb|1D?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, because I don't have clubs, I can't make a takeout double. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But what if the opening bid was 1@C.|ub||ub||mb|1c?|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is should I make a takeout double or overcall 1@H? As a general rule, when 5-4 in the majors I prefer to overcall rather than doubling. I think getting across your 5-card length is very important.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only exception would be if my 5-card suit were weak and 4-card suit were strong. Then I might double. On this hand (assuming a 1@C opener) I definitely would not double, particularly since my hearts are so much better than my spades. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us go back to 1@D opener and I bid 1@H.|

mb|1S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't dislike 1NT but I think I would probably pass with the North hand.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East has a problem. When East bids 2@C, that strongly implies 5+ diamonds and 4+ clubs. West might take a preference to 2@D with a doubleton diamond. I probably pass as the hand could easily be a misfit (since I have a singleton in partner's suit and 4 cards in the opponent's suit). |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2@C could end up causing a problem and West might compete to 3@D with 3-card support. On this hand it does work out.|

PG| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I don't want to lead a heart (leading unprotected aces is a bad idea) and they bid the other 2 suits. So by default I will lead a trump.|pc|C5|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good play. Declarer should not take the heart finesse, even in Matchh Points. Based on the auction it is very likely to lose. Declarer always makes 3. However, it is easy for the defense to misdiscard, as they did here, and give away an overtrick or two.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West could have made it easier for East by taking the @CA right away and East could have figured out to save 2 clubs and throw away the @SQ. If North had the @CA or @SK they would have cashed it.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East can figure out partner has both of those cards. Here it was only an overtrick. But on other hands it might be the difference between making and not. Defense is very hard and requires a lot of difficult deductive reasoning.|

mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For a number of reasons, 4@S is a great bid. The most important reason is the following very important bidding principle. When you are in a competitive auction where your side has spades and their side has hearts. If you have a 9+ card fit in spades, 4@S over 4@H is correct 99% of the time,|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is either making or it will be a good sacrifice. In addition on this hand, NS is not vul and EW is vul, another good reason to sacrifice.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding principle still holds, although rarely you might not bid 4@S over 4@H if you have a balanced hand, But if you always bid 4@S over 4@H you will be right virtually all of the time.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it turns out we are down 1 in 4@S. 5 level decisions in bridge in competitive auctions are one of the most difficult. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a saying that "the 5 level belongs to the opponents" and it is true more often than not. What that means is that it is rarely right for you to bid "5 over 5."|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in this case, the opponents were at the 4 level. So West's decision was more difficult, particularly considering the vulnerability. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, with West's flat hand and 2 sure spade tricks (which did not mesh well with partner's suits) there is no guarantee that 5@H is making. And it is likely although far from certain that 4@S is going down. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They are pretty equivalent.

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me explain about why the @CJ was not the best play at trick eight. As a general rule, when taking a finesse, if you have a choice between leading an honor or leading towards an honor you should lead towards an honor.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you lead the honor and it is covered, then it takes 2 honors of yours to take care of one honor of theirs. If West also had the @C10 leading the @CJ is fine. But West did not.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And also think about the auction. South showed hearts and diamonds and was therefore short in clubs. If North had the @CK (very possible) then it doesn't matter. But if South had the @CK it must be either singleton or doubleton.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, leading low towards the @CQ is the only way to make the hand when South has the @CK.|

Here the @H10 seems reasonable. Admittedly leading an unprotected ace in partner's suit ls less bad than leading it in an unbid suit.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if North led the @CA followed by a low club I would assume a doubleton which is not great either.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out 2@S is a better spot. But there is no way to get there. And most importantly the hand looks like a misfit. East has clubs with South and a void in partner's diamonds. When the hand is a misfit you want to stop bidding ASAP.|

mb|1S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear what I should bid here. If East opened 1@C or 1@D I have a clear 2@H preemptive overcal. But over 1@S, 2@H is not preemptive. We are at favorable vulnerability (we are not vul, they are).|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And that even more strongly encourages very aggressive preempting. However, although I have 6 hearts my hand has a lot of negatives. It has no shortness (singleton or void). It has 3 cards in the opponents suit. That is an often overlooked negative.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the opponents bid a suit that has not been raised, having 3 cards in their suit is often a bad thing because it often results in 3 losers.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although I would bid 3@H if playing against a very strong pair: (you should be more aggressive, not less aggressive, against strong pairs). Here I am going to pass. If I bid 3@H, it would be harder to get to 4@S but they probably still get there.|mb|P|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East needed to think a little more carefully at trick one. I led the @D10. That means North holds the @DA and @DJ. I would not lead the @D10 holding either of those cards. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, declarer should play the @DK and plan on finessing against North's @DJ with the @D9. In that case declarer loses 1 spade, 1 club, and 1 diamond and makes the hand.|
