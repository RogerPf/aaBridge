up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think North needed a better plan, although it turns out, as the cards lie, the hand cannot be made. Here is a better line of play.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After ruffing the 2nd diamond, North should lead a low trump.  Why? Because North is in danger of losing 3 hearts. However, by leading a low trump immediately, that leaves a trump in dummy. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if East wins the @SQ and plays hearts, North can ruff the 3rd heart in dummy and end up only losing 2 hearts. On the actual hand, East should lead a spade after winning the @SQ. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer should now play the @DJ and discard a heart. Declarer is hoping that East either started with only 2 trump or 3 diamonds. Unfortunately, neither is the case, and East will ruff the @DJ.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming East now leads a heart, declarer will end up losing 1 spade, 2 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 club, and a  diamond ruff for down 1.

mb|3S|mb|P|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has a tough decison over 3@S. Pass is certainly reasonable. 4@S works out really badly here.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well you do need fast tricks to constructively raise to 4, so quick tricks a good indication of that and with only 1 spade, they only have an 8-card fit. With Kx of spades I would bid 4@S. But singleton @SK is problematical.|mb|P|

PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Knowing when to play aggressive defense vs passive defense is very important. You play aggressive defense when declarer has set up a suit and is ready to discard losers.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is actually a fairly common position. When you have trump length and a natural trump trick, you shouldn't overruff. So watch what happens.|

up|41|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So West has a pretty clear double. West has 3 likely tricks, 2 hearts and a diamond and partner doubled. Granted it was a balancing double so partner might be a little light. But East almost certainly has 1 trick at least.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should always consider doubling when you have trump length and strength particularly when you are behind the player who is long in trump.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had opened 4@H, which is possible, then it should go P-P and East should reopen with a double and West should pass. West should not double a 4@H opener. That is not penalty per se. It is just cards, and does not promise heart tricks. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When someone opens at the 4-level they have a good suit. So it is very unlikely that a defender also has length and strength in that suit. So a double is not penalty per se, just cards. Often it is passed out, but it doesn't have to be.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWhat does it mean to bid 4NT over opponent's 4@H opener?|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 4NT bid over 4@H shows the minors. Interestingly, if an opponent opens 4@S and you bid 4NT, that shows any 2 suits. Perhaps the minors or perhaps hearts and a minor. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So responder to the 4NT bid over 4@S can't bid 5@D unless they are willing to play 5@H. Partner bids 5@C if willing to play 5C or 5@D or partner bids 5@C if willing to play 5@C or 5 in either red suit.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if partner bids 5@C and the 4NT bidder has diamonds and hearts they pull 5@C to 5@D and the 5@C bidder either passes or corrects to 5@H. If partner bids 5@D over 4NT, then partner is saying they are willing to play in either 5@D or 5@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is more likely 3 spades since North has long hearts in which case East has to be worried about discards on clubs. So should shift to a diamond at trick 2 and hope that partner has a trump trick and they can get a diamond.|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general I am not a big fan of the modern theory of opening 1NT with non-classic distributions. I tend to prefer only having 1 doubleton at most (e.g. 5-3-3-2, 4-4-3-2, or 4-3-3-3). But I do make the following exceptions.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|a) if I have a so-so 6-card minor, not worth a jump to the 3-level, and 15-17, and 6-3-2-2 distribution, I will open 1NT.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|b) if I am 5-4-2-2 with a 5-card minor and 4 hearts, I will open 1NT if I feel my hand is not worth a reverse.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because if I open 1 of a minor and partner bids 1@S, I have no good rebid. This hand qualifies as b) and I will open 1NT as the least of evils although I wouldn't dislike it if you opened 1@C and, over 1@S, bid 2@C, 2@H or 3@C. But I prefer 1NT.|mb|1N|

It is not clear how to defend. I am worried about diamonds. Playing hearts could give away a trick. However, hearts offer the best shot at beating the hand.|pc|HA|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer should overtake the @H9 with the @HJ. Then lead a spade towards the @SKQ. If South started with the doubleton @SA, declarer will lose only 1 spade trick.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now declarer should lead a low spade, hoping for the doubleton @SA. On this hand that doesn't work, but it doesn't hurt to try for the lucky spade distribution. Good declarers make their own luck.|
