up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A hard hand to bid and play. West has no good bid over the double.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has several flawed choices. One is to bid 2@S as she did, knowing it is a 7 card fit. But @SQJx is good 3 card support. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another is to pass. But it is difficult to defend 1NT, particularly since East passed originally, meaning the points are about even between the 2 sides. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 3rd alternative is to bid 2N, but if you are going to do that, might as well pass 1N. So I think 2@S was a reasonable choice.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if I were North I would have passed 1@H. North doesn't really have 6 points. And Kx of hearts is decent heart support. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players would bid 1N but I don't see the point. It might get us too high when North has a weak hand and is officially one point shy of bidding 1N. On the other hand, it worked out okay on this hand.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is 12-14 balanced, presumably with a spade stopper on this auction.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points I might just pass 1N since bidding close games is not as important. I would bid 3N with the West hand with 13 HCP and a 5 card suit.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. As North, when in with @HA I probably lead a diamond  since I know a spade and a club both give away a trick. Further, West could have considered 3N. West showed 12-14 with the 1NT bid. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner is showing 11 or 12. And once partner invites, it is close to bidding 3N. With 13 HCP and a 5 card suit, I consider that closer to the top of your range than the bottom.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think passing 2N is terrible, just conservative. It turns out you were right. If we defend correctly you can't make 3N. But it also turns out that, unless you are playing against experts, players misdefend quite a bit which is why it pays to bid close games.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West chooses to lead a club, he must lead the @CA. You never lead away from an ace in a suit contract. The @CQ lead is incorrect, and, as you can see, it gives away a trick.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @CQ would have been fine in a NT contract but not in a spade contract. As West, I probably lead a heart. As it turns out, even with a heart lead, South can still make 6. He wins the heart and plays a low club.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West plays the @CA, then South can discard a spade on the @CK
and ends up just losing the @CA.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if West ducks the club, then South does not lose a club trick and just ends up losing a spade.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North/South SHOULD absolutely not be in slam. On a spade lead, they will end up losing a spade and a club.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And even on another lead, they will still lose either a spade or a club, and they rate to lose a heart trick most of the time. In fact, this heart distribution is the only distribution where they don't lose a heart.|
