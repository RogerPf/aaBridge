PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am assuming you would guess the spades wrong and lose a spade because the percentage play is to finesse the @SK.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, it does turn out that if East doesn't lead a club, 6@D goes down. I am not saying the club lead was wrong, just it didn't work out. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North plays clubs herself, the percentage line is to play for a 3-2 break. Since clubs break 4-1, East will lose a club trick. But once East leads a club, it is easy to play the suit in a way so as not to lose any tricks.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You lead low from 3 small and high from a doubleton. Therefore, here leading six of diamonds is never correct unless you play the silly leading convention  MUD @- Middle Up Down   which in my humble opinion is horrible.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is fourth best. Some experts play 3rd from a 4-card suit against suits, in which case you lead 3rd best.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NWhat is wrong with MUD?|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is the worst of both worlds (count vs. attitude). Partner can't tell until the 2nd round whether it is MUD or a doubleton. So just take a stance when leading an unbid suit with 3 small I prefer count. But if you want to lead attitude, lead top of nothing, some like that.|

mb|4H|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is possible, but West is a little light but the singleton heart is a good reason for the double. Double here is neither pure penalty nor pure takeout, It does not show hearts but it does show points.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear what East should do. East has 2 tricks and it is reasonable to count on the double for 2 tricks. From E/W calculation, 4@H is probably going down. The question is, can they make game--in particular 5@D. It is hard to know. So I think pass is East's best option.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After a 2NT overcall a raise of partner's suit shows a constructive raise (6-9). A bid of the other major is not forcing. It shows a 5+ card suit and an invitational hand (11 ish points).|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double says you are interested in penalizing at least one of the minors. And cue bids, both minors, are the most interesting.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A cue bid of clubs is about hearts (the lower major). And a cue bid of 3@D is about spades (the higher major).|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a reasonable line of play. Another possiblity, more risky, was not not draw the last trump and lead the @DA and a low diamond to give declarer an extra trick.|

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I would pass the North hand, it is much better than its 9 HCP indicate. It has 2 quality suits and all the points are in the two longest suits. Any hand with all their high cards in their long suits is worth an upgrade.|

mb|p3D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With no shortness you use "fast arrival" principles. You bid 4@S with a minimum opener, 3@S with 18+, and 3NT with 15-17 or so. So the higher the bid you make the weaker your hand is.|

West has the good @D10 and the @HK (based on the 3@H control bid). So if I duck the heart, I know what will happen is West will win the @HK and discard the @HQ on the @D10.|
