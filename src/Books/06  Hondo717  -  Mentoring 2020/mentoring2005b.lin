On the other hand, when the bidding starts 1 of a minor with a 1 spade response it is okay to bid 1N with a singleton spade if no better bid. |

That is why, when deciding whether or not to bid a close game the most important factor to consider is how many trump you have.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a 9-card fit you should bid close games. With an 8-card fit you should be much more cautious, especially when trumps are 4-4. 4-1 breaks, although not odds on, do occur almost 1/3 of the time. |

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually a 4-4 fit is not better than a 5-3 fit. A 5-3 fit is better because it is easier to handle a 4-1 break. Some people feel the 4-4 fit is better than the 5-3. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being that if you play in the 4-4 fit, you can use the 5-card suit for discards and admittedly sometimes you do get an extra trick in that case.|

However, it doesn't matter as partner has a clear 4@H bid. 3@H is NOT forcing. It is only invitational. Partner can and should pass unless he has at least 9 points (or a good 8).|
