up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand definitely needed planning. So how should the hand be played? One way to count tricks is to count 4 spades, 1 club, and 3 diamonds for 8 top tricks. A ruff in either hand makes 9 and you could hope that diamonds are 3-3 or the @DJ comes down in 2 rounds (50%) for your 10th trick.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other alternative is to try and ruff 2 clubs in your hand, as that would give you 6 spades, 3 diamonds and a club|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So after winning the first spade, declarer might try to play @CA and another club. When North wins she should play another spade. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Win in dummy and ruff a club. Lead a diamond to dummy and ruff another club. Lead a diamond to dummy, draw trump, and end up losing 2 hearts when diamonds don't break. That is probably the best line although the line West took was not bad either.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now what I like to play after doubles of 1NT is DONT runouts. Some only play them over a penalty double, but I like to play them over all doubles. They work as follows.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| If I redouble that shows a single suit (5+ cards). Partner bids 2@C and I pass or bid my suit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I bid a suit that shows that suit and a higher suit. I can be 4-4 (unlike regular DONT where I must be 5-4). |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I bid 2@C I have clubs and another suit. 2@D is diamonds and a major, 2@H is hearts, and spades. 2@S is natural and weaker than doubling and then bidding 2@S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand I am going to be preemptive and bid 2@S as a weakish bid with 5+ spades. If I have 4 spades and 4 diamonds I would bid 2@D.|mb|2S|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. One additional comment on the 1st heart trick. West should consider playing low. If partner doesn't have the @HK (as on this hand), by playing the @HA, West set up an extra heart trick for declarer. Generally aces are meant to capture other honors.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that East started with a doubleton diamond and will get a diamond ruff except dummy is also out of diamonds. So there is no advantage to taking the @HA.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against perfect defense North will make exactly 3 clubs. In IMPs the extra trick is irrelevant But in Match Points it is probably the difference between and average and below average board.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North were, for example, short in hearts, then 4@C would be reasonable. Also whenever you bid 4 of a minor in a hand where the opponents are bidding a major you must make the tactical consideration as to whether you will be happy if they bid 4 of their major.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, I don't think North will be happy in case it pushes East bids 4@H. That is another reason to not bid 4@C.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, I suspect East is bidding 4@H anyway. So North probably did not push them to 4@H. But it is something to consider.|
