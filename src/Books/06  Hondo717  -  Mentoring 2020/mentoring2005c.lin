PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a weak hand I transfer, as North did. With an invitational or game forcing hand I bid Stayman.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nIf East opened 3@C what should South bid?|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have bid 3NT which is a bit risky, and I would have worried about missing a major suit fit. Double here by South is a more ambiguous bid.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a choice between overcalling NT and making a takeout double, you should almost always choose the NT overcall.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over my 3NT North has 2 choices. Probably the best bid is 4@H, transfer to spades. And many people don't know this, but 4@C by North in this auction, where partner makes a strong 3NT overcall, is NOT Gerber. It is Stayman.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, if North transfers to spades, which I think is best, we end up in 4@S.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nHow many points are you showing with 3NT over 3@C?|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3NT shows a strong NT, 15-18. Although admittedly with some 15 point hands I might double or pass and with some 19 point hands I might bid 3N anyway.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, it is more likely spades is a better contract. And that is why you preempt because the opponents have to guess what to do and they often guess wrong.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if East opened 3@C, we end up in 4@S for down 1 or perhaps even in 4@H which is down a huge amount with the 5-0 break. One thing to keep in mind when there is a preempt you should be more reluctant to play in a 4-4 fit because the odds of a 4-1 break are much higher than normal.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally the odds of a 3-2 break are around 2/3 (68% actually). But after a preempt they probably go down to around 60% or even less.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*NBut wouldn't it push you to a making 4@S?|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For two reasons East is not correct. Here we don't make 4@S and if we do make 4@S, we are likely to be bidding it even without a preempt. So the preempt doesn't "push us" anywhere,|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are hands where we might end up bidding game after a preempt that we might not bid otherwise, but only rarely. But there are many more hands where we will end up in the wrong spot, not high enough, too high, or in the wrong suit.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now this is subtle but important point. I know that North has both the @HQ and @HA. North is leading a heart for me to possibly ruff. Whenever you lead back a suit for partner to ruff you try to lead back suit preference.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, in this case, leading the @HA and @HQ are equivalent in terms of their ability to take a trick. Therefore, which heart North chooses to lead back is suit preference.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lower honor (@HQ) means North wants a club back. The higher honor (which would be the correct play here) means North wants the higher ranking side suit, diamonds, back.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Our only hope was East started with 2 clubs. That was unlikely given the way he played the suit.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Futher, let's discuss the 3rd heart trick. That is what is called a "trump promotion". Normally, since I only have 4 spades to the 10 and East holds the AKQJ, I am not entitled to a spade trick.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But because North led back a 3rd heart she forced East to ruff high. If he ruffed low I was overruffing and therefore the 3rd heart back promoted my @S10 into a trump trick.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a common occurrence and one you should be aware of and do whenever possible.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is much better to compete over 1NT than leave the opponents to their own devices because 1NT is such a precise bid. Auctions that start with 1NT are usually very accurate. So anything you can do to disrupt the auction is a plus for you.|

mb|P|mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*nIs the 2@C bid considered a relay or Puppet?|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some call 2@C a "relay". But it doesn't matter what you call it. It just matters you know how DONT works. A double forces partner to bid 2@C and then the doubler passes with clubs or corrects to their suit.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes you want to lead unprotected aces in the middle of the hand when you know it won't cost a trick. For example, at trrick six I knew that leading the @SA doesn't cost a trick since dummy has no spade honors.|
