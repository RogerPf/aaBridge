up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have overcalled 1@S with the North hand, although pass is okay. Spades are not great. However nice to lay claim to spades in a competitive auction. Spades are obviously the best suit to hold since you can outbid your opponents at the same level.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And North should definitely bid 2@S in the pass out seat. Forcing the opponents play at the 2 level in an 8 card fit when the points are evenly distributed is usually going to be at best an average result and often below average. You should never let your opponents play at the 2 level when they have a fit.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to look at the entirety of the points you and your partner have. Assuming you are playing against competent opponents, if they voluntarily stop at the 2-level then presumably the points are approximately evenly distributed between the 2 sides. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So even if you are slightly weak, that means partner must have some points. Although the play is tricky, it looks like we make 2@S. So in IMPs we broke even. In Match Points we probably are slightly below average although probably not terrible.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NRight. But shouldn't we take vulnerability into consideration in those cases?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At the 2 level not so much. Although admittedly on this hand, since down 2, -200 is not as good as our side making a partial if EW vulnerable. However, in general at the 2 level, you should consider yourself lucky to set them 1 trick.|

PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to points, it depends on your distribution. With 5-4-2-2 probably at least 9 or so. But with 5-4-3-1 particularly if your high cards are in your long suit can be a lttle less. And with 5-5 you need very little.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember most players over value HCP and undervalue distribution. On most hands, distribution is much more important than HCP, especially when you have a very distributional hand.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would rather have an 8 HCP hand with at least 10 or 11 cards in 2 suits than a strong NT.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As responder I have the following options. With at least 3 diamonds I pass. Otherwise, I bid 2@H which North would pass if they had hearts and correct to 2@S if they had spades.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us go back and discuss the 2@D bid by North. It is fine but I might very well bid 3@D and not worry about a heart fit. Whenever you have a 6-card suit, it is very likely that is the suit you want to play even if 6-4.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 6-5 it is possible hearts are better than diamonds. But even then diamonds are probably fine. As I said I would bid 3@D.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you gave North 6 hearts and 5 diamonds and the same hand I would bid it as follows.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would make a DONT double showing a 1 suited hand and after partner bid the required 2@C bid asking North to pass or correct to their suit I would jump to 3@H.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, on this hand, since North bid 2@D I as South with 3 diamonds can pass.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the best line of play. The 4-0 diamond break is admittedly very unlucky. But, a better plan is to try and ruff some hearts.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So after winning the @CK I would not touch trump for a bit. I would play 2 more rounds of clubs discarding a heart. And then lead a low heart and insert the @H10. When that loses, ruff whatever comes back.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then play the @DA and plan on ruffing 2 hearts in dummy. As it turns out that line makes 3 (losing 3 diamonds and 1 heart). But the point here, as in the last hand is that you often delay drawing trump when you need to ruff things in dummy.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"Lose your losers early", is a good thought. I am not saying never draw trump first. In fact sometimes that is a good idea, especially with a 9+ card fit. But if you need to ruff in the short hand, it is usually correct to delay drawing trump until you get your ruffs.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree 100% with opening 1@D, although in modern bridge many would open 1NT despite 5-4-2-2. The recent trend is to open 1NT with anything that resembles a "balanced" hand. In fact, the ACBL lets you open 1NT with a singleton if it is the ace or king, or queen.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't like that. The whole point about 1NT is it is a very specific bid and once you distort your distribution you destroy bidding accuracy.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, suppose you open 1NT with a singleton and partner with a 6 card suit assumes you have an 8+ card fit. That might not work out too well.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to pass. But if I switch my hearts and spades (e.g. had 10xxxx in spades and Axx in hearts), I would overcall 1@S. It gets in the opponents way and makes it easier for partner to compete.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I overcall with spades and not hearts is 1@H does not preclude a 1@S bid by responder. But 1@S forces them to the 2 level in hearts (or any other suit).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, as the kibs can see, although I have a clear 4@S bid with my hand, because I have 18 HCP, 1 length point, and 1 quality suit point for 20, 4@S with the horrendous break is going to work out very badly.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was lucky to only go down 3. The bidding was fine although as I said the 2@S bid was a bit of a stretch. Personally with only 5 HCP and 4-3-3-3 distribution I would have passed. |
