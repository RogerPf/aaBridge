up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A bit unlucky. It turns out, with hearts 3-3 we can make 5 hearts and 3 spades in NT plus probably a minor suit trick. We can actually make 3N. So if I bid 2N we make 3 most likely.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also note that the 2nd diamond ruff (where declarer ruffed with the @SQ--trick 6) promoted a 2nd trump trick for West. That is known as a 'trump promotion' play and comes up a fair amount.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Never be afraid to give dummy a ruff especially if you know partner is out also. Some players are reluctant to give declarer a ruff but you should never be afraid to do so. At worst that is a neutral play. And often it either shortens declarer trumps or promotes a trump in partner's hand.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There was nothing North could do to prevent West from winning a 2nd trump trick.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, if I bid 2N over 2@D, North has a clear raise to 3N having the best hand they could have, 14 HCP and a 5 card suit. With more they usually open 1N.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1H|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is a good bid though you hate to give up finding a spade fit. However, if East doubles and West bids clubs, East is in trouble. The East hand is not quite strong enough, and her diamond suit is not good enough, to double and correct to 2@D over 2@C.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think 2@D is the best choice, giving up on spades reluctantly.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some experts play something called "Equal Level Conversion Doubles--ELCD" these days and that works well on this hand. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In ELCD, you double and partner bids a suit. If you correct to a different suit at the same level (and the remaining suit is still at the same level) that is not a "double and correct" showing a strong hand it just shows a 2 suited hand.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That type of equal level conversion double works well when you are short in clubs, as on this hand. But I don't particularly like it and don't recommend you play it.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWouldn't a double by East suggest shortness in hearts and 3-4 in the other suits asking partner to bid his best suit?|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, in general the double would promise clubs but if you double and correct that just shows a good hand (16+) and a long strong suit.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East is close to a double and correct, but I think she is slightly too weak and her suit is not quite good enough which is why I think 2@D is better.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I could make a negative double here. But my hand has many flaws. I have a singleton in partner's suit. I only have 5 HCP. My spades are not too good and I have 3 diamonds. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing to note is that 3 small cards in the opponent's suit is the worst holding you can have. A little known but important factor when bidding in a competitive auction. So pass is my bid |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, partner is also not likely to have the @SA so a spade lead followed by a club switch might not work either. Another possibility is 4@H.

mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is the issue with the North hand. If you choose to open 1@C, which is possible you should expect a 1@S bid by partner. Then you must be willing to rebid 1NT with a singleton spade which is possible.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you open 1@D and partner responds 1@S you could rebid 2@C.But that generally shows 5 diamonds and 4+ clubs. So I think 1@C followed by 1N is fine.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand illustrates the power of highly distributional hands. They are worth so much more than their HCP. In fact I would rather have a 5-5 or 6-5 hand with 9-10 points than a 14 or 15 point balanced hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NIs a club lead a reasonable opening lead?|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A club is fine and could work well. However, although you usually don't lead an opponent's suit, in this case, you could make a case for leading a diamond. It is likely I don't have that many diamonds and if partner has 1 diamond honor it could work really well. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But a club is the more standard and less risky lead. To repeat  myself, as you will see, this is an unusual case where a diamond might work, but with West's nice club spots I think a club is better.|
