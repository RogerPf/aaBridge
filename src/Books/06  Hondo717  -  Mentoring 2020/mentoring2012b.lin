First, it is a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=splinters,Splinter Bid^*N|CP||FP||at|, showing 4 hearts, a singleton diamond, and a game forcing hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North does have 4 hearts and a singleton diamond. However, in order to have a game forcing hand he needs at least 19 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Bergen Dummy Points ^*N|CP||FP||at| or so. North's Dummy Points are only 17. They are 14 HCP and 3 for singleton with 4 trump. So the hand is not really quite strong enough to make a game forcing bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 3@H is the correct bid. Some might only bid 2@H, which is a slight underbid but not horrible either. 3@H shows 17-19 Dummy Points. However, the 4@D bid is not going to make any difference as how I would bid my hand.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I have 11 HCP and might normally consider slam because the @DQ must be downgraded as it is not a useful card when partner has a singleton I will not consider slam.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The ideal holdings in a suit where partner splinters are 3 or more small or 3 or more to the ace. If I discount the @DQ I only have 9 HCP and no declarer add ons. That is not enough to try for slam.|

pc|H4|sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A trump is often a good lead after a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=splinters,Splinter^*N|CP||FP||at|. Let's count my tricks. Assuming hearts are 3-2, I have 4 hearts, can probably manage 2 diamond ruffs for 6, a diamond is 7, a spade is 8, and a club is 9.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have several choices for a 10th trick. I can take the diamond finesse, but then I might get only 1 diamond ruff. I can hope the @SA is onside and perhaps clubs are 3-3. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I also need to count losers. If I take the diamond finesse and it loses, I will lose 2 clubs 1 spade and 1 diamond not to mention I might only get 1 diamond ruff.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So my best shot is to try for the @SA onside or hope clubs are 3-3.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why 4@D was a bit of an overbid. But even if North bids 3@H we get to 4@H.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is not an easy hand although with clubs behaving so nicely it turned out to be relatively easy. My only other comment is a minor one. When West is in with the @SJ, second trick, he might consider what is called a "passive" defense.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although given his nice clubs a club back is reasonable. But if he wanted to lead back a heart, that would not give anything away. However, if his partner had as little as the @C10 the club back is a nice lead. |

mb|1D|mb|P|MB|3C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C is definitely incorrect. These days most play weak jump shifts. So 3@C would be weak. But even if you play strong jump shifts the East hand is much too weak to make a jump shift.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need a slam invitational hand at least playing strong jump shifts.

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is okay with the North hand but it does meet the rule of 20 if you don't downgrade the queen doubleton in diamonds. I would open 1@C but many would pass (probably even Bergen would in 1st seat).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N is wrong because the bid it is too weak. North has a game forcing hand. Further, North wants to explore for a major suit fit. The best bid is 3@D. A cue bid here is defined as Stayman.|

mb|3N|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I know that partner has 4 spades because of the 3@D Stayman bid. So I will correct to 4@S.|

pc|C6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good lead. It is possible West did not have a diamond holding that he wishes to lead away from and was just leading a club as a neutral lead. On the other hand, given the DONT bid, it is likely West is short in clubs and will ruff this.|

pc|HQ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now this is where a declarer needs to plan. Clubs are running if I unblock the suit. And unless West started with 5 spades (unlikely) I can draw trump, play the @CJ and lead a heart to the king to run clubs. So I need to win this in my hand to preserve the @HK as an entry.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, I can also get to dummy with a heart ruff. So it doesn't really matter where I win the heart. But on other hands, it might make a difference. |

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Managing entries can be tricky, particularly when you have blocked suits. This is another area where many players have a blind spot. So when counting how many trump are remaining in defenders' hands, don't forget about ruffs.|

mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is fine particularly at this vulnerability. But when preempting with a freak hand (meaning at least 11 cards in 2 suits), as a good rule you usually should preempt one level higher than what the length of your long suit dictates.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is why, a couple of hands ago, when I had seven spades and four hearts. I said I would bid 4@S rather than 3@S. So East preempt bid should have been 3@S.|
