up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Often when you open 2@C with a long minor, you rebid 2N rather than bidding your minor. Admittedly it is a little scary to rebid 2N with no spade stopper. But 3@C gets the auction too high. So 2N by West was better than 3@C over 2@D. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's transfer was fine. But then East should bid 3N rather than 4@S. West can correct to 4@S with 3 spades. As it turns out, North will likely lead a club and 3N makes since West can take 5 club tricks, 1 spade at least, 2 hearts and a diamond. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a diamond lead 3N does go down but no reason for North to lead a diamond. And, in fact, would have to lead the @D10 to unblock the suit, which is not happening.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, West should win the first club trick in her hand and lead a spade towards the KQ. Unless North plays the @SA and gives me a ruff which is not likely then West will lose 2 spades and a diamond and make 4@S. Once again you need to plan the play before you play from dummy.|

mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is a limit raise in spades NOT a stopper ask. Some might think 3@H is a stopper ask. But the rule about a cue bid showing a limit+ raise works as follows. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the first non-pass bid by responder or advancer (responder to an overcaller) is a cue bid, it shows a limit+ raise. A cue bid is only a stopper asking bid on subsequent bidding rounds.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with the 3@S bid, the @HQ looks like a bad card based on the auction. So East only has 12 working HCP and a flat hand. Personally in IMPs I would bid 4@S with the West hand. The hand is worth 12 Dummy Points and they have a 9 card fit. So you stretch in IMPs to bid vulnerable games and with 9 card fits. However, it turns out West was smarter than me on this hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason you play that is because then, if you lead the jack, partner knows you have nothing higher.

It is clear 1@C opening bid. Not to mention 2.5 quick tricks which is nice. |

mb|1C|mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days, it is okay to make slightly light takeout doubles with nice distribution. A takeout double is supposed to show an opener. But with good distribution (and I have perfect distribution for a takeout double) you can double with slightly less than an opener.|

But most players use new |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=nmf,New Minor Forcing^*N|CP||FP||at| and on this hand it really doesn't matter.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally you would not lead a suit that declarer bid. But if you have a 4 or 5 card suit where declarer is known to have only 4 and your suit includes 2 honors it sometimes works out to lead the suit. In this case it happens to work very well. So I am leading a heart.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North defended correctly. So declarer needs to plan the hand out. Declarer starts with 6 sure tricks after the heart lead--1 heart, 3 clubs, and 2 diamonds. If I have the @SA that is another 2 tricks. And the diamond finesse is the 9th trick. But it is hard to handle everything.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|therefore, after winning the @HK I would lead a spade. When that wins, I would cash the @CK and lead a diamond to the @DK. Next I cash the @CA and @CQ. And then I play another spade. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I duck it is not clear what to play. But if you choose the @SK, it works well. So probably not making but it might.|
