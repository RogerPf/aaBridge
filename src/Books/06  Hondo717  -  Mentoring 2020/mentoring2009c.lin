nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually, there is a slightly better line of play based on the auction. South is known to be short in clubs (since the Michaels bid showed 5-5 in the majors).

mb|P|mb|P|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need strain to open in 3rd seat, particularly preempting. On average, after 2 passes the 1st two seats average around 16 HCP which means that 3rd and 4th seat average around 24. Since since I have 7 it is likely West is pretty strong, 16 or 17. It turns out slightly less on this hand but still a good hand. Therefore, I should strain to preempt.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, we are at "unfavorable vulnerability", meaning we are vulnerable and they are not which makes it a bit more dangerous to prempt. At any other vulnerability, I would open 2@S in 3rd seat only. Even here I am tempted. However, I will make it easier on West by passing.|mb|p|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you learn one thing about bidding all year, please learn Bergen Hand Evaluation. There are tutorials on my website. Bergen Hand Evaluation is much more valuable than learning some complicated convention because you use it on every hand and it will make you a much more accurate bidder.|

lb|*mWhich suit should North lead from?^Spades~Hearts~Clubs~Didamonds^2|


cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should lead a heart. Leading an unprotected ace, diamonds or clubs, is almost never right. Leading away from a king, spades, can work but is also dangerous. It happens to work here but a heart is the safest lead.|

up|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see, Bergen Hand Evaluation works well. Since most players over rely on HCP, most EW players would not bid game on 22 HCP. But if you learn Bergen Hand Evauation, you will outbid most pairs. That is the easiest way for you to improve your results.|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd or 4th seat, I would consider opening 4@H as that is often going to be our best contract and it makes it hard on the opponents. Hands with voids are wonderful and 6-4 hands are also wonderful. Notice how I am talking about distribution, not HCP.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you learn one thing from today's lesson, it is that you should love distributional hands regardless of their HCP. But here we might have slam so I will start with 1@H.|mb|1H|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*mWhich one would be a good bid for North?^2N~1S~2D^3|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2NT is Jacoby, showing 4 hearts and game forcing hand. 1@S is what most players would bid and that is fine. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But a good way to play 2 over 1 game forcing is to play that with a game forcing hand over 1@H. If you have 4 spades and a 4 card minor bid 2 of the minor to establish a game force.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner has spades, he will bid them. 2@D is not standard but it is a good treatment to play if you agree with your partner to play that.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


mb|2D|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2H|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 2@H to show a 6th heart. The question is, what should North bid over 2@H. Clearly North wants to raise but you must understand the principle of "fast arrival". A 4@H bid is WEAKER than a 3@H bid because we are in game forcing auction.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With no interest in slam (e.g. a min game force) North bids 4@H. But with some slam interest North bids 3@H. That gives us more room to explore for slam. That is one of the great advantages of 2/1 Game Force.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us count North's |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Bergen Dummy Points ^*N|CP||FP||at| to see whether North should bid 3@H or 4@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 14 HCP, -1 for dubious KJ doubleton in clubs, +1 for quality diamond suit which is a weakish Game Force. Therefore, I would bid 4@H "fast arrival" with the North hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 11 HCP, plus 2 length points, 1 quality suit point, 4 points for the void normally [however, given it is partner's suit it is not quite as valuable but let's leave that be for now], 1 extra point for 6th heart once a fit is found, and 1 point for side club suit for 20 Bergen Declarer Points.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally that is enough to try for slam. But diamond void is questionable. And given North's fast arrival, I will pass, but I would not be surprised if we made slam.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


mb|p|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, you should avoid bidding questionable slams because it is too risky if most of the field is not bidding them.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWhy one point for the 4-card side suit?|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The extra declarer point for a 4-card side suit is part of Bergen Hand Evaluation. The 4th card is often worth an extra trick.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BAnother Kib: ^*NShould it be a minus for the lousy spades?|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, 3 small is a very bad holding unless partner is short. So it's something to consider as a minus when trying to decide whether or not to be aggressive.|
