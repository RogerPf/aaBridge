mb|1S|mb|D?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if I bid, it is known as a "free bid" because I can pass and partner still gets a chance. Some people feel you should only make a free bid with extra values. But that is not really true.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should make a bid if you have something to say that partner will find useful. You might pass with a very minimum flat hand and cannot raise partner.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not to mention over a double, unless you redouble, all 2 level bids just show a long suit and less than 10 points. All 2 level bids over a double are in fact to play normally and definitely not forcing.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|1n|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I am going to bid 1N. My 1NT bid does show a bit extra. I would not bid 1NT with 6 or a mediocre 7. 1NT shows 8-10 or so and could be done with a nice 7. So in this case it does show a little extra.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, even playing 1N forcing, 1N here is definitely not forcing.|

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East is basically correct. My minimum point count for a 1N response after the takeout double is 8-10. Sometimes I do it with a nice 7.|

In general the length of your suit determines how high to preempt. With my hand, most players would open 2@D and that would not be wrong.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1. We are not vul and they are vul. That is called "favorable vulnerability" and means that you should be especially aggressive when preempting.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |

PG| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you have additional chances. North played for 3-3 hearts as his 12th trick or a squeeze. So that ups the percentage quite a bit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another alternative is to play @HA, @HK and a low heart right away. That is probably best, as it will pretty much make even if hearts are 4-2 as they are.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And depending on how declarer plays hearts, because of @HQ10 doubleton and our side having the @H987 we might be able to manage a 3rd heart for our 9th trick. But still not as good as +150.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Turns out we don't do well in 5@C because of the 4-0 break. A slightly better way to play the hand is to try for a 3-3 diamond break for an extra trick. However, it turns out they are 4-2 so only make 4 anyway.|
