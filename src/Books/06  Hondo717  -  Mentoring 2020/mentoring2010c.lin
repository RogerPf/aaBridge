With a limit raise, East would cue bid 2@H. East is close to a limit raise but the jacks in the minors need to be discounted.|

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a raise of partner with usually 4 card support (sometimes 3-card support) and with 10+ points. East only has 9 points which is why, rather than bidding 2@H which would show a limit raise, East bid 3@S which shows less than a limit raise with 4 card support.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I just noticed that West overcalled with a 4-card suit. I don't agree with that. Some people have begun to make 1 level overcalls with 4 card suits but usually they have a better suit (3 honors) and I don't like it because it messes up your |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| calculations as it did here.|

It is similar. Over 1NT if West bids 2@C, that is asking East about their major. That is true whether or not East opened 1@C.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 4 hearts East would bid 2@H. With 3 spades East would bid 2@S. And with neither East would bid 2@D (just like in regular Stayman). |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I prefer Checkback is that it keeps the auction lower when there is no fit which makes it easier for East, for example to make a 2 level bid and play there. Any convention which keeps the bidding at a lower level has an advantage. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I think 1NT is the standout response. West might only have 4 spades.

mb|3D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D by North is reasonable although technically it is a 1@D opener. I probably open 1@D because there is a chance we have a heart fit or possibly 3NT despite the void.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D worked out so so. E/W probably end up in a heart partial if North opens 1@D although we may end up in 3@D anyway. West could consider doubling in balancing seat.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can't make the contract. You are lucky to go down 1.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players would double with the West hand. And if West doubles over 3@D, it works out very badly for EW. That is why you preempt. You make the opponents guess, and they often guess wrong.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here West guessed right by passing but there are many hands where doubling would have worked better.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few people play what is called a "thrump double" over 3 level preempts. It means you want partner to bid 3NT with a stopper in the preempter's suit. That would work well here.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't play double by North as card showing, and many people don't, then the 3@S bid by west would have been even more effective. We could have easily ended up in a club or diamond partial.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some players would bid 4@C with the North hand or perhaps 4@D. 5@C does make.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is correct. 4@S is down 1. It is very unusual for a vulnerable sacrifice to be correct over non vulnerable opponents because you have to be down exactly 1 for it to be correct.|
