mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should bid 4@H denying a diamond control. Because if I don't have a diamond control, we don't want to get too high. 4@H does not deny nice spades. It simply says North does not have a diamond control. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a more flexible bid. In general, when you have a choice of 2 bids, you should choose the lower bid unless the higher bid is a lot better.|mb|4H|
