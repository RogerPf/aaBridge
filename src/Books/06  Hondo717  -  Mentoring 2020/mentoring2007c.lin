nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To summarize, each suit starts with 3 losers. If you have an ace, king, or queen in the suit that eliminates a loser. Also shortness eliminates a loser, so a doubleton suit has at most 2 losers. Hands with 7 losers are ostensibly openers.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the West hand has 1 spade loser, 2 heart losers, 1 club loser, and 3 diamond losers for a total of 7. But here is a good example why that is inaccurate. Change the @HA to the @HQ. That is still a 7 loser hand, and not close to an opener.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S was fine, 50% contract, should be bid in IMPs and even okay in Match Points. In fact, it is actually slightly better than 50% because West opened. Therefore, West has the majority of the HCP and so slighlty more likely West has the @SK than East.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North had a sure heart loser. So the only chance is if the spade finesse works or East has a singleton @SK. So the best play, at trick four, was to play a low heart to the @HJ. If that loses, then win the return and play the @HQ overtaking with the @HK and take the spade finesse.|

Even if you play new suits are forcing over a weak-2, (which most players do play, although I don't), they are not forcing after a double. So you can bid 3@D, if you like, and not worry that I will think you are strong.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. But as you can see 4@H is much easier. As a general rule, when you have a 5 card major and a choice of doubling or overcalling, overcalling is better unless your 5 card major is very weak.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A Kib asked what does an opening "2-bid" in 4th seat show? Well it clearly should not be preemptive. It is not a Weak-2 bid since the idea behind a preempt is to make it hard for the opponents to find a good contract.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 4th seat, the opponents have not found any contract, so there is no point in giving them another chance to do so when you are weak. Therefore, an opening 2 bid in 4th seat is played by most experts with a nice 6-card suit, usually with 3 honors and a weakish opener, say 10-14 HCP.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea being you want to play in your nice 6 card suit probably and you want to make it hard for the opponents to compete. That gives partner a good picture of your hand.|

up|48|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to play. The line was reasonable. But another possibility is to simply play West for the @CJ. After the lead, North has 3 spades, 2 hearts, and 2 diamonds off the top. So needs 2 tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given the limited entries to dummy, I probably just hope that West has the @CJ. And after winning the 1st spade, I play the @CK (or Q) intending to get to dummy with one diamond and leading a club and finessing the @C10.|
