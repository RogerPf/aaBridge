mb|1S|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand does meet the rule of 20 (11 HCP and 9 cards in red suits). So it is a Game Force, although a minimum. However, when you have long hearts and partner opens 1@S you should sometimes slightly stretch to bid 2@H even if not quite a Game Force. Otherwise, you could lose the heart suit.|mb|2H|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's an interesting bid by North. It has a very specific meaning. It says "partner I am setting spades as trump". "I have a one loser suit even if you have a singleton please start control bidding if at all interested in slam."|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note it DOES NOT say that North has 16-18 with nice spades. There is no reason to jump, and in fact you should refrain from doing so once a GF is established unless you have a very specific reason to do so. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2 reasons to jump on this auction are the one North choose (self sufficient suit) or if North had heart support and a singleton somewhere (then North could splinter). Otherwise, you should go slow. That is the whole point of 2/1 to allow you to go slow to find the best game or slam.|

mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 2@S is overly aggressive here particularly at unfavorable vulnerability with  2 quacks and bad support (3 little). However, it does give East a bit of a problem.|

up|28|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, no matter how I defend, probably down 1. But that shouldn't prevent you from analyzing the defense for every hand. Most people try to play "passive" defense, meaning they try not to give away tricks and quite often that is a good way to defend.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But sometmes, particularly when you know declarer has long suit to run and get lots of discards you have to play "active" defense where you must be aggressive and set up tricks for yourself ASAP before the suit runs. That was the case on this hand.|

So with my nice 5-4-3-1 distribution, many players would open 2@S here.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I won't. And even if you play aggressive preempts and would open this hand 2@S in 1st seat you should not open it in 2nd seat because 2nd seat is the most risky seat to preempt.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is because it is much more likely, since 1st seat passed, that partner has a good hand and you end up preempting partner. I am not saying you shouldn't preempt in 2nd seat.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You absolutely should. But you should be more disciplined than in 1st or especially 3rd seat. BTW, if I held this hand in 3rd seat and it started pass-pass-? I would definitely open it 2@S.|mb|P|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


mb|1S|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is definitely the best bid. I said in Hand 1 that you should stretch to bid 2@H. But here, with a singleton in partner's suit, 5 so-so hearts, and Jxx of diamonds, it is not close to a stretch.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2@H bid by West is a pretty big underbid IMO. I think the hand is worth a 3@H call. With 4 quick tricks, 5-5, a quality heart suit, and a near quality spade suit, 3@H is pretty clear bid to me. Yes it could be a misfit, but you could play 4@H opposite a small doubleton.|

pc|CQ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @CQ is a good lead. If you choose to lead diamonds, you must lead the @DK. BTW, note that this is the 2nd time where the lead of K from KQ gives away a trick. Many teachers say that K from KQ is a good lead. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have found it often gives away a trick. I am, however, more inclined to lead it from KQ10 than from KQx. Further, on this auction, a trump would be reasonable.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Any time declarer bids 2 suits and dummy takes a preference a trump lead is often a good lead. Dummy is probably short in declarer's other suit and a trump lead cuts down on ruffs.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So this was a good slam and it is actually about 60% to make 7. If spades split 4-3 which is the most likely split, then West would make 7. If West bids 3@H rather than 2@H, will they get to slam? Hard to say but no chance with a 2@H bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You usually deduct one for dubious shortness such as a singleton queen but since West opened 1@S, no need to deduct. However, I won't give full credit for the singleton either.|

PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you should use "Bergen Adjusted Points" to see how many "HCP" East has. Using that method you can add one for the quality diamond suit meaning the hand is worth 12 points and meets the rule of 20.|mb|1D|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 3 reasonable choices here--1NT, 1@S and double. I try and bid NT whenever I can but here there are a couple of flaws. I don't have the right distribution and we could easily have a major suit fit.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I sometimes double one of a minor with the majors and only a doubleton in the other minor. I prefer not to do it.|

mb|1C|mb|1S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Inverted Raises are off. So if I bid 2@C that is simply a club raise with 6-9 and 4 clubs. You might worry about raising clubs when partner might have 3. But it turns out that overwhelmingly when partner opens 1@C, they have at least 4.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North should bid 2@S. That shows a strong hand, looking for NT if I have a spade stopper. At worst I can always retreat to 3@C without the spade stopper.|

In fact I should have said West's |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at| which is an interesting point about Bergen Hand Evaluation.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Once you find a fit, East, the declarer here should count |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at|. And partner the dummy, West here, should count |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you might ask, why did I say West, who is going to be dummy, should count Bergen's Declarer Points. The reason, it does apply to transfer auctions, is Declarer Points are really the points you count for the hand with the longer trump.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of the time, the hand with the longer trump ends up as declarer. But on this particular auction the hand with long trump happens to be dummy and for the purposes of hand evaluation should still count declarer points because they have the long trump.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So let's count Declarer Points. West has 12 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenstartingpoints,Bergen Starting Points^*N|CP||FP||at|--11 HCP, -1 for dubious @HK, and + 2 for length points.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once they find a fit, you add 2 points for the singleton and 1 point for the side 4+ card diamond suit for 15 pints. It is probably short of needed 33 points for slam. But with the right hand, it shouldn't be a shock if they had good plays for 6.|mb|4S|

up|41|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see, they made 7 and 6 was a great contract. Many people deride hands with "aces and spaces" but they are 100% wrong. A hand with 4 aces is worth closer to 18 points than 16 points. The more aces I have the more I like my hand.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So consider the "aces and spaces" saying to be completely incorrect even though the majority of players believe that. No expert believes that.|
