up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should always make 2 since East has the @SA. North can take 1 spade, 2 hearts, 1 diamond, and 4 clubs for 8 tricks. One principle to remember here when playing a suit is "cash the honors from the short side first." |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case, in hearts, dummy has the short hearts and therefore the correct play is to cash the @HK before taking the finesse. It turns out East has the doubleton queen. That is unlucky since East is known to have 4 clubs and 5 diamonds. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the auction West has many more hearts than East and therefore the heart finesse rates to work most of the time and there was no danger in taking it since North still had a diamond stopper.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1C|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has imperfect choices over 1@C. Personally, I think 1NT is the best bid. Double has too many flaws - no 4 card major and only 2 diamonds. |
