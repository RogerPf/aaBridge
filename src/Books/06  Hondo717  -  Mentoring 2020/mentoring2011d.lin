cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a convention called "Smolen" where they jump to the 3-level in their 4-card suit. They do that to assure the NT opener will always be declarer. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am neutral about Smolen. If you remember it, fine. Otherwise just do natural bidding. Having the NT bidder as declarer sometimes has advantages, but it is highly overrated.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if you have an invitational hand as I do, it is a bit more complicated.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If your 5-card suit is hearts, you bid a 2@D transfer and then bid 2@S over the 2@H response. If your 5-card suit is spades (as mine is), you bid Stayman and bid 2@S if partner responds 2@D. Here I simply bid 2@C Stayman.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner doesn't need much for us to make slam. For example a doubleton heart, the @SQ and the @CK or @CA, which is only 5 or 6 points, and I would make 6@S if we had a spade fit. But let's start with 1@S.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think North's hand is worth a game forcing bid, but with the singleton spade it is close.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once a game force is established, you try to keep the bidding lower to give yourself as much room as possible to explore for your best spot. Opener almost never jumps.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only exception is if opener has a self sufficient suit (for example, say I had AKQ1098 in spades).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A self sufficient suit being defined as at most one loser opposite a singleton. My spade suit is close, as it is 50% opposite a singleton when spades are 3-3, or the @SQ or @SJ are doubleton.|

PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What is the best way to play diamonds for at most 2 losers. The answer is, cash the @DA and then play a low diamond. That works in a lot of situations. For example, any time diamonds are 3-2, or if they are 4-1 if the singleton is an honor (K, Q, of 10), or if East has the @DK and @DQ.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am just pointing out how to play diamonds for at most 2 losers assuming no discard. This kind of problem is known as a suit combination and you need to understand suit combinations to play hands correctly. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are an almost inifinite variety of suit combinations and you can't memorize them. What you have to do is think about the probabilities and figure out the best way to play the suit. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out you can usually decide as opener whether or not to bid game opposite a limit raise without exploring. FYI Marty Bergen is neutral as well.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| I am lucky to make contract. We both had fairly minimum hands, and our fit was not good (singleton @CA opposite @CKx) which is why 4@H was an okay game but not great.|

mb|Pp|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I 100% agree with pass by East, although some might open 1@C. However, the hand does not meet the rule of 20 and it has lots of queens and jacks which are overrated cards.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|MB|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is what is the best tactic in 3rd seat. In 3rd seat you often preempt with a wide range of hands including very weak hands and stronger than normal hands. Clearly in 1st or 2nd seat I have a 1@H opener. But here I am going to bid 3@H.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a non-trivial chance that the opponents have spades (although not on this hand as it turns out). So I want to make it hard for them. Also, we are unlikely to miss game.|

up|11|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am very lucky to make 3@H. I could have easily lost 2 more tricks (another heart and the @DQ) and been down 2. However, the opponents can make 4@C or if guessed to play the spades correctly they can make 3N by East.|

mb|2H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H by East is a tad aggressive since it tends to show a stronger hand. But given the singleton spade, I don't hate it as it describes the distribution nicely.|
