up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I usually don't like cashing aces on defense unless that is the setting trick. Here, at trick three, cashing the @DA was a good idea because it looks like clubs are going to provide discards. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And had East given a suit preference for spades the hand goes down because North can only cash one club and therefore either has the 3rd club trick ruffed or ends up losing a diamond. |

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C probably worked out best. If East bids 1N they play it there. I guess that makes as well, taking 4 clubs 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 diamond. I don't think we can come to 7 tricks before they take 7 or 8.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East bids 2@C not sure what happens. Perhaps they end up in 3@C also. West probably bids 2N over 2@C and East corrects to 3@C. Anyway, East had no perfect bid and although 3@C was not my choice, it certainly was a possible alternative.|

PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have plenty of discussion on the hand. The biggest takeaway is to please, always use Bergen Hand Evaluation. As you can see, HCP are a very flawed way to evaluate your hand. You must take into account fit, other long suits, shortness.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, I would have bid 5@C over 1@S with the void at favorable vulnerability. That makes it harder to get to slam. In fact, East might just decide to double, although I think even if East doubles West bids 5@S.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*nHad they got to 6@S would you have bid 7@C?|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|7@C turns out to be a good sacrifice. We take 7 clubs, 1 heart, and 1 diamond ruff for 9 tricks. For down 4 for -800. However, if they get to 6@S we are bound to get a bad board anyway.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Particularly in Match Points, I doubt 7@C would improve our score much. Which is why I am reluctant to sac against a small slam unless I am playing against a very good pair or I am positive they are making.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North bids 5@C over 1@S, East has a big problem. I probably double with the East hand. But I don't like the doubleton club. Double there is not pure penalty.  However, West should pull the double to 5@S. So double just says East is willing to play 5@C doubled.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand was better and the spades were better. But either 2N or 3N rather than 2@S would have been ok on that hand also.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid by East. It is quantitative. If East wanted to ask for aces he would bid 4@C. Any auction where partner jumps to 4N after I open or rebid NT is quantitative.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't like quantitative unless you define exactly what auctions are quantitative. If you don't then what happens is that one partner thinks its RKCB and the other thinks it is quantitiative. I define only a few auctions as quantitative. See next examples|

PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 2 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds and 2 clubs for 9 tricks and needs three more. If clubs break 3-2 or North holds the @CQ, that's 2 more. And then either the @HJ must come down or you must guess spades.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sk||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the first thing I would do is lead a low club to the Jack. Unfortunately this is going to work out very badly.|
