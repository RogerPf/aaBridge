up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turned out 5@D worked out well for our side. As it turns out we make 6. However, it is very hard to bid 6 with our hands, even absent the preempts.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 5@D was reasonable, but the arguments against bidding it are twofold. First and most important, East has very flat distribution. Flat distribution is always bad when you are declarer. Your hand is worse than it looks. Second, East has 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, there is some merit in for bidding 5@D. Not vul against vul and a 10-card fit are two good reasons. 5-level decisions to bid 5 are very difficult.

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 21 Dummy Points. We need to discount the @DQ. Then, North has 16 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point, and 2 points for the singleton. It is possible we have slam but the North hand has several flaws.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am a passed hand, so at best we have a marginal 33 points. I don't have 6 spades. If I had 6 spades I would have opened 2@S. Therefore, at best we have an 8-card spade fit. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And when there is a preempt, a 4-1 break is much more likely, close to 50% rather than the 32% it normally is. So I think pass by North over 4@S is reasonable. And some players would bid 3@C rather than doubling and we might end up there instead.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, I am betting that +1100 will be a very good board for N/S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N is a better bid by West. East can't pass. BTW, 2@H is a reverse. By bidding 2@H West's distribution in the red suits should be at least 5 diamonds and probably only 4 hearts.|

at|^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because when you reverse, you promise 5+ cards in your first suit. If you are 4-4 in your 2 suits, then you are balanced and would either open in NT or rebid in NT. You never reverse with 4-4.|
