PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|
pc|HA|sk|e|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East does not have a clear lead. A singleton is often a good lead, but not so much when it is the opponents suit. Further, I don't generally like to lead unprotected aces. However, in this case, it is probably safe.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sk||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a very difficult contract. The problem is, you would like to draw trump and then run diamonds. That would give you 10 tricks. However, you have to worry about losing clubs. So you need to keep trump in dummy. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would probably lead a low spade after ruffing the heart and hope East has the @SK. If that is the case, then regardless of what EW do, if spades are 3-2 you will make the hand, taking 4 spades and 6 diamonds (losing 1 Heart, 1 Spade, and 1 club). |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sk||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on this hand, with the bad break particularly with West having the @SK that line does not work either. 8 card fits are often difficult to play in because 4-1 breaks occur 1/3 of the time. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although I do agree with North's 4@S bid with a weak trump suit, if it turns out we have an 8-card fit it is not surprising if we go down.|

mb|P|mb|2C|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good 2@H bid. You should strain to compete but partner should know you can't be strong and give you lots of leeway. So I very much like the 2@H bid. In fact, if East had better distribution, a singleton or void, 3@H would not be out of the question.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss what experts play after interference over 2@C. Regardless of whether or not you play this, you need to have firm agreements.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, double by responder shows a bust and pass shows a positive hand. I am not sure why they play that, since it is somewhat counter intuitive.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So that's fine and equivalent if you want to play pass shows a bust and double shows a positive hand. However, you ^*BMUST^*N have an agreement.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now on this particular hand I can bid 2@S which is what I would have bid over 2@C in any case. That shows a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors.|mb|2S|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a flat hand I am not sure 3@H is wise here. As I said, partner needs to give the overcaller a lot of leeway. If we decided to double, they lose 7 tricks and are down 3. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


mb|3N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We should obviously be in slam. Without interference we have a better chance of getting there. It would go 2@C-P-2@S-P-2N (or 3@C). I would bid 3@S and North, knowing we have an 8-card spade fit might bid RKCB and get us to at least 6 if not 7.|

PG| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*NDo you still bid 2@S if no interfearance?|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Although almost all of the time you bid 2@D, waiting, over 2@C.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Or you can occasionally bid a suit when you have a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think North might pass 3@H. That is 100% forcing. Once I make a positive response (and even if I don't) our side is committed to either bidding game or doubling the opponents.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North passes, I bid 3@S to show my extra spade and then North can bid slam. I think rather than unilaterally decide on 3NT, pass is better by North.

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would pass also with the North hand. But using Bergen "adjusted HCP" you could say that North has 11 HCP + 1 for the quality suit for a total of 12 meaning the hand does meet the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Between regular and reverse, Bergen has a slight preference for the first one, although even he says it is basically irrelevant which you play.|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some would open 3@C particularly at this vul and that would be okay. However, there are 2 arguments against that. The first is, particularly in 1st seat and 2nd seat, I think it is normally better to only open 3@C with a 6-card suit if you also have a singleton or void.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And the second argument is that you should be less inclined to make marginal preempts in 2nd seat because, since one opponent already passed, it is now much more likely that you will preempt partner.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, on this hand West is the one with the strong hand. But suppose we switched West and North. Then as you can see I would have preempted partner. So my best bid is pass.|mb|P|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


mb|1N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 1NT is still best, but you could make a case for treating this as an 18 point hand with the 5-card quailty spade suit, and opening 1@S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have played as West did hoping that North started with 3 hearts which is more likely given the doubleton club. So the point of this hand is to make lead directing bids when you can.|
