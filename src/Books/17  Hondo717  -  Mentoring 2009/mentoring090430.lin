at|^B@2^Y@3With this BBO movie, which is based on Howard's mentoring sessions, I will be adopting a somewhat different format. It is a compromise, based on time constraints and on viewer responses to my earlier request. 

Unlike the live sessions, all deals will be presented in an open format unless there is an exceptional teaching value to a deal--in which case, you will view that deal in a closed format. In addition, to enhance its teaching value, there is a quiz to choose the bidding and to plan the play of the hand.

It is my sincere hope that you continue to learn from Howard's teaching and you enjoy the new format. I like to hear your input. My email address is kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.

To get more from the movie please read the "Introduction and Help Notes" which is next. You can, click  ^$119  box located second from left in BBO toolbar to return to the TABLE OF CONTENTS.|

^-|cp|8|FP||at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely done marge. Turns out slam is a very good contract, but not sure it can be bid. First let us see if the points add up. Once you find a club fit, lets count marge's Declarer Points first. She has 15 HCP, 2 length points, for 17 starting points. Then she can add 2 for the singleton, 1 for the 4 card heart suit, and one for the sixth club as declarer addons. That gives her 21. lisa has 12 HCP + 1 quality club suit + 1 for doubleton heart is 14. So the points do add up.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the bidding makes it difficult. I am not sure what lisa should do over 2@D. Negative double has some merit, but she lacks hearts. Another possibility is 3@D as a club raise. But lets assume the negative double works. I think marge has to bid 3 clubs, 4 clubs takes up too much room. Then, think 4@C by lisa is a bit weak.

marge if lisa gets aggressive and bids 5C, would you bid six?|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is an interesting call klaus. But marge may think that lisa is looking for 3N and showing a heart stopper. So, I am not sure you can get there, but I guess the best way is if lisa bids 5@C instead of 4 clubs
and marge bids slam.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding got a bit out of hand there. lets see if we can figure out why. The first two bids are fine. marge, did you realize that 3 clubs is a reverse?|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|
MarDef: Yes, but thought I had the points.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss first why 3@C is a reverse, and then the plusses and minuses of marge's hand. A reverse is defined as |cp|8|at|voluntarily|cp||at| bidding past your suit at the 2 level. Since 2@H was available to marge as a bid, any bid over 2@H is a reverse.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|marge has a good hand. Using Bergen starting points, 12 HCP, 2 length points, plus quality suit. So total is 15. On the other hand, if you use the Bergen methods, then you need 17 to reverse. However if you use losing trick count, marge only has a 5 loser hand and that is enough to reverse. So depending on how you evaluate your hand, you might or might not feel you have a reverse.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think the thing that tips the balance in my opinion about not having a reverse is the void in lisa's suit. Had lisa bid any suit but diamonds, the void is very good. But the void is a negative once lisa bids diamonds. I think I would have chosen 2@H, although as I said, a case could be made for 3@C.  lisa, has enough for game. However, in general, better to play in 3N than 5 of a minor. There is an interesting bid lisa can make in this auction, That asks marge for a spade stopper. Because if lisa had a spade stopper, she could bid 3N herself.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if you are possibly looking for 3N, and there is only 1 suit left, if someone bids that suit, it is asking, because to tell they can bid 3N. 5@C was not a bad call. The problem was that marge's reverse didn't work out. It turns out the best contract is 4@H. But that goes down as well. we take 2 spades a heart, and a minor suit trick.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another interesting bidding problem. The auction is  always down 2. Klau's 4@S bid is aggressive  given the vulnerability in particular. On the minus side, his spades are weak. On the plus side, however, he is short in both our suits. So, it is a bit of a shot, but it could work really well.  Because of the vulnerability and my spade void, I thought 5@C was clearly right. But it turns out it is down 1. As to whether lisa should bid 5@S. The one reason to bid it is she has lots of spades, so it is likely one of us is void. But, there are 3 reasons not to bid it.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
- the first is the general rule "the 5 level belongs to the opponents." What that means is, all things being equal (which they never are, lol), you should not bid 5 over 5.
- the second reason is the vulnerability, and
- the third reason, as marge correctly points out, is she has 2 tricks. So if klaus has one trick we are down.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is hard, because she has 5 spades, it is even possible that 5@S will make. But if 5@S is making, we are going down. And there is some possibility that neither 5@S nor 5@C are making. So given the one plus against the 3 minuses, I think pass by lisa is probably best. But these hands are never obvious. you have to weigh all the factors and use your best judgement.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
MarDef: Howard, would you have doubled?|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a concept known as a "forcing pass." The basic concept is that, if you know the opponents are sacrificing, and partner passes, she is leaving the decision up to you. I must either double or bid 6@C. So a pass by marge there, says she has a spade control. Therefore double by you was absolutely the best bid  as, with my spade void, I might decide to bid 6@C.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An important signaling technique by klaus at trick three. In general, to encourage, you play your 2nd highest in a suit if you can afford it. In this hand, that would mean on the Q of spades, klaus would play the 10. However, klaus can't really afford the 10, so he plays the highest one he can afford which is the 8. In general, when encouraging, throw the highest card you can.  I notice people often play their 2nd lowest when they have 4. So, if they have, say A864 and want to encourage, they play the six. It is  much better to play the eight. Hit partner over the head if you can, lol.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And of course the other issue is marge should make the hand. Since she has a singleton heart, no reason for her to take the heart finesse.  She can take the ace of hearts, and ruff a spade in dummy. She has all the rest of the tricks, 7 diamonds, 1 ruff, ace of hearts.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding.  2@D is fine by marge, although as you know, I would open 3@D.  I tend to preempt based more on length than strength, so with 7 diamond I bid 3@d. But many people do not like to do that with a bad suit, so 2@D is fine if that suits your style. As to whether lisa should raise spades. Absolutely, the only question is whether she should bid 3 or 4. She has 11 HCP, 1 quality suit, plus a doubleton for 13 Bergen dummy points. additionally, she has no wasted diamond points. So she should bid at least 3, and I think 4 is preferable although 4 is a tad aggressive.|

analisals: The vul scared me.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an interesting point lisa. The vul should actually encourage you. It is unlikely you will be doubled, and vul games are worth a lot of imps.  Partner can't overcall 2@S over 2D with 5 points. Here, partner is showing values, an opening hand, perhaps a tad less with some distribution. But you should assume an opening hand. I think you make 5@S.|

sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|lisa plays specific. Let me explain lisa's bid. There are two alternatives to responding to 5N king ask. One is to specify the number of kings 6C =0 , 6D = 1, 6H = 2, 6S = 3. Here, if lisa played that she would have bid 6@C. The other alternative is known as "specific kings"  that means, if lisa has a king, she bids the lowest suit in which she has a king, six of the trump suit otherwise. So, if she had the K of clubs she would bid 6 clubs for example. Playing specific kings, since lisa had no kings she bids 6@H, the trump suit.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, there is also an issue of what lisa should bid if she has the K of spades. Since that is past 6@H  if playing specific kings, I play that she must bid 6@S, and I must be prepared for that. But you have to have an agreement with your partner. Next, let's discuss the auction. lisa doesn't really have an opening hand, but glad she did, as it made it much more interesting, :). By Bergen, she has 10 HCP, 1 length point - 1 for dubious singleton = 10 which is not even close to an opener. By rule of 20 she 10 HCP + 9 in red suits = 19.|

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first thing I want to discuss is when 4N is not Blackwood, when 4N is what is known as |cp|8|at|QUANTITATIVE|cp||at|. Marty Bergen likes 4N as quantitative, but I do not, as I think it can easily be confused with Blackwood. Below are only 5 auctions where I feel a 4N bid is quantitative, and 4@C is Gerber.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


FP|2|cp|8|AT|^D

1) if partner opens 1N, 4N is quantitative, 4@C is Gerber|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT|
2) same if partner opens 2N|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT|
3) same if the auction goes 2C-2D-2N (which essentially is a 2N opener)|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


AT|
4) 1x-1y-1N, then 4C is Gerber (even if x was clubs) and 4N is quantitative, and|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT|
5) 1x-1y-2N|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


CP||AT|

Those are the only cases where I recommend Gerber and Quantitative 4N are used. In all other cases 4@C is natural and 4N is Blackwood.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^C@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|Let me address when should responder bid 4NT. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT|   If partner opens 1NT (15-17) and you have 17 points 4NT might be a good bid. When partner has 16 or 17, you can be in slam. for example in the following auction, |HT|V|AT|{|ia|,1np4np?|at|}|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


HT|u|AT|^N@2^z@3The 1N bidder should bid 6N with 16 or 17 points. |

PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

With Roman Key card Blackwood, there are 5 Key cards, the 4 aces plus the K of the agreed trump suit. If partner bids 4N, responses are as follows;|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT|
- 5@C = 1 or 4 Key cards, |
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


AT|
- 5@D = 0 or 3 Key cards, |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|
- 5@H = 2 or 5 Key cards without the Q of trumps, and |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


AT|
- 5@S = 2 or 5 Key cards with the Q of trumps|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

That is known as 1430, some people reverse 5@C and 5@D. If you play 5@C = 0 or 3, and 5@D = 1 or 4, that is known as 0314, but most people play 1430. |
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


AT|

One thing to remember is, once you bid 4N, you are responsible for placing the final contract. Your partner just answers your questions, and should not override your decision. Therefore, you need to know what you are going to bid over any response, before you bid Blackwood. Basically, you should bid slam if you are not missing any Key cards, or if you are missing one Key card and not the Q of trumps. Your decision making as the Blackwood bidder is very straight forward.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


cp|8|FP|2|AT|

Bid slam if missing no Key cards, or 1 Key card and not the Q of trumps. |CP||FP||AT|And,|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


cp|8|FP|2|AT|
You should not bid Blackwood unless you are sure you have all suits controlled, usually by using control bids. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|

Let us look at a couple of examples. The same drill. evaluate the hand and choose your bid before I give you the correct answer.|

In this case, you have all the suits controlled, and plenty of points for slam, just bid 4N. Let us contrast this with the next example.

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once the Blackwood bidder receives a response to 4N, he may then bid 5N as a king ask. There are two variations to the K response. The variation I have a preference for is to respond with the number of kings (obviously not counting the K of trumps).|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|

- 6@C = 0 kings, 
- 6@D = 1 king, 
- 6@H = 2 kings, 
- 6@S = 3 kings. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

The other variation is "specific kings". If you play that, then you respond with the cheapest suit in which you have an outside K; if you do not have an outside K, you bid six in the agreed upon trump suit. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

The main complication playing specific kings is if your specific king is in a suit higher than the agreed upon trump suit. I play that you should respond with your specific king even in that case (partner needs to be prepared for that response), but some people play you can only respond with a specific king if it is in a suit lower than your agreed upon trump suit.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|

Also, most people play that if the Blackwood bidder bids 5N as a king ask, that guarantees your side has all 5 key cards. That allows the responder, on rare occasions, to bid seven if he has a hand with an undisclosed feature that will most likely allow seven to make (such as a long solid side suit, which will generate many tricks).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|kiri found the only defense to beat the hand, nice going. Now, a couple of comments on the bidding. lisa can certainly bid 1@S with her hand, but she should strongly consider 3@D as an alternative. Although technically, that denies a 4 card major, in this case, it is probably a better tactical bid.  kiri's double tends to show spades, so 3@D is probably a more effective bid. even if we have a spade fit, a 4-1 break is very possible. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|True, 3@D is weak over the double. Any bid other than redouble (or Jordan 2N if you play it) shows less than 10 points. As to klaus' bids. He is 5/5 which is good, so I like 2@H. I am not sure I like 4@C though, the K of diamonds should be discounted, which means klaus only has 4 working HCP, all queens and jacks. However, if he figures out the hearts, he can make 4 clubs or 4 hearts. So it worked out ok.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is a little known treatment by experts with interference over 2@C.

- double is the weakest bid you can make. Shows no controls;
- pass promises at least one king; and
- suits are natural. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have to be careful here. it is likely pam has a singleton heart. So I have to retain the Q of spades to over ruff pam in case Ira has the ace of spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not much to this hand. a few small comments.  ally has a 2@C followed by 2N bid, assuming no interference. My response to 2@C is still 2@D. In order to respond in a new suit, I must have 5+ cards, with two of the top three honors.  I have 5 spades, but not two of the top 3, so had Ira passed my proper response is 2@D.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I know quite a bit about the distribution from the bidding. I know ally has 2 hearts, because Ira must have 5 for his opening bid. Ira likely has only 1 or 2 spades, since he might very well bid 2@S were he 3-5-4-1.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general the 9 was the correct signal by ally. However, if she feels I have Qx in diamonds, then Ira has J10, so she should signal with the 7.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The interesting thing about this hand was that I could pretty much figure out what Ira had after the first few tricks.  I already knew he had 5 hearts and 4 clubs from the bidding. He might have more than 4 clubs, but at least 4. I also know he probably does not have 3 spades, as I said, because he might very well bid 2@S over 2@H. So, once it turns out he has 2 diamonds, I pretty much know his hand was 2-5-2-4 to start with. The point here is not so much these specific deductions, as that you can figure out quite a lot from the bidding, the cards on the first few tricks, and partner's carding.|

dee_dee_20: What if 3/3 in minors?  Would he bid up the line?|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|dee, on this hand, Ira is promising 4 clubs. there is no reason to bid a 3 card club suit over 1@S. He would probably bid 1N if 3-3 in the minors. It is true that people misbid sometimes, so your conclusions are sometimes incorrect, but more often than not they are correct.|
