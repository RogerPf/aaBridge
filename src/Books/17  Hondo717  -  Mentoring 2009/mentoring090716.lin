at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

I also have 1 for quality suit and 3 for the singleton (because I have 4+ trump). The my Dummy Points is around 12. I also know we have a 10 card fit at least, because pard is showing 5+ clubs and 4+ diamonds. With 17 + 12 = 29, so we must have a shot at game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me help. Your contract is 5C. The lead is most likely from a length with Jack or Queen as an honor. You have at least one trump loser, it could be two if the trumps are 3-0, one heart, one possible spade  and no diamond loser.  After, winning the lead with Ace, you cash the K of diamonds and pitch the heart from dummy. Then, you will lose one spade and one club at most assuming you then draw one round of trumps on third trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no possibility of a trump finesse anyway, if trumps are 2-1 you have one trump loser no matter what. You are missing the KQ and J, so you have to lose one trump trick at least. So pitch the heart, play the ace of clubs, and take the spade finesse. Since it works, you can yell at me for not bidding slam, lol.|

First, why I should bid 5 clubs, based on Bergen Points and the second thing was to plan the hand. there were 3 potential losers, 1 heart, 1 club (assuming 2-1 break), and 1 spade. The heart loser can go on the diamond, so the spade loser was a 50-50 finesse. Even if it lost, 5 would make.|

Based on bidding most of the points should be with the East. For now you will lose 2 spades, 2 Diamonds, 1 heart and unlikely possiblity of a club losers. Your basic plan is to hope to draw trumps and set up hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My double was DONT showing a single suit forces 2C by norma, and I pass with clubs or bid my suit. As to what I need to double, many people play you need a six card suit.  I tend to be a bit more relaxed. You either need a six card suit, or a good five card suit. And AKQxx certainly qualifies as a "good 5 card suit."  norma is supposed to bid 2C, unless she has a really good suit of her own, good six card suit, 3 honors or 7+. On this hand, 2C was correct.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, there really wasn't much to the hand. You have 2 spade losers and 2 diamond losers for sure. You have to hope the heart finesse works (unlikely given the auction), or clubs are 3-3 in order to make the hand. Unfortunately, neither occurred.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unfortunate we have a better heart fit, but the purpose of DONT is to find a reasonable partial, not the optimal one. 2H probably does make, but I am not sure we would get there even if I passed, since norma's heart suit is not really good enough for her to make a DONT double.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the plusses and minusses of DONT vs CAPP. First of all, we are talking about competing over the strong NT, which is what most everyone plays. The weak NT is a different discussion. Over the strong NT, the probability that you have game if the opp opens 1N is fairly low. It does happen, but not often. Usually, you will get better results more often if you have a system that lets you compete for a partscore.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|DONT is the best system I know for competing for a part score. With any single suited or 2 suited hand, you can compete at the 2 level. I personally often bid DONT with 4-4 even, and with a good 5 card suit which I treat as a single suited hand. Other people are more conservative (many say more sane, lol), but I have done well competing.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My basic guidelines are that I can bid DONT with as few as 8 or 9 points with 5/5, if my points are located in my suits. With 5/4 I like to have just below an opening hand at least. And with 4/4 an opening hand. If my high cards are outside my suit, I am a bit more conservative.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because lisa is 5/5 and has 10 HCP (although the Q of clubs is suspect), she should want to compete. Granted I would like it better if the A of spades were in a red suit, but I think she just barely has enough to compete. 5/5 hands are very powerful, more than their HCP indicate. Now why do people prefer CAPP. One reason is they would like to be able to double 1N. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In CAPP, double over 1N shows a desire to defend against 1N. But in real life, I find you rarely get a hand good enough to want to defend, so I think by the frequency of occurrence argument, having a penalty double available is not that important.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other argument is that the suits are more precise in CAPP, but I dont really buy that. 2D in CAPP shows hearts and spades, but 2H in DONT shows the same thing and 2 of a major shows the major and a minor, and you know which major. Granted, with a 2C bid in DONT, you don't know pard's other suit, but you often can work it out and with 2D, you know pard has a major. This is really no different than CAPP, where with 2 of a major, you know pard's major but don't know which minor he has.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With CAPP, if you have a major and a minor, you are forced to the 3 level if you want to play in your minor. So you have to have a better hand to bid 2 of a major in CAPP, Basically, the bottom line for me  is, DONT lets me compete effectively at the 2 level with some fairly weak hands. But, if you like CAPP better, you should play whatever suits your style. One final comment on DONT.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a revised version which I play and like slightly better. The reason I like it better is that with a single suited major, you get to preempt the opponent, and those occur more often than 2 suited hands. In the revised version of DONT, 2H shows a single suited heart hand. The question then becomes, how do you show hearts and spades, since 2H no longer shows hearts and spades.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In revised DONT, the double is used when you have hearts and spades. As most of you know, over the double, pard is supposed to bid 2C, and, if over 2C you bid 2H, pard knows you have hearts and spades, since if you just had hearts, you would have bid 2H to start with.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
EddyHaskel: So 2h is long hearts, 2s is long spades, and x is either a long single minor or hearts and spades.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes eddy.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to why I bid 2H over 2D. That is the way DONT works. If I don't have diamonds, I do not know if lisa has hearts or spades. Therefore, I bid 2H, which allows lisa to pass with hearts and bid spades with spades. That way we get to the right spot. There is an excellent fireside chat movie on DONT, downloadable from my site ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets discuss the meaning of that bid. Do you play 4th suit forcing john?|

AT|
JohnnyHiLo: Yes.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case, john's bid is not forcing. It tends to show an invitational, not game force hand, with very good hearts.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's count john's Bergen Points and see if he has an invitational hand. He has 10 hcp. He deducts 1 point for dubious doubleton of Jx, so down to 9. He has 2 length points and  also has a quality suit. So his total is 10 -1 + 2 + 1 or 12 points which is an invitational hand, but just barely, almost a game force. The optimist in me would call it a game force. But john is really right.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, clubs look nice, so how about finesse one round of trumps, play the ace, and then play clubs. That way, because you still have a trump in dummy, you won't lose a diamond even if trumps don't break. You need not ruff diamonds, you will pitch them on clubs. just play another trump, and start on clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So we saw how a good plan helps you play the hand. It is hard to come up with a good plan, which is why I am helping everyone each week to prasctice making a plan. But, as you can see, it is an important skill to learn. The alternative would be for john to ruff 2 diamonds, but that would be harder as he does not have enough entries to his hand. Now, a couple of other things. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed that if you play 4th suit forcing, a jump rebid by responder (3h by john on this hand) is not an absolute game force, although more often than not you  end up in game. But if norma had a bare opener and heart shortness, she is allowed to pass 3H. If john had the same hand but another hcp or two, he would have to bid 2D, 4sf and then rebid hearts.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT|^B@2
peppygal: I hesitated bidding a 3 card suit,  but did not like any other bid.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, let us discuss the 1S bid by norma. Why did you not like to bid 2C with your hand norma? You have a good six card suit and 1S is really a big lie, as you only have 3. Further, 1S can be passed as well, but worse than that, suppose partner bids 4 spades, or even six spades. You could make a case that you have a 3C bid, but you need to rebid your clubs. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is good that you recognized you have a good hand, so if you wanted to stretch a bit, I would not quarrel with 3C. I guess some of you think that a new suit by opener is forcing, such as norma's 1S bid. But that is not true. only a new suit by responder is forcing. if opener wants to force, they must reverse or jump shift. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|^B@2
analisals: Howard- if 2 diamonds already forces to game why use 4sf?|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose we change john's Q of diamonds to the King, lisa. Now john has a game forcing hand. So, he bids 2D to establish the game force. All that says is "pard, we are now forced to game and my next bid will clarify what I have." Then john would rebid his hearts, to show a game forcing hand with good hearts.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |

amcs: Is west's 1!S bid a reverse?|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, it is not a reverse. A reverse is when you |cp|8|at|voluntarily|cp||at| bid past your suit at the 2 level, such as 1C-1S-2H. In that case opener bid past 2C, so is showing extra values. But 1S is lower than 2C, so it simply shows spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I clearly could just bid 3N, but with a six card suit, let's see if slam makes any sense. let's count Bergen Points. I have 11 HCP. Subtract one for dubious heart doubleton, add 2 length points and 1 for quality suit. So 11 - 1 + 2 + 1 = 13. If pard had diamonds, could also add one for 2 doubletons and if pard had 17 (might have more with diamonds, but let's just say 17), 17 + 14 = 31. No, not quite enough. So, 3NT is the correct bid.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good. but let me expand on it. First, evaluate the opening lead and consider whether Rule 7 or 11 are helpfull. Next, you count your winners and determine how many more tricks you need to make your contract. Then you have to decide how safely make those extra trick.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead is from a long suit probably headed by either King or Jack. Considering your Hearts holding you can ignore the Rules for now. You have six diamonds and 2 hearts. Spade should easily give you #9 trick simply by establishing the suit ASAP. Good luck.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done in general. As I mentioned earlier, my only suggestion is that you should try spades before playing all the diamonds from your hand. You are entitled to at least 2 spade tricks. Against expert defenders, the first spade would be ducked, and then you are cut off from your hand. The general principle here is that part of planning is to manage your entries. Regardless, generally you had a good plan and played it nicely :).|
