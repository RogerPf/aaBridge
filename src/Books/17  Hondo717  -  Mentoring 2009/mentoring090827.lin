at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not much to this hand.  3 clear losers. The only issue is what we already discussed. A jump to game over 2C-2D-2H/2S is weaker, showing no aces or kings, than a raise to the 3 level. Let me also discuss how to show a negative hand over 2C. Some people play that I should bid 2H, which shows no aces or kings and that is a reasonable way to play.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Other people play that I should bid 2D, and then bid my cheapest minor over a suit bid to show a hand with no controls. For example, on this hand, if the auction had gone 2C-2D-2H, a 3C bid by me is not clubs, but is known as "2nd negative", meaning because I bid my cheapest minor, I am showing a hand with no aces or kings. Similarly, if the auction had gone 2C-2D-3C, a 3D bid by me (cheapest minor) would also show a hand with no aces or kings. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, there are two alternatives to showing the 2C bidder you have no aces or kings. Either 2H initially, showing a bust, or cheapest minor as your 2nd bid, showing a bust.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|
analisals: Which one do you use?|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Both. Ava prefers 2nd negative, but most of my other pards prefer 2H as bust. I am kind of neutral, both have plusses and minuses. 2H is easier, so that is what I probably recommend for you.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss  jana's double. Some would play that is takeout showing 4 spades. My rule is that a double is takeout only when partner has only passed (true in this auction) and when there are 2 unbid suits (not true in this auction).  jana could just bid 2S, she cant have 5S, since she opened 1C. So a 2S bid by jana shows 5+ clubs and 4 spades. Double is probably showing some sort of strong hand with diamond cards.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done darlene. I discussed the bidding.Now to the play. At trick three there was no danger if you started diamonds first, to establish a diamond trick. You do have 9 tricks for sure, 5 hearts, 2 spades, and 2 minor suit aces. You have a sure play for 10  with no danger, so might as well play it. If you led a low diamond at trick 3, if jana wins, she can only cash 1 club. And if lisa wins, she has no clubs to lead back. So if you did that, you might make 5 or at least 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my declarer points using Bergen hand evaluation to decide whether to bid 3 or 4. I have 11 HCP + 2 length points + 1 for quality spade suit - 1 dubious doubleton which is 13 starting points. Next, I add 2 for singleton, and 1 for outside 4 card suit as declarer addons, so have 16 total points. Therefore, even if lisa only has 10, I have enough to bid game. I could even make a case that I should bid 4H (which is a splinter), but since I lack controls outside the spade suit, I will not bid that.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, I had a couple of questions about the best bid for jana over 1S. Over 1S, some people suggested jana should bid 2C as 4th suit forcing to game. There are certainly hands where that would be a good bid, even when jana has spades. For example if she was interested in slam. However, since darlene did not jump shift to 2S, slam is very unlikely, so I think 4S is best, showing a min opener with 4 spades. On the other hand, if you felt that jana's hand was good enough for a slam try, then 2C followed by a spade raise would show a slam try.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|lisa came up with a reasonable plan, even though it didn't work. If hearts break 3-3, she can count on 4 hearts and 5 spade tricks. And if jana has the ace of clubs, the king of clubs is her 10th trick. Unfortunately hearts were not 3-3 nor was the ace of clubs onside. As to whether or not to bid game. Let's count lisa's points. She has 15 HCP + 1 length point + 1 quality suit. However, she must subtract 2 for the dubious doubletons and 1 for quacks are more than aces/ten which only gives her 14. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since darlene is showing 6-9, it is very unlikely that she has game, so she should probably pass 2S.  lisa has one of those hands that look better than they really are. As Marty Bergen points out, you really need to devalue hands with queens and jacks, as this hand shows.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming you don't play 3C 2nd negative, then 3C over 2S. Then I bid 3H, you bid 3N, I bid 4C, that would get us to 6C, since you know I must be short in diamonds. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So a possible auction is 2C-2D-2S-3C-3H-3N-4C-6C

I must be 5-4-1-3 at worst and I pretty much have to have the ace of spades. I think that is a reasonable auction but hard hand to bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first off, pam has a clear opener. How come you did not open pam? It turns out we might end up in hearts, and with the 5-0 split we are in big trouble, but still should be opened.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|
onoway: Because  I had not a single honor in the only suit I had. So didn't want to open 1@h.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Doesn't matter pam, you still need to open. You can open 1H with 65432 if your hand otherwise meets the rule of 20. Getting in the auction early is a big advantage.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, here, if I had better hearts, we might miss our heart game. With people preempting, it is important to open whenever you can. You need to become more of a bridge optimist.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, it turns out we did ok, since we cannot make game.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, wbaker has an interesting preempt. Many would not open 3S, but I thought it was a very good bid. His distribution is very powerful. Give Ira as little as Axx of spades and the K of diamonds, and 4S makes on 12 HCP  between the 2 hands. Nice bid all around.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, declarer did the best he could. Double dummy, I can lead a trump and beat him one more, but my intention was to set up diamond tricks for us. So I thought a diamond was a better lead. It is unlikely that it will cost us a trick, given declarer has preempted, so (presumably) most of his strength is concentrated in spades. A trump lead will often give up a trick when declarer has preempted, so it should be avoided, except possibly when dummy has raised.|
