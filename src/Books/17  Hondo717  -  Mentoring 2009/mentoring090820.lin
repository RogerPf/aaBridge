at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

PG| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well ginny, I think you have an opening hand by rule of 20. You have 13 Starting Points using Bergen hand evaluation you have 13 Starting Points which is enough to open. 10 HCP + 2 length points + 1 quality suit. It turns out I beleive you can make 5 clubs. In general, it is better to get in the auction early than not.|

robzim: Guess if she'd opened 1!H I could go to 3NT with 2 stoppers in spades -- assuming you had the KQ (which I know I can't assume with you vulnerable or not).|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can't assume that, but you can figure it is probable and, although 3N happens to go down, if the club finesse works it makes.  As you can see, my 3S bid messed up the opponents, which is why I advocate aggressive preempting. However, I have to admit, if you asked 10 experts, 9 would not bid 3S. most would bid 2S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, this is a case where I have to reevaluate my hand. I only have 7 HCP. But according to Bergen hand evaluation I have 7 HCP, 2 length points + 1 quality suit, for 10 Starting Points. Once partner raises, I add 2 for singleton spade (which is probably not enough add on), 1 for sixth trump, and 1 for 4 clubs. So I have a total of 14 Declarer Points, more than enough for game. In fact, given pard opened 1C and raised hearts, it is more likely we will make six than go down in 4, although exploring for six is not a good idea.|

UP|44|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very interesting hand, and well bid by everyone.  roberta has an interesting problem over 1C. Unfortunately, she has no way to show a 2 suiter with spades and diamonds. I  have often thought that Michaels over a minor should show spades and either hearts or the unbid minor, but no one plays that.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the question is, should she bid at all, and if so, which suit. Certainly her diamonds are longer and stronger than her spades. So 1D, or better yet, 2D is fine. You could also make a case for 1S, as a tactic in case pard has spades and can compete. But I think diamonds is a fine bid.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Everything normal up to 4H, although some thought I was being agressive and, if they lead diamonds, 4H is down 1. But, as you can see, we did make 4H. Of course we were in 5, lol. It turns out that they are down 1 in 4 spades. However, I have no defense against 4S, so 5H is right if we make 5H, or  if they make 4S, or both. So, 5H is clear, as more often than not it will work out better than defending 4S.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just not on this hand. And -50 will not be a horrible result, whereas 4S making is a bad result, as is 5H if we make it. So basically, although it turns out non-optimal here, the odds are 5H will work out much better much more often.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
robzim: Wbaker's 2@H bid -- I thought that would show 4 if you bid 1@H over 1@C.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me answer your question in 2 parts. It is often ok to raise partner in this auction with 3 card support. If you have 3 to an honor, and shortness somewhere, raising 1H to 2H is fine. BTW, there is a convention known as support double and redouble which would be helpful here (although in general I am not a big fan of this convention). In that convention, a redouble by wbaker would show 3 card support, and a raise to 2H would show 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had East bid 1S instead of double, then, if you play support doubles, a double by wbaker would show 3 card heart support. The convention works ok when there is an intervening bid, but often it is right to raise with 3 card support with no intervening bid.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, I don't think 2H is the best bid. I think, as a few kibs opined, 1N is much better, because although wbaker has good 3 card support, he also has a nice balanced hand with cards in all suits.|

mb|2N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me review Ogust responses. By bidding 2N, wbaker is asking roberta about the quality of her suit, and her HCP. A good suit is considered one with 2 of the top 3 honors and  a max high card point hand considered one with 8 HCP or more. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let us discuss what wbaker should bid. Typically, unless you have a good reason not to play in pard's suit, you should strain to play in the weak 2 bidder's suit. Also, there is a case to be made that wbaker should just pass 2H, she is a little weak for Ogust, particularly if her pard's open weak 2s like I do. Here, I think pass is best bid. On the other hand over 3S I would bid 4H with the East hand. It usually better to play in a suit over a weak 2.|

UP|41|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okak, we need to talk about the defense there. At trick 3, roberta can just about count out hearts after the opening lead. She has 5, dummy has 4, so either ginny started with KJ5 or KJ tight. In either case, cashing the Ace is right, because if ginny started with KJ5 then wbaker cannot return a heart. Had she played the Ace they take 4 hearts, 2S, and a diamond, and beat the hand.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, counting out the hand is very important. And often after trick 1, you can count out the suit you led. It is important to count out the hand. Not hard to do when you make it a habit and a good habit to develop. There is a tutorial on my web site on counting out the hand, for those interested. ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets talk about the bidding first. Althought double is ok, 1NT is another bid aggie should consider. It shows 11-14 balanced with some club points and I think it is a bit more descriptive. However, they did end up in the reasonable 3N contract anyway. Also, isabable should consider a takeout double over 1C, although pass is reasonable.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us count winners for aggie. She can count 1D, and 3 hearts, once hearts are played plus 3 spades and 2 clubs and there are only 4 losers.  2 diamonds, 1 heart, and 1 club. So, she should be able to take 9 tricks. The problem was she lost an extra diamond tricks. She should not duck the K of diamonds hoping that  "hope" has the AQ.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, regarding hope's defense. It is usually not a good idea to keep switching suit. I would have led a club to start myself. 4th, from longest and strongest works out best in the long run. I would have continued playing clubs. If she does that, she will set up 4 club tricks for herself.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the 2 points of this hand are:|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |

a) declarer should count her winners and losers and play accordingly;|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |

b) lead 4th from longest and strongest in NT which is almost always right. The only exception is you should lead pard's suit.|

To that you can add 3 points for the singleton which gives you  12 Dummy Points. It is close But, I would say you are just shy. I don't hate 3S. It is just a smidge aggressive.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we already discussed isabable's bid. She did well to realize, despite her 8 HCP, she almost has a splinter. It was good hand evaluation by her :). As to the play, let me discuss how I would have approached the hand. I would have played diamonds right away, to see where the ace was. If the ace is onside, I have 1 diamond loser, 1 heart loser, and maybe 1 spade loser.|

delcod1(aggie): Before calling trump ??|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, you need to ruff 2 spades in dummy at least.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If hearts are not 2-2, then we might pull a 3rd trump before you get a chance to ruff 2 spades. So, your best play is to try diamonds, then draw 2 rounds of trump and cross ruff. Fortunately, since hearts broke 2-2 it didnt matter, so you ended up doing that anyway. But this is a hand where delaying drawing trumps is a good idea. The general rule is to draw trumps unless there is a good reason not to.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, ruffing 2 spades is a good reason not to. I would say about 50% of the time, you should not draw trumps first, but you do have to plan the hand before deciding.|

PG| ***** 167 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, not sure about that aggie. Let us see what aggie can do over 3C. Once I bid 3C, aggie knows I have diamonds--likely 5 of them. The only problem with her hand is the Qs and Js outside the diamond suit. For example, if the QJ of hearts were the K instead, the hand makes easily. And I was hoping, based on the bidding that she had the K of hearts. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, even if she ruffs one club to set up my 5th club, she only get 3 heart pitches. 2 pitches on the K and Q of clubs, and one on the long club. So, declarer still has to take the heart finesse.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to whether 4D was too aggressive, it is border line, but certainly reasonable. Another choice by aggie might be 3S, asking me to bid 3N with a spade stopper. She does have a good hand, but probably lacks controls for slam.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My plan with aggie's hand would have been to bid 3S and then if pard does not bid 3N (I would have bid 4C as it turns out), bid 5D. But 4 diamonds might have worked out well, so I think that was a reasonable choice. If hope does not lead the ace of spades, it turns out it makes. Because, a spade loser can be elimkinated by clubs. The moral of the hand is, try for 3N instead of 5 of a minor when possible.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
EddyHaskel: should east support pard's overcall knowing they have nine spades? (and how would you bid over that)?|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
