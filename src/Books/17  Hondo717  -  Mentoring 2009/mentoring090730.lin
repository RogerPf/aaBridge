at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

JohnnyHiLo: Well unless I am unlucky no heart losers, a diamond loser and 1 spade loser. Clubs may be variable depending on what I do with clearing diamonds. 1 spade loser. I will take the diamond, draw trumps in 2 rounds hopefully and then play diamonds (losing and watching for what happens). Then ruff a diamond in hand. Play the ace of spades and low to Queens.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction here was pretty straight forward. My only comment is that even with 4 spades, if I have 3+ hearts and 6-9, I should bid 2H, not 1S. In fact even if I had more spades, I should still bid 2H. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding the play of the hand basically, johnny has 4 potential losers, 1 spade, 1 diamond, and 2 clubs He has two hopes. Either East has the K of spades, so he can play ace and another spade, setting up the Q, for a club pitch. Or he can hope the opponents give him an extra trick, which is what happened. He really should go down. At trick 5 marion, you should not play the ace of clubs. since pard played the 9, you know she does not have the K. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you should just play a low club as the 9 would remove the Q in the dummy. Remember, aces are meant to capture kings and queens whenever possible. North is known to have the king, so playing low is never wrong even if North started with Kx. You will not lose your ace, unless you think there is going to be a club pitch.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|marion played it very well. The spade ruff was unlucky. By ruffing clubs, she gave herself an extra chance in case the Q of clubs comes down, setting up the J. And failing that, she tried diamonds. Neither worked, but she maximized her chances. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss when it is a good idea to lead a singleton. It is a good idea particularly when you think you have a trump trick, as I did on this hand. However, often times, leading a singleton means you are leading a long side suit for declarer, and you could end up giving away a trick. So, you need to be cautious about leading singletons.|

In order to bid over 3C, john should really have at least a 9 or 10 Bergen Points hand otherwise, partner will put him in game, with a 15 count. He should pass, and assume pard will reopen. If pard reopens with a double, then he can bid his hearts. In this case, marion was planning on double and correcting to 3D and 3D is a good contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There were a couple of bidding errors, including one by your teacher :). 2S was fine, as was 3H. However, if I count my Bergen Points in hearts I have 11 HCP, + 1 5 card suit + 2 dummy addons for the doubletons, for a total of 14. Therefore, as one kib correctly pointed out, I should bid 4H over 3S. It is on the club finesse, which, on the auction, rates to work more often than not.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, 3S is also a bit of a risk because if marion pushes us to 4H and it makes, perhaps we would have passed 3H. I am not saying she should not bid 3S. But, beware of making a bid that pushes the opponents into a makeable game. Now, as to wbaker's bid. If the Q of spades were somewhere else, he has a clear 4H bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, you can hold it to one less, but still down 2. First let us discuss john's 3N bid. He has enough points to want to bid game, but my 3S makes it difficult for him. The problem with 3N is he only has a single spade stopper, and can only hold up 1 round. So 3N is a bit of a risk. If he had, say a six card club suit to the AQJ, and was hoping to take 9 tricks right away, then 3N would be reasonable. A negative double by john would promise at least 4 cards in the unbid major. His best bids are either 2C or 2S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, I think 5D makes.  In 3S, we lose 1S, 2H, 1 club, and 2D, down 2, so that works out well also.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2H is a better bid as spade stopper is iffy. Let me discuss first how to bid over an inverted raise. Basically, there are 2 objectives after pard makes an inverted raise. One is to find out if you have stoppers. The other is to find out if you should be in game. So, the first thing opener does is bid stoppers up the line. In this case, jana's best bid is probably 2H since her spade stopper is iffy. But 2n is not totally unreasonable, as she sort of has a spade stopper if I have as little as the J of spades. Inverted raises are off with interference.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|jana played it well. Once spades are played, jana has to take 9 tricks off the top, otherwise they will take 4 spades. She can count 5 diamonds, and 3 aces. Her best hope is the K of hearts being onside. However, with careful play by darlene, jana should only take 2 hearts, not 3. Basically, darlene should stay in parity with dummy's hearts. She could afford discarding a spades instead of heart 9 at trick 4.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The essential principle here is you need to "surround" dummy's honor if you can. Then darlene could cover the Q with the K, since she has the 10 and 9. On the other hand, if low heart played off dummy then she should play the 9. She would have the Q "surrounded" by 2 honors, so she should only cover the high honor, otherwise play the lower honor. This is a common position. If you have dummy's honor surrounded by a higher and lower honor, play the lower honor if declarer plays low.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before we play this hand let me discuss the bidding. Actually, double here is the correct bid lisa. If pard opens and there is an intervening 1N overcall, you should double with a good 8 or more balanced hand. In fact, a bid of a new suit by lisa tends to be weak, just competing. There are several ways to play over the double, which should be penalty by the way. one way is systems on, which is the easiest, and redouble as "sos." So 2C here by me is still stayman. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other way is  "redouble" as "let's look for a place to play", sort of SOS.  I prefer another method, which I call "DONT" runouts because they sort of resemble the DONT convention. With a 2 suited hand, I make a suit bid, similar to DONT. Here, with my hand having hearts and diamonds, I would bid 2D, showing diamonds and a major, just like DONT. jana would pass since she has 3 diamonds, otherwise bid 2H, with a doubleton diamond, again, just like DONT. If I bid 2C, for example, that would show clubs and another suit, and 2H would show hearts and spades. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Redouble by me would be a single suited hand, similar in concept to the DONT double. If darlene passes, jana is forced to bid 2C, and I would pass with clubs, otherwise bid my suit, again just like DONT. I like those DONT runouts a lot, but they are my own invention.|
