at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction needs discussion. Everything through 2@S is routine. However, now that the auction has proceeded, pam's hand got a lot better.  5/5 hands are powerful, and since we have found a fit, it is likely her side has a fit as well.  3@D was very reasonable. A cue bid of a major, playing Michaels, shows the other major and an unspecified minor. However, there is another treatment you can use with your hand. Your other alternative would be 2N, which suggests both minors.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, you might ask, how does that help, since you don't have both minors? If your partner understands, if des bids 3@C and you correct to 3@D, that shows diamonds and hearts. A similar treatment is when the auction goes something like 1S-P-4S-4N. The 4N ostensibly shows clubs and diamonds, but again with diamonds and hearts you can correct clubs to diamonds.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, should des bid 4@D.  I think not. pam is clearly just balancing and des has some defense, so I think pass is best.  I was very tempted to double, and in match points I would have. As to why I bid 3@S, I used my competitive bidding principles.  I know we have a 9 card fit, so I should bid to the 3 level. Given the law of total tricks, if des assumes we both have a 9 card fit, the most likely result is we are down 1 and so are they.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, they are down 2, and we make, so her bid is a wash, given I did not double. My partner should not bid 4. If I wanted to invite game, I would bid 3@H. 3@S is simply competing. Some people play a convention known as "maximal doubles" , where a double by me would show a game invitational hand. But I like to reserve that for a penalty double.  3H is a game force because you have to be able to bid 3@S to compete. therefore, to invite, you must make some other bid.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
MarDef: So, what does 3@H shows? Extra points? Another suit?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the absence of competition by pam, it would show heart cards, and ask ally to bid 4@S with a max and/or good heart fit. However, over 3@D, it is simply a game try, says nothing about hearts because I have no other way to invite. In a non-competitive auction, 3@S would be an invite, but in a competitive auction it is not.|

HT|N|AT|^K@2^Y@3You suggested 2N as one of possible bids. Would you please help clear the confusion which some of us may have.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, I can see where you would be confused. The board  you are quoting is a special exception. I will explain why it makes sense in a minute, but first let me review the general principles.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

- Are you referring to |cp|8|at|Jump|cp||at| and |cp|8|at|Non-Jump NT|cp||at|?|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Exactly. The most common case of the unusual NT is jumping to 2N over a one level opening bid. The other case is bidding 4N over a 2, 3, or 4 level major suit preempt. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

- That is easy to remember. A Jump NT in direct seat is Unusual NT. If you do not mind I would like to present several auctions based on that explanation. Would you please explain the Jump-NT bid in each example.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct. Please note, there are no intervening passes -- you are overcalling over the opponents opening bid. Typically, it shows the 2 lowest unbid suits.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct. Let me go over the  Non-Jump NT overcall which is natural, showing approximately a strong NT (perhaps a tad stronger). A 3N overcall is to play (often it shows a solid running minor and a stopper in the opener's suit).|

{|ia|,p1sp2s2n|at|}   and {|ia|,p1hp2h2n|at|}|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


AT|

- That was my original question because the 2N is a Non-Jump overcall.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me help. You are correct and the 2NT indeed is a Non-Jump overcall and you may ask so why doesn't that show a strong NT. The key is, the no-trumper originally passed. Therefore, she/he cannot have a strong NT; hence 2N must be "unusual". 

Had no-trumper not passed, 2N  would have shown a strong NT. So, once you have passed, a Non-Jump NT overcall is also unusual, since you can no longer have the strong NT.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|

- That makes sense. Is there any fine prints concerning this issue which you like to mention.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, there is. The suit overcalled by 2N is almost always a major. Since if it was a minor,  one of no-trumper's suits has to be hearts, and she/he can just overcall 2@H.  And the final point for today is in the next actual deal I played recently with one of my students. Let us go to the table.|

It calls for aggressive rather than passive defense. So I needed to switch to a club to make sure we got our club tricks before pam could run her diamonds.|

So, ally needs to know how many times to hold up her ace. To that end, I need to give her count in diamonds so she can figure it out.  On this hand it does not matter, but often it will. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me explain des's opening bid. We are playing the weak NT at these sessions. Therefore, with the strong NT, des must open one of a minor and rebid 1N  which she did. That sequence is how you show the strong NT.  BTW, in general, the convention structure is the same over weak NT as strong NT. You just have to add 3 points to responder's count. Opener is showing 3 less points with a weak NT. Therefore responder needs to have 3 more points.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a 3 part tutorial on the weak NT on my web site. The link is ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/##weaknt^*N.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me discuss two principles in this auction. In general, responder is what is known as "captain" of the hand. That means responder is usually responsible for placing the final contract, or at least giving opener a choice if appropriate. Once des bids 1N, pam knows that her side has enough points for game, since 15 + 11 = 26. Therefore, she should just bid it. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anything else may cause their side to miss game. As captain, you must take control of the auction, making forcing bids when appropriate. You are responsible for making sure your side gets to game when you know that game should be bid.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |

chaps2: If responder had bid 2@d instead of 1, would des still respond 2nt? |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You mean if responder made a weak jump shift of 2#D?
chaps2: Yes, as 1@c-P-2@d.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an interesting question. It depends on how weak your weak jump shifts can be. If they can be 2-5, which is the most common treatment, then no, not likely you have game, since partner needs specifically KQxxxx of diamonds for you to make 3N. That is why, playing the weak NT, with KQxxxxx of diamonds, responder should bid 1@D.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over the strong 1N rebid, you can play checkback Stayman or new minor forcing. Checkback Stayman means 2@C over 1N rebid asks about majors.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


AT|
chaps2: What would she have bid over 2@d? Would 2NT still show a strong NT opener?|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N over a weak jump shift should show a stronger hand than simply 15-17. -- 18 or 19 at least. Generally speaking, opener is supposed to pass a weak jump shift. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I thought the bidding was good.  ally has an interesting issue. as there is no way to show a 2 suited hand with spades and a minor over a 1@C opener. No one plays this, but I have often thought of playing a modification to Michaels which would work as follows. If you recall, over one of a major, Michaels shows 5/5 in the other major plus an unspecified minor. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, I have thought that over 1 of a minor, something similar could be done, where a cue bid of 2 of that minor would show spades and either hearts or the unbid minor. If I decided to play that, then 2@C by ally, on this auction would show spades and a red suit. However, that was just an idle thought. I have never seen that played.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, I thought pam made a very nice call over 1N. She was not sure I would take her double as takeout, and she really wanted me to bid.  So pam cue bid diamonds, which forced me to bid something. Very good pam.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, there were two issues in the play that were interesting. The first is dee's refusal to ruff with the ace of hearts. In general, that is a good play. She should try and preserve her ace of trumps to draw my trumps. Ruffing with a high trump is sometimes referred to as "|cp|8|at|ruffing on air|cp||at|", because it often gives away a trick, by allowing declarer to pitch a loser. So avoid ruffing with a high trump unless you are in a hurry to get in the lead so you can lead something else before declarer pitches other losers. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your ducks were good technique, dee, even though they happened to make no difference on this hand. But, they didn't cost you anything either.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other principle is that if only one high trump remains, there is rarely any reason to draw it. So you might as well just leave it out and go about your business of playing out the rest of the hand. If I did draw it, I would be playing 2 trumps to draw out one of dee's, and would have actually made one less trick. So, if only one high trump remains, generally leave it out and  don't bother to draw it. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|dee, did you realize that 2@S was artificial. It is 4th suit forcing. it says nothing about spades. ally is not guaranteeing anything in spades. She is simply establishing a game forcing auction. Her next bid will clarify why she bid 4th suit forcing. A bid of 2N by dee guarantees a spade stopper.|

PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If ally had spades stopped she would bid 3N. Therefore, a 3@S bid by ally is asking, saying she wants to play 3N and asking dee for a stopper. In general, if you are on your way to a possible 3N, if there is only one suit remaining, and you bid it, that asks for a stopper.  If there are 2 suits remaining, and you are on the way to 3N, bidding one of those suits says you have a stopper. But when only one suit remaining, since 3N is a possible bid, bidding that suit asks. Now I will give undo so both can bid your hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us briefly review 4th suit forcing. If you want to force to game, and are not sure where to play it, if you bid the 4th suit, that simply tells partner, "|cp|8|at|We are in a game force, please finish describing your hand.|cp||at|" For example, one reason ally might bid 4sf is if she had 5 hearts and was wondering if dee had 3 card support. Another reason might be if she lacked a spade stopper and wanted to see if dee had one. However, on this hand, it was pretty clear they should end up in 3N, so I just would have bid 3N with ally's hand.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should only bid 4th suit forcing if you have some ambiguity on the hand. On this hand, 3N seems like the best contract over 2@C, so ally should just bid it. BTW, kia BBO nickname "nome", prepared an excellent tutorial movie on 4th suit forcing. it is available on my web site under Tutorials at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss why ira should bid 4S, according to Bergen hand evaluation. My bid shows 10-12 with 3 card spade support. Using Bergen hand evaluation, ira counts 12 HCP + 1 length point for 13 starting points. Once I raise spades, he adds 2 for the singleton plus one for the 4 card club suit, for a total of 16. Since I have at least 10, we have the requisite 26 points needed for game.|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The contract is reasonable, although difficult with the bad trump break. Probably the best way to play the trump suit is to lead low towards the J9, and decide what to play, hoping to lose no more than 2 spade tricks. There was a small problem with pam's first spade play. She should play low, if ira decides to play the 8, good for him. However, if he decides to play the K, then she will get 3 spade tricks and beat the hand. Please remember the next line.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another well played hand by ira. There are two interesting principles at work on this hand. It is  optional as to whether Ira should open. He has very good points, his only Q is paired with a king. He has a 10, so opening is ok. The first principle involves whether or not Ira should bid 3@S. Typically, with an 8 card fit, he should bid 3@S. However, with 4-3-3-3 distribution, it is often right to pass. The contract is one level lower. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I usually pass with 4-3-3-3 distribution and an 8 card fit. T.he fact that you are 1 trick lower is often the deciding factor, since there are no extra ruffing tricks in ira's hand. in general, either both contracts will make or both go down. And of those where one makes, 2NT makes a bit more often than 3@S. So, I recommend pass with 4-3-3-3 distribution, both of a 2n or 3n bid by me.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other principle is whether ira should duck the 2nd diamond at trick four. In general, that is a good idea, because if ally has the ace of clubs, and diamonds are 4-3, ally won't be able to lead a diamond. However, there is another consideration here. And that is, ira needs to lose the lead one more time to establish a club trick  and, he is afraid of a heart switch. Because of that, I would probably have taken the 2nd diamond.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule is you should duck unless you are afraid of a switch. if you are, and can make the contract even by not ducking, you should not duck. In this case, a duck is probably not necessary. However, in real life, it would be hard for them to find the heart switch anyway, so most of the time it won't make any difference. Only against expert defenders. |

Another interesting deal which meets my criteria for a close format. For the first few tricks you see only South hand. Please make your defense plan before the actual player does and then read Howard's critique.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I admit, with DONT it is hard to get into the auction with a single suited minor, but if playing DONT you should probably double right away. The basic principle here is you should get into the auction early, before allowing the opponents to exchange information. Some people like to delay, to "see what is going on", but I do not generally subscribe to that theory.|
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us discuss the play a bit.  noi knows I have 4 hearts from the auction. Therefore, she should strongly suspect betty has a singleton. Therefore, she should play the ace on the first trick, otherwise, betty is going to get some ruffs, as she did.|
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The important principle here, which many less experienced players don't follow, is that the auction often gives you lots of clues as to what is going on. You need to remember the auction, and take advantage of all the available clues. In this case, the heart suit was an open book to noi.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only other issue was my suit preference. As most of you know, the size of my heart, which I know betty is ruffing, tells betty which suit to lead back. A low heart by me says lead the lower of the two non-trump suits (clubs), a high heart says lead the higher of the 2 suits (spades). Since I led the 3, it told betty to lead clubs.|

|
PG| ***** 266 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Those are two separate questions. Let me address each of them. First, Bergen only applies if partner opens, not if they overcall. The reason for that is that cue bids are available to show the strong raises So jump to 3 can still be weak, but there are other ways to show a strongish raise. So, no Bergen in this auction.|
PG| ***** 267 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Bergen applies by a passed hand. Had the auction gone p-p-p-1@H by pam, I play Bergen raises are still on.  I think many people do, but you need to double check with your partner. If you play Drury, for example, then they are not on. Since, if you play Drury, there are other ways to show the limit raises.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a few points I would like to discuss.  noi has a problem over my 1@S bid.  I think she solved it nicely by bidding 3@C. That must be showing club cards looking for 3N  because 2@C and 2@S are both heart raises. As to the play of the hand  pam needs to count her losers.  1 heart, 1 diamond, and 1 spade at most, assuming she can discard her spades. |
PG| ***** 282 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once she sees that hearts break 3-2, there is an easy line of play. Overtake the Q of hearts with the king, draw the last trump with the J, and play the Q of diamonds. This sets up the diamonds for spade pitches, and there is nothing the defense can do. Again, planning the hand out is key.|
