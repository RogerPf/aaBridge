at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The preempt did its job. 6H is an excellent contract. Let's see if there is a way to get there. First, we could make a case that charles can double. He only has 10 HCP, but his spade void is very valuable. And, qwery should double and then bid NT which is stronger than just bidding 3N right away. Often experts will bid 3N with a long running suit and a spade stopper, not necessarily a big hand. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, if qwery doubles, charles should bid 4H and that should get them to slam as well. The learning point of this hand is that the preempt made it harder, but had either east or west chosen a different action, then they still could get to six.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss possible opening leads for me. I know West is short in spades, therefore partner must have quite a few, since charles only has 5. My choices are an unbid suit, (hearts or clubs), or a trump. I will try a trump. It is quite possible that charles needs to ruff out the spade suit, so this makes it harder. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the main point here was my choice of opening leads. From the auction it was clear that West was short in spades, and pard had a lot of spades. So, when you think there are going to be ruffs, which happens when declarer bids 2 suits, and dummy shows a preference for the 2nd suit, a trump lead is often right.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That worked out very well for us. My wife Ava, who is the expert doubler in the family, would have been very impressed with North's double.  I think it was a bit light, but it certainly worked well. Please note that by playing diamonds, we shortened anne's trumps, allowing us to beat it 2. Often making declarer trump is a good defense, and it is usually passive at worst.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We see that qian planned the hand out nicely. Saw that needed to set up clubs, and needed an entry. So, the diamond play at trick one was key, because that makes the J an entry to the clubs. qian can count 4 clubs, 3 diamonds 1 heart and 1 spade to make the hand if there is an entry to the board, which is why the diamond play was good. The other possibility of course, is to hope the ace of spades is onside.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Things to talk about bidding here. Everything fine through the double and I like jana's redouble, as I said. she can bid 2C with limit raise with 4 card support, so I think the way she bid it shows limit with 3 card support. lisa should compete to 3 hearts, using the law of total tricks. She knows darlene has 4 hearts, and she has 5. they have a total of 9, so 3H is the correct bid. Always bid to the 3 level in a competitive auction with a 9 card fit.

PG| ***** 92 ***** |

^CIf you have not supported, always lead count. Tends to be more important than attitude. So lisa should lead the 4 if she plays my rules. That way darlene knows she does not have a doubleton.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, had she supported, that is a different story.
^CIn that case, low with an honor (J or higher) high from 3 small. Since had she supported, darlene knows lisa has at least 3, count not important.|

pc|C2|pc|CA|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here darlene should have played the 10 which is the correct play unless she think I have exactly the singleton Q, which is unlikely. That way I only get 1 club trick instead of 2. This is a common defensive third hand position. If dummy has an honor, and you have 2 honors which "surround" that honor (you have one honor higher and one honor lower), play the lower honor. That way if lisa gets in, she can lead another club, and I wont score the K of clubs.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a subtle but interesting way to play the hearts here. given no information on who has the Q, which is true on this hand, she should finesse jana for the Q. The reason being she can pick up 4 to the Q in jana's hand but not in lisa's assuming she wants to cash A or K first to pick up singleton queen which is the correct play. So the odds slightly favor playing jana for the Q, as there are a few more combinations where she gets all the heart tricks. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|darelene is showing game going values with a diamond stopper. With Lebensohl there is no way to show an invitational 2N hand. Basically, you either have to decide to pass or force to game when you have a 9 point balanced hand. With darelene's hand, since it was balanced I would have passed. But, recall, before we did Lebensohl she bid 3N, so all I am doing is showing how you get to 3N if you played Lebensohl. For a write up on Lebensohl, go to my web site and look at Part 3 of my weak NT tutorials at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/WeakNTPart3.pdf^*N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, despite the fact that they missed the slam, some good things happened on that hand. First of all, let's talk about what anne might do over the 2H. First we need to  count her Bergen Points. 17 HCP, -1 for singleton diamond K (although since pard bid diamonds you might not subtract 1), plus 2 length points for a total of 18 if you subtract 1. Now, once hearts are raised add 2 for singleton, 1 for extra trump, plus 1 for  4 clubs, for a total of 22. That is more than enough for slam.|
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next point is when you are missing a control, control bidding is good. But since you have controls in all suits, you can just bid 4N over 2H. You only need to control bid if you have, for example, 2 or 3 small in a suit and you might have 2 losers off the top. South's double of the 5C bid was excellent, lead directing. That talked anne out of six, because it looks to her that she is missing one ace, and will have 2 club losers on a club lead. Further, it is hard for East to know that they are missing only 1 key card so the stiff club is very important.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me talk about if anne had decided to control bid how she must do it. 3C over 2H is not a control bid. It is merely a game try. East has no way of knowing how good anne's hand is. For all he knows, she has 10 or 11 points and is looking for game. The rule is, if you want to make a control bid in a ^*Bnon-game forcing auction^*N, you have to bid past the 3 level of your suit. In this case, anne has to bid 3S over 2H. This does not deny club or diamond controls. It merely forces to game and starts a control bidding sequence. |
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she does that, then East can bid 4C, and anne will then know there are no club losers and be able to get to 6H. Let me repeat. If you are not in a game forcing auction, you must make a new suit bid past the 3 level to initiate a control bidding sequence. On this hand it turns out 3S works out well, but I would have just bid 4N with anne's hand and stopped in 5 once clubs is doubled. That's life (or bridge life at least, lol). |

HT|E|CP|8|at|^B@2^Y@3nome: |CP||AT|Mike BBO nickname "infiddle" had questions and concern regarding the auction for the previous hand. He did not have time to field them during the session. So, I sent them to Howard for clarification. Let me now have them included here as it happened during the session.|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


CP|8|at|

infidel: |CP||AT|Anne's 3c bid was *putatively* a HSGT, but when she subsequently ran past her partner's signoff to make a cue, the 3c bid becomes, retroactively, an advance cue; It lets Anne squeeze in 2 cues for the price of one, so to speak.  Anne's hand is good enough to look at slam, even if E's opening is bare-bones minimum. Personally, I would have made my advance cue in spades, not clubs, but seems to make little difference on this hand.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Thanks very much for your comment regarding this board. You raise a very good point.

On the particular sequence in question, you are right. Once Anne makes the 3S bid over 3H, clearly 3D must have been a slam try, because if it was only a HSGT, Anne would have passed 3H.

However, suppose her partner had bid 4H, and Anne really needed a control bidding sequence. Then they are at a much higher level, but it is more likely now that they should be in slam.

So, that is why I stated the rule about what constitutes a slam try/start of control bidding sequence. Assuming Anne wanted to start a control bidding sequence, she must bid past 3H to make it clear that she is making a slam try. Any bid below 3H is ostensibly a HSGT, and partner will bid 4H on many hands where you want partner to make a control bid. That is the reasoning behind my statement. 

By the way, I asked Marty Bergen about this, and he plays it the same way. In fact, I asked him about this in the context of Bergen raises. So if the bidding for example goes 1H-3C (reverse Bergen, limit raise), 3D is a general game try, 3H is to play, anything higher is a control bid.|

^-{        Writing on the sand - by nome         }
^-|HT|F|CP||FP|1|at|^B@2^Z@3B|FP||AT|ridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It take only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. Material from Howard's mentoring sessions (current and past) are my gold mine. I have been collecting them since June 2007. Next, is another "sand writing" which to the dismay of my partners I forget soon after learning it. Please click the forward arrow.|

- nome: |cp||at|This is from Howard's July 23, 2007 open mentoring session. It is on correct opening lead when partner has bid a suit. God be my withness he has repeated it many times since. However, I still stumble on the correct opening lead. Click the  ^$40 button to read more if you are with me.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|let me discuss a couple of points about my lead before leading. One of my prime rules is you should almost always lead partner's suit. I always say "You never lose the post mortem by leading partner's suit". It builds up partnership trust and is rarely wrong. The second thing is, if I have not supported partner's suit, I lead count rather than top of nothing. So I lead low from 3 small or 4 small. I think in partner's suit count is more important. If I have supported partner's suit, then I would lead top of nothing, because partner knows I have 3 or 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner has bid a suit, lead that suit. It is usually right, and even when it is wrong, it still builds partnership trust. (My rule with all partner is, if I lead their suit, I cannot lose the post mortem, even if it turns out another lead would have worked out better.) As to which card to lead, if I have not supported the suit, I lead count -- high from a doubleton, low from any three (including 3 small). If I have supported the suit, then partner knows I have at least 3, so I lead high with no honor and low from an honor.|
