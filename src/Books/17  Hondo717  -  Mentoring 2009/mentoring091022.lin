at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. The first point I like to discuss is the double by East. Typically, the double here would be takeout, showing a small doubleton club, and the other 3 suits. It is rare that East would be sure of beating the hand. Here it is only down 1 with perfect defense.|

esprit12: I though it was lead directing.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, it is really a takeout double. Setting low level contracts is very difficult, as you can see. Further, you are on lead probably if South has clubs. But granted if South does not, then ally is on lead.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|During the play, someone asked me about suit preference before and my usual carding. I play suit preference when giving pard ruff, or when obvious you don't want the suit being played led. I like standard attitude and count, and odd/even first discard.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense. qian was playing what Marty Bergen refers to as "two against one." Ally has very few points, so basically, it is qian and the dummy against ann. So, when ally gets in with her one card, she needs to make the best use of the lead and probably a diamond is the best idea. She needs to get East off the end play, and diamonds is most likely to establish tricks for their side. But all in all, a hard hand to defend. Again showing why aggressive bidding usually works.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not too bad, I think ann did the best she could. Lets talk about the auction. I don't know what drugs the dealer has been taking, but the hands have been pretty wild today. First of all, most of my long time kibs will not be surprised when I recommend ann should open that hand 2 or 3S, probably 2. But given that she didn't, she should probably pass 2D. And if qian reopens with a double, and ally passes, she can then bid 2S showing a weak hand with long spades.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By bidding spades right away, ann is showing a better hand, because she is a passed hand it is not absolutely forcing, but it is constructive. Now, once the auction goes as it did, then I think qian should double 3S. A good guide to doubling is if you have tricks in their suit, which he does. Once ally doubles 3C, he should suspect that ally has a minor suited hand and we have a misfit. So I think double is a good risk.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|
esprit12: I'm not sure I should have overcalled.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After you watch me for a while, you will see that I love preempts. 2S was a very nice bid in my opinion. Further, you may be surprised, but I think ally should consider bidding 3N over 2S. If partner has even 2 small hearts, she can count 8 tricks. And since I am a passed hand, and ann preempted, partner is likely to have some cards.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, partner has about the worst hand he could have given this auction and 3N still has plays. For example, on a spade lead, that is her 9th trick. So, this is a case where a nine trick game is better than a 10 trick game. Another possibility for ally is to bid 3H over 2S.  I am not sure I like the double.  Partner cannot have a penalty pass, and she really doesn't want to play anywhere but hearts.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I guess my 2 choices for her bids would be 3H, the more standard bid, or 3N if she wants to be daring.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a few points on this hand, but generally well done. darlene has an interesting problem over 1S, although with her great hearts I think bidding hearts is better than bidding spades. Also, because she is the one short in diamonds, she would rather play in her long suit. However, if we count her Bergen Points, she has 14 HCP, 2 length + 1 quality suit for 17 starting points. Since she has a self sufficient trump suit, she can count 4 (or at least 3) for the void. So, over 1S, 4H would not be a bad bid.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And jana's 1S and my 2D even make her hand better. Now, as to lisa's 4D bid. The bid itself is not bad, by the law of total tricks since lisa knows we have 10 trumps. But, there is a tactical issue here. Does she want to push them into 4H. I am not sure jana would bid 4H without lisa bidding 4D. Its close, she has good spades, but only 6 HCP. So that's the tactical issue. you should not bid 4D if you don't want to push them into 4 of a major.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
analisals: Doesn't a fit have to be agreed upon before she can revalue her hand or is that not ann issue with the strong hearts?|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't know for sure lisa what is going on, particularly with 4 cards in hearts, but given I passed, they likely have a spade fit or heart fit and close to enough points for game, particularly since they are short in diamonds. I am not saying not to bid 4D, I am just saying you have to consider whether or not it is good tactics.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
rq4mulae: Should W consider a cue bid (3@d) before pressing hearts without being sure of any in partner?|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, I think 3H or 4H is a much better description of her hand. West really has nice hearts.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, one comment on the defense. lisa should consider leading her singleton spade. Normally leading the opponents suit is not a good idea but with the ace of hearts, it is quite possible she can get a spade ruff, win a heart, diamond to my hand, ruff. Then we only need one more trick. However, given that she led a diamond, she should now continue diamonds rather than playing a club. Since she has relatively long hearts, it is a good idea to shorten darlene's trump holding. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had the ace of spades, darlene might even go down, since she will be out of trumps if she draws all of lisa's after 2 diamond ruffs. So, a good defensive tactic is to shorten declarer's trumps when you have some trump length.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first talk about my preempt. It is certainly a bit light, particularly given the vulnerability but it has a few things going for it. First, I have what Marty Bergen calls the ideal preempt suit, QJ10xxxx. It is ideal because it is strong enough to take tricks opposite shortness, but weak enough where it is no good on defense. And second, I have shortness in a major. Having said all that, pass is probably what most would choose. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what lisa should bid, that is interesting. She should picture me with AQxxxxx of clubs. Therefore, she can only count 9 tricks for sure, 7 clubs a heart and a diamond, maybe 10 if diamonds come in. So I am not sure if 5C should be bid but as I say, better to be aggressive than not.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what about jana. She has a problem. I would be very worried about us making 5C given her spade length and shortness in clubs. Generally, with length in your suit and shortness in the opponents suit, your tendency should be to bid, and vice-versa. And it turns out 5 spades does make, because the J of hearts is onside. But even if down 1, double is a bit risky. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more point about darlene. Leading unprotected aces is not a good idea on opening lead, as you have heard me say many times. Probably a spade lead makes the most sense, or ace of cubs and a club. I would have chosen a spade myself.|

analisals: I thought the main idea of interference was to mess up their hands, and making the bid was secondary?|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is, but if you think you are going down 2 doubled vulnerable, you need to be a bit more cautious. I don't think 5C is terrible, just needs to be carefully considered.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lots of things to discuss. First of all, the auction was fine up through 2 hearts. I have a pass and moe does as well. But I think anna has a clear 3C bid. First of all, in general, when someone opens one of a minor, they almost always have 4. Second of all, on this auction it is virtually certain I have at least 4 clubs. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why is that? I did not raise spades, so I don't have four spades. Granted, I might have 4 hearts, but that seems unlikely on this auction, with the double and free bid of hearts. Therefore I must have 4 clubs. It is barely possible I am 3-4-3-3, but very unlikely. Thus, therefore, anna can feel comfortable bidding 3C.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. dee did well to draw trumps. Then when she plays the J of diamonds (trick 4), I am obligated to give count to partner, just to let her know how many times it is safe to duck. Since I have 4, I played my 2nd highest. To be real safe I could have played the 6, but with 2 out less than the 5 partner should be able to work it out. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since she can seen the 4 and 3 missing, she should assume I have 4, and therefore dee has one. For that reason anna better take the ace. Also, since there are entries to the board, via club ruffs or straight trumps, no reason to duck.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, there was a lack of counting on both sides, which I will get to in a minute. First let us discuss the 1N opener. These days, many people open 1N with 6-3-3-2 distribution if the six card suit is a minor. I don't do it, but it is certainly within the realm of acceptable these days. The only flaw with anna's bid is her two doubletons are AJ, so the J is not full value. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand if she opens 1C, the question is, is she bidding 3C over my 1 level response. That is flawed as well, because her club suit is not that strong, so the 1N bid solves that problem. So it's just a matter of which slight distortion is better.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. anna can count 3 diamonds, probably 5 clubs at least, and a heart for 10 tricks. But she only has 1 entry to dummy. So, she should first cash her ace of diamonds before getting to dummy and then she can play her king of diamonds. Granted it sets up a trick for dee, but only 1 trick, and she is likely to make her contract unless she gets a very bad club split. That is the first part to the counting. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The second part has to do with moe at trick 5. Once dee gets in with the Q of clubs, and leads the 10 of hearts, moe needs to think about hearts especially when anna plays the J. If dee has 4 hearts, then anna has 2, and a heart continuation is right. In fact, there is really no reason to play a diamond. with 5 on the board, there is no future for the defense in diamonds.|

PG| ***** 180 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It doesn't matter moe. It is just a matter of counting. Her play is more informative. This way you know she doesn't have an honor. But she still could have 4, and if she has 3 and not the 9, so be it. The 10 probably denies a higher honor in this case, but if you think dee has an honor, even more reason to continue hearts. Basically, again, if you count the suit out, it is likely anna has 2 or 3 at most.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets talk about the discarding as anna is running clubs again, it comes down to counting. Since dummy started with 5 diamonds, and dee has 4, and she knows that moe and anna each had 2, dee can pitch her diamonds. There is no entry to dummy, so pitching diamonds can't hurt. Might as well save their major suit tricks. So 3 opportunities for everyone to count on this hand.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. Material from Howard's mentoring sessions (current and past) are my gold mine. I have been collecting them since June 2007. 

Next, is another "sand writing" which to the dismay of my partners I forget soon after learning it. This is from Howard's special session from August 13, 2007. I only bring you a small part of it. However, I recommend you down load and study the entire lesson. From Howard's web site ^*Hwww.hondobridge.com/^*N, at the bottom of the page click "All 2007 Mentoring Sessions." The file is "lesson070813.lin" third from the top.  Now, please click the forward arrow to see a portion.

at|^b@2^Y@3On partner's opening lead, your first obligation is to show attitude.  However, if it is obvious  that attitude does not apply  you should give count. For example, pard leads the A, and board has QJxx--then you give count. Playing standard, you play low from 3 (or 5), high from doubleton and  2nd highest from 4. For example, using our example, pard leads A from AK, and QJxx on board, if you show doubleton, pard will now would judge whether it makes sense to give you a ruff or not.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


AT|

Next, When playing 3rd hand high, it is imperative that you play the lowest card of a sequence. So if pard leads suit, and you have QJ10, you must play the 10. If you play the Q, pard will assume you don't have the J. Let me expand a little further.  Say there is 10 on dummy, pard leads that suit, and you have QJ9, you should play the 9. Now, a slightly more complicated example. Assume partner leads low, presumably showing an honor.  Dummy has, say Jxx, and you have K10x. Normally, you should play the 10.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


AT|

When you lead back partner's suit, you should lead back your "remaining count." So, let us say partner led a suit and you started with 3. Say board wins first trick, and you get in a little later. You now have two left in partner's suit.  So, assuming you play standard count, you should lead back the higher of your two remaining cards, to show that you have a doubleton remaining. If you started with 4, and have 3 left, you lead back low. This applies to both in suit and in no trump.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


AT|

Let me be a bit more specific. Say partner overcalled a suit, so you know she has 5. Partner leads the suit and you have 4 and dummy has a doubleton left. If you lead back low, partner knows you started with 4, so both declarer and dummy started with 2. Therefore, leading the suit a third time will give declarer a ruff and sluff. Granted, sometimes leading back remaining count does not matter, but if you get in the habit, partner will trust you when it does matter.

Now, let us play our first Board.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay North, before you lead, let me make one other point. My first cardinal rule is lead partner's suit. Secondly, if you did not support, lead count, so low from 3 small and high from doubleton. BTW, if you have supported pard lead high if you have no honor (pard will know you do not have a doubleton, since you supported the suit), low if you have an honor. Normally, you do not lead the honor if you have 3 or 4 to an honor.

UP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally as the dummy has the Jack, 8@S would be right. However, you can see nine tricks, six diamonds, so high spade should be right this time. You must take your tricks at once; otherwise, declarer will make his contract. Basically, the point of this hand is, you can see declarer has 9 tricks - 6 diamonds, 2 clubs, and a spade - if you give her the first spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct card, in this case you want to show attitude, not count. Remember, attitude first, count only if attitude is not appropriate. When West plays the A, you play the 6, if playing standard.|

North: But you said play low from 3 or 5, high from doubleton and 2nd highest from 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hopefully I can clear up the confusion. I only said that if you were showing count. However, the first thing I said was your first obligation is to show attitude on partners opening lead or on any new suit that is broken by pard. On this trick your first obligation is to show attitude. Play 6@D or 8@D

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, here is the point of this hand.  By bidding  - 1@S/2@H - I am known to have at least 9 cards in the majors. So I have 4 cards in the minors.  If I have a stiff club, then I have 3 diamonds, and you are not going to beat the contract  because I have only one club loser, one diamond loser and one spade loser. So you have to hope I have 3 clubs and one diamond. Again, you have to develop a plan on defense. Therefore, South should continue playing K@C on second trick after North played the 2 of clubs. Because playing low means having 1 or 3. Then give a @C ruff to North. The K@S would be the setting trick.
