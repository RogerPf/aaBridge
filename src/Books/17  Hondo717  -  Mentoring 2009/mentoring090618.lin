at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

UP|28|SK||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very well bid. Because kia has such a strong hand, he can open 1H and reverse into spades, bidding them twice to show 5/6. On weak 5/6 hands, it is usually better to open the 5 card suit, because you want to keep the bidding lower. and getting the 5/5 across is important. But on strong 5/6 hands, you open the six card suit. Note that I am talking about the case where the six card suit is lower ranking than the 5 card suit.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If kia had six spades and 5 hearts, he would open 1S regardless of strength. Anyway, once diane bids 1 spade, kia's hand is huge. So 4 diamonds was an excellent bid, showing the diamond shortness and extreme slam interest.  diane can bid RKCB directly with her hand, since she knows all suits are controlled, and she has more than enough for slam. But 4H as a control bid is acceptable as well.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If diane chooses to bid 4N, then kia should bid 6D, showing an odd number of key cards and a diamond void. But this makes it hard to get to 7 because it is possible they have a spade loser.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|diane, you have 4 diamond tricks. You probably have 4 heart tricks, 3 hearts by length, plus 1 ruff and one spade trick. That makes 9.  If you knock out the K of spades, that makes 11 tricks. Except then you have a club, a heart loser and a spade loser. You have 2 choices. You can hope roberta has the K of spades, and take a ruffing finesse against her. Or you can hope that roberta has the Q of clubs, and take a club trick for 10, and a second spade ruff for 11 tricks. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good diane. A little planning always helps. Luck doesn't hurt either :). This is a  very hard hand to play. But I just wanted to demonstrate that you need to come up with a plan  and that if you do a little counting, planning is possible. Even if I have the ace of spades, perhaps I will not lead a club, and the hand will make anyway.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Typically, you do not open a weak 2 in 4th seat. And, as a teaching point, lets discuss 4th seat 2 level bids. If you have a weak 2, you normally would pass. there is no point in preempting, because you are more likely to go down than not. Further, in 4th seat, the opponents would not be bidding anyway, so there is no real purpose to preempting. If you open 2 in fourth seat, you are showing an opening hand with a good six card suit. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In clubs, two losers at most, and one or two winners. To sum everything, losers first, 1 spade and 2 clubs. That's good, only 3 losers. And winners, pessimistically, 1 spade, 5 hearts, 2 diamonds and 1 club. only 9 winners. Thus, either you have to have another spade winner or another club winner.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your best line is to start a club. Once it loses to the Q, you can draw trumps and play another club. At that point, it turns out, if darlene goes up with the ace your extra winner is in clubs. If not, you have to hope clubs are 3-3 or the spade finesse is on. That is your plan. Knock out 2 clubs, and hope for extra club. failing that, try spade finesse. I know this is hard, but you have to keep trying :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not true. but I can see where you might be confused. |cp|8|at|You only need to bypass diamonds if you have a weak hand. You should not bypass diamonds if you have a good hand which is worth more than 1 bid|cp||at|. So since jana has a good hand, she can bid diamonds and take another bid to show hearts. Given darlene bid 1N, jana is right to bid 3N, because darlene is denying 4 hearts and 4 spades with her bid. In fact, on this auction, the 2 most likely distributions for darlene are 3-3-3-4, or some 5-3-3-2 hand with 5 clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If both partners bid appropriately, it is often fairly easy to figure out opener's distribution after their 2nd bid. Now, as to the play. darlene had an excellent plan. She counted 9 tricks once the Q of diamonds is out, and played appropriately.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, first lisa's 3C bid. Because you cannot open a weak 2C, some people will open 3C with only six. Since I am a big believer in law of total tricks, not what I tend to do, but that is just a style thing. So, lisa should pass. As to the play. darlene can do the following.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She can hope clubs are 2-2, and try for six club tricks. That will give her 9 tricks,  six clubs 2 diamonds and a spade. Failing that, once clubs are 4-0, without extra clubs, the best she can do is 4 diamonds, spade, and 2 clubs, which is only 7 tricks. So, her best hope is to duck a club, and hope I have the ace of hearts, so that we cannot cash our spades. That play happens to work. She will take 5 clubs, 1 heart, 1 spade, and 2 diamonds.|

My 2H bid shows 3 card support with 6-9 points. Now, lets count your Bergen Starting Points. You have 12 HCP + 1 length point for 13 Starting Points.  Once I raise hearts, you have 3 additional dummy points, 2 for singleton, and 1 for spade suit. That is 16 Declarer Points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hard hand. Bad break didn't help. Anyway, I think the bidding should be discussed. The first two bids are fine. Then I think jana should make a negative double, to show her spades. On this hand you got a plus, but on many hands we will make 1H when you can make a partial. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


AT|
JanaDe: I thought you  had to have 5/5 for a neg. double - no?|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not at all. A negative double shows 4 cards in the other major. In fact, on the auction 1C or 1D/1H, a negative double specifically shows a 4 card spade suit. A 1S bid promises 5. You have a classic negative double.|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Say the auction goes 1D-1S-x. That negative double only promises 4 hearts. You might have 5 and be too weak to bid 2H, but you often only have 4. So, a negative double only promises 4 cards in the unbid major, 4-3 in the majors at least if both majors are unbid.|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, given jana's pass, let us discuss what lisa should do. Normally, she has to make a reopening double, to protect in case jana has hearts. However, because she has hearts, jana cannot have hearts, so pass is best. Nice going lisa :) and it worked out well for you|

Because, in partner's suit, typically count is more important than whether or not I have an honor. On this hand, darlene can work out I started with 3, and jana with 2.|
