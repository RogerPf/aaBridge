^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, just a few minor points on this hand. First, note josie's  1@S overcall. In the modern style, it is a very reasonable overcall, despite her mediocre suit and only 9 points. As you know, I advocate getting into the auction as early as possible, so I would also overcall with josie's  hand, althought some would not. Also, note that because dee and I are playing the weak NT, the way she shows the strong NT is to open one of a minor and rebid 1N, as she did.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss the opening lead. In general, I still think you should lead 4th best, unless there is a good reason not to. It turned out josie's  lead was the best, but a spade would not cost anything either. That is because dee can actually afford to duck a spade and make 2, rather than just taking her 7 tricks. Defenae will not be able to take enough club tricks to set the contract, at most 4 clubs and a spade.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|hondo717: Interesting point dianne. the problem with leading the J is that partner will never work out your holding.  J from AJx is a rather odd lead. It is true that low from AJx is also strange, but at least it tells partner you have some honors.  I guess my point was I would not lead the suit to start with.

@D@Dnome:As usual you can play this hand and others double dummy. Do it before clicking hte forward arrow.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|josie's pass is reasonable, but 2@S is also acceptable. With 5 HCP and a doubleton, she has at least 6 dummy points, and with 3 spades to the Q, I think more people would bid 2@S than not. Makes it harder for us to force them up to 3@S  had josie bid 2@S.  I have a clear balance, as it is almost never right to let the opponents play at the one level.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us discuss the defense the opening lead and the defense. Although I am generally against leading aces, dee's ace lead is reasonable, since I did bid the suit. Her other 2 choices are a trump or a diamond.  A trump could very well be right, because she has 4 hearts, and it sounds like josie might be short in hearts.  I might very well have chosen a trump, but as you can see, that doesn't work out well for us, as it gives elizabeth a free finesse.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After  she led the ace of clubs, dee now has a clear diamond shift  because I have to have 5 clubs, she knows that elizabeth is out of clubs. And since elizabeth also bid hearts, hearts is probably not a good lead. Therefore,  she should dollow her opening lead with a diamond, and hope to set up diamond tricks for us. Even if I have as little as the 10, it does not cost anything, and if I have the 10 and another honor, it works out very well.|

UP|32|PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lots to discuss on this hand. First, let me start with the bidding.  dee does not really have an opening hand, as it does not meet the rule of 20.  4-3-3-3 hands with 12 HCP and no aces are not really good opening bids.  But assuming dee opens, elizabeth has 2 choices of bids.  She can either bid 1@H as she did. Another alternative is the unusual 2N, showing 5/5 in the 2 lower unbid suits (hearts and diamonds in this case.)  I think I personally would have chosen 2N, but 1@H is certainly acceptable.  1@S is the correct bid by josie.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, dee should realize that josie has 5 or more spades, because with exactly 4 spades josie should make a negative double. Therefore, dee should probably choose 2@S rather than 1N, particularly since her hearts are rather weak.  Now, let us discuss josie's original rebid of 3@S. The question is, is 3@S forcing?  I would play it forcing. However, since dee did bid 1N, I think 4@S by josie is reasonable  and 4S should make.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|josie should test spades by playing the ace from her hand first. Since elizabeth bid 2 suits, if spades break 4-0, I will be the one with 4 spades. However, even after playing the spades the way she did, josie can still make the hand easily. She plays 3 rounds of spades, leaving the J of spades in my hand.  She then plays 3 rounds of clubs, pitching a diamond. In the end she loses a diamond and a spade, and makes 5.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
joseye: I started messing around leaving spades for later.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well best if you draw 3 rounds of trump so that I can't score my low trump, as I did. Based on the auction, you should realize I have a singleton heart. It is very important to take clues from the auction when you play or defend. Many players don't do that, but it is a very important habit to develop.

@D@Dnome: Don't forget to play this hand double dummy before clicking the forward arrow. Further, click you cursor on the table to finish the trick instead of clicking the forward arrow. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again both the bidding and play need discussion. First of all, the question is, should elizabeth open 1N or 1@S. The modern tendency is to open 1N with any 15-17 balanced hand. So most people would open 1N with her hand. On the other hand because the spade suit is very strong, you could make a case for opening 1@S opening. However, the reason it is usually better to open 1N is that the most likely response is 1N which makes the wrong side play the contract.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only comment I have is trick one, when josie led a club. The club lead was fine josie. You have no real good lead, and the club could work out well. The question is, what should elizabeth play. Since you led the 10, elizabeth knows that josie does not have the J. If dee has the KJ, then it doesnt matter what elizabeth plays from dummy. But in case josie has the K, elizabeth should indeed go up, as it is a no lose play. Either it doesn't matter or it will win the trick. Playing low will never gain a trick, unless dee misdefends.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, let us first discuss josie's preempt.  Technically, josie's hand is strong enough to open 1@D.  However, there is a good tactical case to be made for opening 3@D. She is very short in the majors, so it is likely the opponents have a major suit fit. So 3@D makes it harder for them to find their major suit fit, and get to the right level. And it turns out, that if elizabeth manages to ruff all 3 diamonds in dummy, she can make 4 hearts. On the other hand, since elizabeth was only in 3, her line of play was fine as well particularly, since it is likely I have the ace of clubs. As josie preempted, it is not likely she has 2 aces, although it turns out in this case she does.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sorry josie, I forgot, I was supposed to let you play the hand. I hope you get another chance next week. Now, let me discuss this hand and my bidding and play approach. First, Yes to your question josie you should definitely pass josie.  Technically, I have a double and  correct. However, I am very worried that if I double, josie will jump in spades. And since my suit is a minor suit, it is less likely we have a minor suit game. So I chose to bid 2@D. If josie had bid spades, I was thinking about bidding 3N. On the other hand,  double and correct would also be fine, in fact technically that is what I should have done. As to the play, generally, I should only make 4, losing a spade a diamond and a club. However, I was lucky that dee chose to throw her clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My club play illustrates what is known as "the law of restricted choice." This law applies when you are missing the Q and J and have the A, K, 10, and 9 in  a suit, if you play a high honor and the Q or J appears, you should assume that it is a singleton, and play the other person for the other honor. Ihis case, in trick 8, when elizabeth throws the J under the ace of clubs, I should play dee for the Q.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, first the bidding. Everything is fine through 2@D.  3@H is not totally unreasonable by pam, as she has a 7 trick hand (5 hearts and 2 aces), but a little aggressive.  It is unlikely I have more than one trick for her. And  that is why it might be a good tactic, as you are down 2 at worst probably. |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss the defense a little.  I think a club lead is reasonable by des. Unfortunately, it doesn't turn out to be a good lead. However, des should lead the 8 of clubs rather than low, to deny an honor.  On this hand it doesn't matter, since dee has Kx anyway, but it might on other hands. Further, because des did not lead a diamond, dee should figure out des is void.  Once des gets in and leads 2 spades, and dee then gets in, at trick seven, she should play diamonds, not clubs.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No reason to play a club back, dee needs to cash one diamond, and hope she sets up a trump trick in des's hand. However, once the club lead is made, pam always makes 3.  Since dee didn't cash a diamond, pam can cash another club and pitch her losing spade, and thus make 4.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other point about the play. at trick 2,  pam should start with the K of hearts, thereby not using up her ace of spades to get back to her hand. If she does that, she can draw trumps and make 4 or 5 for sure. With KQJ108, she can afford to pitch the 9 under the K so she can keep leading trumps without having to lose control of spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, we need to talk about the play after the bidding.  1C bid was fine. I don't like my double, but I felt I had too many points to pass. Further, you need to be at least 4-3 if both majors are unbid, and I did have good cards in both majors.  dee should really just pass.  She has 5 HCP, and since I am showing spades, and she has such bad spades, there is really no reason for her to bid. |

PG| ***** 150 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not really a worry, for several reasons. First of all, my double is takeout, so pam is likely to bid, and if she passes, des gets another chance to bid anyway. Second, in general, even playing the strong NT, about 85% of the time, des will have at least 4 clubs. And, third, playing the weak NT, des usually has a 5 card club suit when opening 1C. If she has the balanced weak hand with 3 clubs, she would open 1N. Finally, if she has the strong NT, she can always rebid 1N if necessary.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, you have 8, I have an opening hand, we probably have an 8 card heart fit. It is possible I have only 3 hearts, but particularly given the auction, that is unlikely. The only thing I would be worried about is spade ruffs by des, since we must have at least a 7 card spade fit. So, I would choose 2@H bid anyway.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play. pam, should win the first spade in her hand  and take the heart finesse right away, she should be worried about spade ruffs. When that wins, she should probably play the ace of hearts next, to minimize ruffs by des. That turns out to work very well. If she does that, and draws the third round of trumps, she ends up losing 2 diamonds and 1 club (because she can get back to her hand with spades and pitch dummy's club on spades and makes 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is one problem when you play with me as a partner. I put you in some difficult contracts :).  5/5 hands are very powerful, as this hand proves.  my 4@H bid was aggressive, but even with ira's 4 HCP, we still made the contract (granted with skill and some luck.) but more skill than luck. One lesson here is, be particularly aggressive with distributional hands, such as 5/5 hands. Another lesson is that, you can play Michaels over a weak 2, or even a 3 preempt.  |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 3@D bid is Michaels, showing at least 5/5 in the majors. As you all know, you can bid Michaels over a preempt, in fact it is often a useful bid. However, unlike over a 1 level opener, where the opponent has a good hand, and the Michaels bidder need not have a good hand when you bid Michaels over a preempt, you need to have a good hand. |

{Michaels}  is a cue bid overcall of opener's suit for example:

^-|CS|4|CP||at|^C@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|n terms of point ranges, there is not universal agreement. However, many people play what is known as |cp|8|at|"good-bad"|cp||at| Michaels (and the same treatment could be applied to the unusual NT). They play that Michaels either shows a bad hand (|cp|8|at|no more than 9 HCP|cp||at|) or a good hand (|cp|8|at|more than 16 HCP|cp||at|). With an intermediate hand and the appropriate 5/5 shape, the overcaller simply bids his higher ranking suit. The reasoning behind this is that, with the bad hand the Michaels bidder is planning to pass whatever suit partner chooses; with a good hand, the Michaels bidder is planning to jump to game in whatever suit partner chooses.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


CS|4|FP|2|AT|^-

{Michaels can also be played over preempts}
^-|FP||CS||AT|

It is particularly useful over minor suit preempts. A cue bid over a minor suit preempt shows at least 5/5 in the majors, and asks partner to bid his best major. Typically, you should have a pretty strong hand (|cp|8|at|at least 14 points in the 2 suits|cp||at|), because, even over a weak 2@D, you are forcing the bidding to the 3 level, and over 3@C/3@D you are forcing the bidding to game. You can also bid Michaels over major suit preempts, but often an overcall of the other major is more useful. You have to use your judgement.|

|HT|n|AT|^C{|ia|,4s4n|at|} |HT|m|AT|^N@2^Y@3 ostensibly shows at least 5/5 in the minors, and enough strength to be willing to play at the 5 level. Responder chooses their better minor.|

^C@2^Y@3Over spades, you can also bid 4N with hearts and diamonds, as in
|HT|t|AT|^C{|ia|,4s4n|at|}|HT|S|AT|^N@2^z@3
because you can correct 5@C to 5@D, and partner will realize you had hearts and diamonds rather than diamonds and clubs. Some people play that 4N over a 4@s preempt shows any 2 suiter (clubs/diamonds, diamonds/hearts, or clubs/hearts). If you play that, responder should only bid 5@D if he can tolerate playing in hearts (in case responder has the club/heart hand).|

Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
