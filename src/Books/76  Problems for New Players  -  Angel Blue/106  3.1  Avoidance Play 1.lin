fp|1|cp|2|
ht|g|at|^bWhen a defender threatens to run a long suit against you, there is an obvious danger.|
ht|h|at|^bThe idea is to keep the danger hand off lead, so it is important to know who is the danger hand and why.|
ht|i|at|^bYour first goal is to correctly identify the dangerous opponent and to recognize the way he can damage|
ht|j|at|^byour game. Next you should try to find out what might be the effective way to prevent the danger hand|
ht|k|at|^bfrom gaining the lead.|
ht|m|at|^bA Guideline for all the hands included in this movie:|
ht|n|fp|1|at|^bBe always on the look-out whether or not a defender may risk your game by taking control of the led suit|
ht|o|at|^bor by shifting to a vulnerable suit.| 
ht|q|at|^bBefore playing to trick one, recognize the dangerous opponent. This will give you the ideas about:|
ht|s|at|^c1. Whether or not it is essential to hold up to exhaust the short-suit holder of his cards in the led suit.|
ht|u|at|^c2. How to proceed with your play to prevent the dangerous opponent from gaining the lead.|

ht|f|at|As each deal progresses you will be shown:  your hand, the bidding, the lead and then given a chance to think about your plan.

When you now click  { ^*b Flow  > ^*c } or better still use your mouse wheel (or trackpad) to SCROLL forward one place, the  { ^*b 1st > ^*c }  button becomes visible.  This means you can play the hand against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots.

When you have finished, click the  { ^*b Back to Moive ^*c }  button which will return you to where you were in the tutorial.

The first time you play the hand you have do so without any extra assistance from aaBridge, this mode of play is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n plays as much as you like.   

|n^|9|at|After that you get a second chance to play the hand but this time you have access to the ^*b DDS ^*n (Double Dummy Solver) and other features such as; making all the hands visible.

It is not a safe plan to hold up in spades. When spades break 5-3, West can hold up his @SA on the second round to preserve communications. Then, if a @d finesse subsequently loses to either hand, the defenders will take a total of four @s tricks to beat the contract. 
^fWin the opening lead, cross to Dummy's @DK and run the @DJ into the safe West hand.

Hold up twice to clarify the club position. Since West is the dangerous hand, the safer option is to run the @HJ.  If it loses, the suit is established, and you have nine tricks. If the heart finesse wins, return to hand with a high spade and cash the @HA.  If the @HQ has appeared, you get an overtrick.  ^^^eIf West proves to hold @HQxxx, cash your other top @s and hope the Queen drops.
