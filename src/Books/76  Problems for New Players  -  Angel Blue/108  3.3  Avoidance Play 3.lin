tu|y|

fp|1|cp|2|
ht|f|at|^bAn avoidance play might occasionally be a lead through a hostile control, planning to gain a trick in|
ht|g|at|^ba suit if the opponent wins the trick with his control, and a tempo if he does not.|
ht|i|at|^bUnlike all other forms of avoidance play in which we manage the play in such a way that PREVENTS| 
ht|j|at|^bthe dangerous hand from gaining the lead, in the present form we GIVE the dangerous hand a chance|
ht|k|at|^bto gain the lead but he has to pay an expensive price for doing that.|
ht|m|at|^bThis form of avoidance play is used when you, as declarer, cannot prevent the dangerous opponent|
ht|n|at|^bfrom gaining the lead.|
ht|p|at|^bIn the most common situations of this play, you lead a low card through a defender's Ace. If he plays| 
ht|q|at|^blow, you score one trick and a vital tempo without losing the lead to the dangerous opponent.|
ht|r|at|^bIf, instead, he rises with the Ace, he beats thin air, giving you an extra trick.| 
ht|t|fp|2|at|^bA Guideline for all the hands included in this movie:|
ht|u|fp|1|at|^bIdentify the  dangerous opponent – the defender who may risk you by attacking your vulnerable holding.|
ht|w|at|^bTry to locate the missing Aces by inference (e.g. from the bidding) or, lacking any information, locate|
ht|x|at|^bthem, mentally, in where you need them to be for your contract to succeed. This will give you the idea|
ht|y|at|^babout how to proceed with your play to cause the dangerous opponents to pay for winning a trick in a suit.|

When you now click  { ^*b Flow  > ^*c } or better still use your mouse wheel (or trackpad) to SCROLL forward one place, the  { ^*b 1st > ^*c }  button becomes visible.  This means you can play the hand against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots.

When you have finished, click the  { ^*b Back to Moive ^*c }  button which will return you to where you were in the tutorial.

The first time you play the hand you have do so without any extra assistance from aaBridge, this mode of play is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n plays as much as you like.

You have five major tricks and need to establish four from the minors. If you start with @ds, West, after winning the Ace will draw your last @s stopper, and later, after winning the @CA, will grab three @ss to beat the contract. The same will happen if you play the @CQ first. To ensure your game you must play the @C7 first. If West jumps with his Ace, you rightfully earn your game. If West ducks, switch peacefully to the @ds.
