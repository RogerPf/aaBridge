nt|^z@3^b@2^^|MB|X|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North cannot double as that shows diamonds. Doubles of artificial bids are lead directing, and always show the suit bid. I would also be somewhat cautious with the North hand although it has some strength it has several flaws. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In particular the @SK is likely to be worthless, since 1@S was opened on the North's left. It so happens to be useful on this hand, but based on the auction that is pretty unlikely in general.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|NS are vul and EW are not vul, so North is taking a big risk in getting doubled. And with no singletons or voids, the North hand is not that good anyway.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree the suit is not wonderful but with a 9-card fit it is not as bad as with an 8-card fit.All considered, there is a possibility that EW have enough for game since 17 + 9 = 26. But given that West needs a max, no wasted club points, and some nice spades I think 3@S is fine.|

But besides the reasons I already listed as to why not to bid here is another consideration. We might have a 9-card fit but it is unlikely we have a 10-card fit. So the Law Of Total Tricks says pass is correct.|mb|P|

sk|e|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the winners, East has likely 4 spades (although maybe only 3), 3 diamonds, 2 hearts, and a heart ruff is 10. So it turns out 4@S is not a bad contract although the heart lead was fortunate.|

East probably doesn't have 4 hearts and West certainly doesn't have 4 hearts. At worst we have a 7-card fit and could easily have an 8-card or even 9-card fit.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 2@H bid worked out well. Tough hand to play with the 4-1 break. We probably don't make 2@H. Not sure West should bid 3@D but based on the auction West can figure out we probably have an 8 card heart fit. So 3@D has some merit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, East should duck the first heart. It rates to lose. It's going to lose anyway and then East has 2 heart tricks. That makes the rest of the hand easier to play.|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand the @HJ wins. So East can now play a club and end up taking 5 diamonds, 2 hearts, 1 club, and 1 heart ruff for 9 tricks.|
