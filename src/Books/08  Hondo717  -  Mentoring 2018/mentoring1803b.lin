UP|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East forgot an important declarer principle. That is "lose your losers early" before running out of trump. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Rather than rushing to ruff a diamond, he should first play clubs and spades to knock out our winners. In that fashion East could retain control of the diamond suit, while keeping his trump and making 5.|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2nome: Naturally, I only look to make the contract and not for additional tricks. That is an innate anxiety which I should drop in order to become a better declarer.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well that is fine, but there is no reason not to start on clubs (or spades) before playing diamonds. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your diamond ruff will be there later, once you lose the @CA and @SQ. The way East played it, he ended up running out of trump before you set up a spade trick. There was no reason for that to happen.So remember, don't rush to shorten yourself in trump.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Starting with spades was fine. But then once that doesn't work he should duck a club rather than playing diamonds and hope clubs split 3-3. And it turns out they do. So he can make 1NT.|

As to whether to open 1@C or 1@D the modern theory is to open 1@D with 4-4 in the minors regardless of strength. However, some older players use "better minor" meaning they would open 1@C with West's hand.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out if North leads a major we take the first 7 or 8 tricks. But the club lead was correct on the auction. It will be right more often than wrong. And bridge is a game of percentages. If you make the percentage play, you will do better than if you don't.|

Even if you play short club, you MUST NOT respond with a very weak hand, regardless of club length. On this hand it would work out badly because partner would rebid 2N.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points I probably balance with a double. But in IMPs, if you have no clear balance, often passing out 1 of a minor is not a bad result. However, since Movie Maker is my partner, I will double.|mb|D|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, my balance did not work out. Would have been as good or better, letting them play 1@C. When it goes 1@C-P-P, that is a rare time when you only balance when you have the hand for it and my double was marginal at best.|
