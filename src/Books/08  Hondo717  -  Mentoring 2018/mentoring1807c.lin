And North needs to be cautious as well. North has 4 spades. So it is likely I am short in spades but I didn't bid over 1@S. So I probably don't have much or if I have spades its fine to defend.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I didn't bid 3@C because of the void in partner's suit. But 3@C "has merit". And it does make, because declarer will take 6 clubs, 2 diamonds, and the @HA. So perhaps not bidding 3@C was a bit too conservative.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a bit lucky although it wasn't a horrible contract. The fact that clubs split 7-2 instead of 5-4 helped a lot and that I had no entries.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unclear what diamond should North lead. A low diamond has some merit. The @DK asks for me to signal attitude. If I have a doubleton diamond and get in, then I can lead to North's diamonds. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @DA is not a good lead in NT unless it is the top a solid suit such as AKQxx. The @DA lead asks me to a) unblock an honor and, failing that, b) give count. You only lead the ace when you have a solid suit usually 6 card suit or occasionally 5.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, North was a bit lucky. If I were East, given the auction I might double 2@D. Partner promised diamonds with the 1NT bid and N/S don't do too well in 2@D. We take 3 diamonds, 1 club and 1 heart for down 3 and might only get 2 diamonds.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As everyone knows, I believe in aggressive bidding  but you still have to be aware of auctions that call for caution. Most players are too cautious.|

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East doesn't have exactly a min but her hand is not all that great, particularly with balanced distribution, for 2N. Here 2NT should show a pretty good hand asking partner to bid 3NT with 9 or even a good 8. It is not simply competing.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And based on the auction West has a clear 4@H bid and not 3@H. West has 12 Starting Points--10 HCP 2 length points. And assuming, it was a good 2N bid, East has to have something in hearts to bid 2N. So 4@H seems pretty clear.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if I were West I would have bid 2@H over 1@S even playing 2/1. When you have hearts, since 2@H promises a 5-card suit, it is okay to stretch over 1@S when you have nice hearts and bid 2@H even if you are a tad below a game force--12 starting points.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted it only adds to 19 using the Rule of 20. So it's not quite a game force. But as I said, it's okay to stretch a little if you can bid 2@H over 1@S.|

A hand with 6-4 distribution, not that much defense, and a terrific heart suit (worth 4 tricks even opposite a void) is a great hand to pre-empt.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2nd seat, you should be a little more cautious about preempting than in 1st or 3rd because in 2nd seat, it is more likely that you will preempt partner.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You certainly should preempt in 2nd seat. But since one opponent has passed it becomes more likely that your partner is stronger since one opponent is known to be weaker. That is why you need to be a little more disciplined.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, you need to be very aggressive because if you have a weak hand, and both other players have a weak hand, you know 4th seat has a strong hand. So you need to make life as difficult as possible for 4th seat. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, I definitely open the North hand 3@H. In 1st seat, not vul, I would also open the North hand 3@H. However, I might only open 2@H against a less experienced pair because opening 3@H in 1st seat does mess up partner's law of total tricks calculation.|mb|2H|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. This was a pretty straight forward hand. My only other comment was that, when partner preempts, if you have a fit for partner, it is rarely wrong to play in partner's suit. 3NT occasionally might work out better in Match Points. But 4 of the major opposite a weak 2 is just about always oayk as well.|

PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I do like my 4-5-3-1 distribution. But I only had 3 HCP and a weak 5-card suit. Further, we are vul and they are not. If the @SQJ were in my 5-card heart suit instead making my hearts stronger I might bid 2@D transfer.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But because of all the negative factors I discussed I think a pass is best (although I am not happy about it). Again, you should be aggressive, but there are times when you should pass.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BWest:^*N I am not familiar how to respond so if I bid 2@H does partner correct to Spades?|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. You pass here. You want to play 2@C because you have 3+ clubs (first suit in DONT bid by Partner).|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that you can make 4 of a major if East's other suit is a major. But it is likely to be diamonds. So you should pass with your hand.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|DONT is designed to find a 2-level partial which is usually just fine. Occasionally you do miss a game but since the 1NT opener is strong it is very rare that you miss a game and DONT lets you compete on many hands.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BEast:^*N Is the first suit bid always longer?|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, it shows the suit bid and a higher suit. It can be 5-4 or 5-5. So with 2@C it can be clubs and any other suit.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 2@D the other suit has to be a major. And with 2@H it is obviously hearts and spades since spades is the only higher suit.|

I could lead a spade but with cards in the other 3 suits cutting down on ruffs is probably best.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So when in doubt, if one opponent has shown a 2 suited hand and the other opponent has shown a preference which is exactly what happened on this auction a trump is often the best lead. You definitely want to pull trump.|pc|C9|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand can be made. After knocking out a red ace, all East needs to do is duck a spade. And then East will take 4 spade tricks, 2 heart tricks, and 2 club tricks. Count your winners and figure out how to come to enough tricks to make the hand.|

mb|1D|mb|2S|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would bid 2N with the West hand. Yes West does not have hearts stopped but it is likely partner does. Similarly, over 2N, even if North bids 3@S I would have bid 3N with the East hand.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West had bid 2N, again, from East's point of view clubs are a bit of a worry. But partner is likely to have a club stopper. And no, you should not worry about hearts. If partner had hearts, he would have made a negative double. Since he didn't you don't worry about hearts.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@D is fine. The only problem is a question of tactics. You need to worry about whether or not I am going to bid 4@S and whether you like that or not. On this hand, you probably don't mind if we bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BEast:^*N So I should pass?|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not here. You have a hand that screams it wants to play in diamonds. Your spade void is really nice on offense. Voids are "magic" in that hands with voids are wonderful on offense and take many more tricks than you might think.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@D was fine. I would be more worried about missing 5@D than not making 4@D. But now you can see why it would have been better if West had bid 2N. Passing and awaiting developments always causes problem.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is fine. It is a slam try but you can't be too strong.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


mb|D|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|mb|5D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East hates the fact that partner has spades. So 5@D shows no slam interest.|

UP|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the bad fit, 5@D doesn't make and 3N won't make on perfect defense e.g. North leads a heart and south returns a club. But in real life, North is leading a spade against 3N and East will take 7 diamonds and 2 spades and make the hand.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play of this hand, after taking the 2 spades, East's only hope is that hearts are 3-3 and North has the @HA. So after cashing 2 spades and discarding clubs East should play a heart.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, it doesn't matter. But if hearts were 3-3 and North had the @HA then East would make 5@D. There was no chance to make the way it was played.|
