cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West knows that East will ruff the next diamond. Here it turns out not to matter but it might have. Further, East should have been paying attention to the diamond spots and realize the missing spots are the J10764. And determine the @D4 would definitely is lowest. However, the @D6 is not clear because it is not clear what diamonds West has|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, when you lead a suit for partner to ruff, the size of the spot you lead back is suit preference. So if West leads back the lowest diamond, the diamond 4, she would want the lower of the 2 remaining suits (clubs) led back.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she leads back her highest diamond (although East cannot necessarily tell in this case it is her highest diamond) that means West wants the higher of the remaining suits (hearts) led back.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's do some analysis to see whether North should bid 3@S. I did not open a weak 2, therefore, I should not have 6 spades. So by the Law Of Total Tricks we have an 8 card fit.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My competitive guidelines say you should only bid "3 over 3" with a 9-card fit or a singleton in the opponents' suit and North has neither.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, theoretically North should not bid 3@S. But with such a nice hand I can't say I blame North that much.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's see how 3 hearts does. They do pretty well actually. They take 7 heart tricks and 3 tricks in the minors. The 4@H contract makes but hard to bid it.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question raised whether West shoud bid 4@H had East bid 3@H instead of 2@H.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But remember East had a weak jump shift showing 7 hearts and no more than 4 HCP and often fewer. Admittedly, if East had opened 3@H I would bid 4@H with the West hand. But not sure after a weak jump shift, which is usually weaker than an opening 3 bid that I would bid 4.|

You should not overcall 1NT without a stopper when the opening bid is 1@H or 1@S.   And you should be somewhat cautious even over 1@D.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But 1@C is sometimes short. So if you have no better call than 1N, even without a club stopper, you shouldn't worry too much about overcalling 1NT over 1@C without a stopper. Here I think double is better. 

But if, for example, I had 2 hearts, or perhaps 3 little I might overcall 1NT rather than double.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2@H balance worked out well for us. 2@S by West was okay. It just did not work out so well but it is a reasonable call. Further, it is unclear whether East should go back to 3@C.|
