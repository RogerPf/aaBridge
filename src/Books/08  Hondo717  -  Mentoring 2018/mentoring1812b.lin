mb|P|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|P|mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is fine. But let's discuss it as there are differences about it among experts. Since North is a passed hand 1@S is certainly not forcing. However, if North were not a passed hand there is some disagreement as to whether or not 1@S is forcing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally, new suits by RESPONDER (partner of opener) are always forcing. However many experts play new suits by ADVANCER (partner of an overcaller) are not forcing. Personally I like to play it as forcing. And regardless of whether or not it is forcing, it should show some values (at least 8 or so). |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you don't play it forcing, then, the only forcing bid North can make is 2@C. But I like 2@C to be a limit raise. That is why I think you should play new suits as forcing. Not to mention, it is easier to remember since now new suits by responder/advancer are always forcing. So I would play 1@S as forcing were North not a passed hand. Anyway, here 1@S was fine.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I would not double with the East hand. First of all it is not clear that it shows hearts. And 2nd of all even if it does West had the opportunity to bid hearts and did not. So West either doesn't have 4 hearts or was too weak to bid them. In either case why ask for partner to bid hearts?|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When the auction goes   1@C - 1@D - neg X    that specifically shows both hearts and spades. With just one major, responder could and should bid it over 1@D.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

^*BEast: ^*NEven with only 4 cards?|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, why not? 

Don't get confused with the auction  1@C  or  1@D-1@H-X.   There you can use a negative double to differentiate between 4 spades and 5 spades. But that is just a convenience. Over 1@D, a bid of 1@H or 1@S only promises 4 cards.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 2@D was natural and you should raise to 3@D. Also not sure why West doubled.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth:^*N After West doubled I decided to pass. I understand I should have bid 3@D.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure why West doubled. But you should have bid 3@D unless you want to let them play 2@H or 3@C. if you don't, then bid 3@D so they don't discover their fit.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need an agreement as to what 4N means here. Personally I like to play it as RKCB for hearts. However, many experts would play it as quantitative. But if you do, then how do you do RKCB for hearts in this bidding?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest^*n: I want to do Quantitative.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well that is nice. But you have a 4-card spades, suppose partner had bid 2@S. Now would you want to do quantitative or RKCB ?   Surely, you want to play in spades if partner has 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this and similar bidding cycles you have 2 choices as to how to play 4N. Personally, here, I like to play it as RKCB for hearts. I think that is better.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people solve the RKCB problem as 4N after a major suit response to Stayman is quantitative and 4@C is RKC for the suit bid. So, playing that, if West wanted to bid RKC for hearts then West would bid 4@C. And use the same response structure (4@D = 0-3, 4@H = 1-4, etc.).|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you do that you give up the ability to splinter. You just have to decide. Personally to keep things simple I am not a big fan of quantitative. There are too many ambiguous auctions where it is not clear whether or not 4N is quantitative or RKC.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear what North should lead. And K from KQx (as opposed to KQJ or KQ10) does not always work out well, so I avoid that lead if there is a better one. But on this hand, North really does not have a better lead.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The trump lead might work out okay. But, because of the auction, it is very possible that declarer has a 7-card (or even 6-card fit) so leading the J from Jx could easily help declarer. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It happens not to hurt on this hand, but not leading a heart cost the defense a tempo. As you will see later in the play, declarer was able to discard a losing heart on a club.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 2nd choice, should I not choose to lead a heart, would be a diamond. However, even if you play top of nothing leads (and I, and most experts, prefer count leads even with 3 small), leading the @D10 could cost a trick so I would avoid doing so. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So playing top of nothing, I would not lead a diamond since I don't want to lead the @D10 and leading the @D4 is too ambiguous. If I played count leads, leading a low diamond is okay, but I still prefer a heart lead.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's move onto the club play. When declarer leads the @C10, North should duck smoothly. North might be worried about declarer having a singleton clubs. That is unlikely. If declarer has a singleton club, then South has 4 clubs and probably would have raised clubs. |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And even if declarer has a singleton club, ducking the club at worst trades tricks. When North plays the CA, that sets up 2 tricks for declarer. If North ducks and declarer has a singleton club, then declarer only takes 1 club trick. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So at worst, ducking the club is a wash. 2nd hand low is right almost all of the time, unless you can beat the contract by playing high. If in doubt, play 2nd hand low smoothly.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, regardless of the lead, declarer is likely to take 8 tricks. Even if North leads the @HK and ducks the 1st club, declarer has 5 spades, 1 heart, and 1 club for sure. That is 7 tricks. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And it would be very difficult for the defense to avoid giving declarer either an extra diamond or an extra club trick. But between the opening lead and taking the @CA immediately, the defense made it easy for declarer to take 8 tricks.|

AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With more than a min hand, 8 HCP and a 6 card suit, North needs to bid 3N. I am showing around 18. North's hand is worth 10 Bergen Points if you add 2 for the club length which is enough to bid 3N.|mb|3N|

PC|S4S5S2SK|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*yIs this play by declarer correct?^^n|cp|8|
AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 9 tricks ^*B  so long as clubs are 3-2^*n    five clubs, two spades, and two diamonds. As we can see North has to set up clubs. Suppose the club finesse loses. Then how is North going to get to his hand to run clubs if you take the @SK immediately?|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If it does, North can never get to his hand to run your club tricks. North need to plan the hand before playing to trick 1 and make sure you have an entry to get there.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We talked about making a plan at trick 1. Now let's see why West should strain to overcall at the 1 level with a good suit. East would lead a heart had West overcalled 1@H. Had East led a heart (@H2) the hand might actually go down.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming West overcalls 1@H East leads the H2 (count)and the plays would be:|
