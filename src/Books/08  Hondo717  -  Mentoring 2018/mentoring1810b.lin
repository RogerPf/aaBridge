UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a lot of comments about the bidding in particular. 1@C was obviously fine. It is not clear as to what North should do. A diamond preempt might work but we also might have game in hearts even though I am a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My choices for the North hand are 1@D, 3@D, or double. The hand is strong enough to double and correct if I bid spades. But it could be a problem if I jump in spades which is certainly possible.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with preempting, as illustrated here, is that North is way stronger than partner expects. Because North preempted, I didn't double. Had North bid 1@D I would double 4@S.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The preempt does give East a problem. I don't hate double. Double either shows both majors, or 1 major and club tolerance (suit that West opened). Pass is also possible.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is hard to say whether I could bid 3@D. I don't have much and I don't like being vul. But it looks very much to me that EW have a heart fit. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, we do have a 10-card fit, so I have extra protection with the Law Of Total Tricks. So I decided 3@D was aggressive but not that dangerous as we were unlikely to be doubled.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure why West doubled. I guess you could play that is asking East to pick a suit. But with such nice spades and the singleton diamond I think 3@S is probably best especially with only 3 weak hearts.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, if West chooses to double then 4@S seems quite aggressive. East did pass 4@D meaning East can't have too much. Therefore, it is probably best to defend 4@D which does make.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BWest^*n: The problem is that I see a preempt on my left and a dbl by partner so I think we have most of the points.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well partner didn't bid over 4@D. So something strange is going on which is why I think 3@S is a better choice than double. That way partner has enough information to make an intelligent decision.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BWest^*n: I agree -- but was East strong enough to X over 2@D?|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


at|^b@2^z@3^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is close. I like pass but like double more. Suppose East passes and I raise to 3@D and you pass. Now East is going to wish he bid which is why bidding immediately rather than "waiting to see what develops" as some people do is a better choice on most hands.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, 3N makes. In general I strain to bid 3N over a 2N bid in IMPs. The only time its wrong is if 2N makes exactly and 3N goes down 1. Otherwise the extra undertrick is not that important.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The gain from making a close game is worth the risk.  

So I would have bid 3N with the North hand, It is lucky we had the diamond fit. And notice the intermediate card in hearts (the 9) was key.|

I dislike 3@S because that makes it hard to get to 3N if partner has no spade stopper. 3@C is okay. But if partner bids 3@D (somewhat likely) you are still bidding 3N and making it easier for me to lead a heart. Whereas if you bid 3N right away I am probably leading a spade.|

If not then you might not want to bid 4@D and push them into 4@S. I am not saying 4@D is a bad bid in the sense that it is probably not dangerous. |

at|^b@2^z@3^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But whenever you are in a competitive auction where you have a minor and they have a major you need to think about bidding to the 4-level in your minor. You need to think about that before bidding 4@D.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@D worked out. But if I did not have the @HJ they would make 4@S. So something to consider when you compete to the 4-level in a minor. In Matchpoints it is not as important because if they make game so be it.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, you might push them up too high as what happened here. But in IMPs, the risk is often not worth the reward if they go down.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing to note about the West 3@S bid. That is NOT invitational the way most experts play. It simply says West wants to play in 3@S rather than 3@D. If West wanted to make a game try he needs to bid something else.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In particular, I would have bid 3@H with the West hand asking partner to bid 4@S with a good 2@S bid or some hearts. And with the 6 hearts I might very well bid 4@H or 4@S with the East hand which as it turns out is down 1. But had hearts behaved better it makes.|
