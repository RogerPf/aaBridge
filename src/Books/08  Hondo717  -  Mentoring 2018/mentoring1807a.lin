up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine, although, it turns out the contract was not a good one. East can only count 5 tricks off the top. 1 diamond, 2 spades, and 2 clubs. If spades are 3-3 that gives 2 more spade tricks and East can try and set up 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So a club to the 10 was fine and then East should duck a spade as she did. After winning the 2nd spade, play a 3rd spade. When that doesn't work try the @CK and hope clubs are 3-3. That will come to 8 tricks if they are. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But as it turns out, they are not 3-3 either. So East ends up taking 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs, and 1 diamond, for down 2. Not much better than she did but a little bit.|

mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, West should have a better suit to overcall. West does have 5-5 distribution, which is great. However, her hand has a very big flaw. Of her 10 HCP, more than half (6) are in her short suits. You strongly prefer that your HCP be in your long suits.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if her hand were @Sxx @HKQxxx @DKQxxx @Cx. That is vastly better than the hand she has, although it has the same number of HCP. Would I bid 2@H? maybe. I also might bid 2@S Michaels. But I wouldn't love either bid.|

I have 18 Declarer Points--2 for singleton, 1 for 4-card club suit. So we could easily have game. Unfortunately, if I bid 3@S, that is just competing and partner will never raise to 4.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One solution is to play something called a ^*BMaximal Double^*n. |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgeguys.com/doubles/MaximalDouble.html,(External LINK  -  Here)^*N|CP||FP||at|. On this auction, where the opponents bid the suit just below our suit there is no room to explore for game. If you play maximal doubles, if I double here, that is not penalty. That is just a game invitation. North can bid 4@S with a good 2@S raise, otherwise bid 3@S. So I am going to play that.|

PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Without getting into exactly how you count losers. You have 3 potential losers in each suit for a total of 12 losers in each hand, or a total of 24 losers. If you end up with 14 losers between the 2 hands that means, 
^^^c 24 - 14   =   10    winners.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A min opening bid is 7 loser hand. Therefore, a min opener opposite a min opener is 14 losers or 10 winners. On this hand, however, I made a game try with probably have a 6 loser hand. And if North has an 8 loser hand, we have only 14 losers or 10 winners. Therefore, we should be in game using Losing Trick count.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 9 losers,    2 hearts with 3 clubs for sure and 2 diamonds and 2 spade losers. That is what normally represents around 6-8 points. So North, using Losing Trick Count, should not bid 4@S. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, I still think using Bergen Hand Evaluation is the way to go. If North had 8 or 9 dummy points, he should bid game. But he only has 7 dummy points (6 HCP and a doubleton) not to mention he has only 1 king and no aces.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, a Maximal Double shows a hand that wants to be in game opposite a good 2@S raise meaning it shows around 17 points or about 6 losers. Again, Losing Trick Count is not especially accurate on many hands. So use Bergen and don't play Losing Trick Count.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to passing the double. My double was "maximal" and not a penalty. It simply asks North to bid 3@S with a min raise (6-7) or 4@ with a max raise (8-9). Responder virtually never passes a Maximal Double.|

I know many players feel you should not open a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major but I completely disagree.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of the time you want to play in your 6-card suit. Therefore, don't let the outside 4-card major dissuade you from opening a weak 2. However, I am pretty weak here. I only have 3 HCP (the @DJ is really worthless).|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I am 6-4 which is great distribution. Further, I am at favorable vulnerability (not vul against vul opponents). Favorable vul is the best time to preempt. 
^^In fact the experts have an expression ^*b WARIB ^*n   White Against Red Isn't Bridge.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It means is if you are white (which is a nickname for being not vul) and the opponents are red (a nickname for vul) you should be very aggressive and not worry about bridge principles. So, with this hand, in 1st seat or 3rd seat, I would preempt at favorable but not in 2nd seat because in 2nd seat, you are more likely to preempt partner.|

It conveys, "Partner I have at least a reasonably good hand. The hand belongs to us. I am not sure what to do. So I am doubling and you need to "do something intelligent."|

up|30|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although many would be afraid to bid with the North hand they should love their 8 card suit even though it is weak. Let's assume the remaining clubs are evenly distributed among the other 3 hands meaning North has a 9 or 10 card club fit. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if that is the case even if partner has 0 HCP the North hand is worth 6 tricks. There are many hands (including some that are a strong NT) that could not take 6 tricks opposite a 0 HCP hand. The point is even with 1 HCP, a hand with an 8 card suit has good trick taking potential. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Keep that in mind distribution is often more important than HCP. At favorable vul I might try 5@C but I think with the North hand I would only bid 3@C.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On another point, should West bid 6@S over 5@S? |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


at|It's not a good contract which happen to make. However, I would strongly consider bidding 6 because of the club void. West has 21 Declarer Points. They are 13 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point, 4 for club void, and 1 for the side 4+ card diamond suit.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West can assume East has an opener at least and will often have 4 spades. So I think a 6@S bid by West would be reasonable. It turns out it makes against any lead because the heart finesse works and hearts are 2-2. And even if were that not the case if spades were 3-2 and the spade finesse worked.|

MB|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|lb|*yShould South bid 4S now?^^y|mb|4s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's assume there were no interference hypothetically and North made a limit raise with her hand with West passing. I absolutely should bid 4@S. A good rule of thumb to use if partner makes a 4-card limit raise, regardless of how strong your hand is and you have a singleton you should always bid game. |

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let us atop the "what ifs" and go back to 5@D by West.|

mb|5d|mb|?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|lb|*bNow what should South do here?^^x|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5 over 5 decisions are very difficult in Match Points especially when you are vul and they are not. However, there is a saying that, "The 5 level belongs to the opponents" meaning you should be reluctant to bid "5 over 5."|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, my singleton diamond is nice but partner is a passed hand, I only have 12 HCP, and I know partner only has at most 11 or 12 HCP. So it is unlikely we can make 5@S. In this case. Therefore, I think double is pretty clear. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner were not a passed hand, the decision would be more difficult as partner's 3@D bid would have shown a limit raise "OR BETTER."|mb|D|

However, partner already knows, based on the play and the bidding how many spades I have so an expert defender's spade back would be a suit preference.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I lead back my highest remaining spade (the @S9) that means I like the higher remaining suit (hearts). If I lead back my lowest remaining spade (the @S4) that means I like the lower remaining suit (clubs). And if I lead back a middle spade (the @S7) it means I have no preference.|pc|S9|

up|28|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the bidding. We probably can we make 4@S. We have no heart losers, no spade losers, and only 1 diamond loser. Further, it turns out, I can set up an end play and lose at most 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A reasonable way to play clubs is to lead a low club towards the @C10 in which case I lose at most 2 clubs. The only way to lose 3 clubs is to play a club to the @CA and a club back. And even then I guess I only lose 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@S always makes but 5@S does not. 5@D doubled is what is called the "par result" meaning it is the best both sides can do assuming perfect bidding and play.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2A Kib: The GIB says it makes 5 spades, is it not reliable?|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can make 5@S if you know the exact club situation, play a low club to the 8, but thats not the best way to play the suit. Beware of double dummy analyzers. After a hand you have to take the GIB results with a grain of salt because they see all hands same with the results sheets you get from a tournament or club game.|

mb|2H|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North can bid 2@H, as the double is not penalty again but with zero HCP and a flat hand a pass is more judicious.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We broke even in IMPs as they make a diamond partial taking 5 diamond tricks, 2 heart tricks a spade and 1 club at least--9 or 10 tricks. Had West passed, we do end up in 2@S. So it turns out it doesn't matter what West does.|
