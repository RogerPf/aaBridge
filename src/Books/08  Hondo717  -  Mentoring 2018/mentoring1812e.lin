Sometimes you have to jump shift into a 3-card suit. The other choice is to bid 4@H. But you really want to have a 1 loser suit opposite a small singleton to do that and my hearts are not quite strong enough.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All considered, I think 4@H is slightly more descriptive though it could end up being wrong. If you chose 3@D I wouldn't hate the bid.|mb|4H|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth:^*N So I pass.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes you should pass. But please note that 4@H is NOT a shutout bid. It shows a 20+ point hand with very nice hearts. If responder has an appropriate hand they should think about 6.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if North had another heart, particularly honor doubleton, and the 2 aces then 6 should be considered.|mb|P|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sk|s|
pc|DT|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to sure tricks, I have 3 diamonds, 1 club, and probably at least 4 hearts. That's 8 tricks and I need 2 more. If diamonds break I might get another trick. I might get a 5th heart trick, or even 6 on a really good day and I might get a spade trick. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So what I am going to do is win in my hand, lead a club to the ace, and lead a spade. If East plays low, I am going to play the @SJ because most Easts would take the @SA if they had it. And if West wins the spade and leads a heart, that helps me.|

UP|37|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again, planning the hand helped a lot. You should always count your winners and figure out a plan to generate enough winners to make your contract. It was not 100% obvious how to play both this hand or the last hand. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you make a plan you will be way ahead of the game. Don't just look at 1 or 2 suits. Look at all 4 suits and come up with a master plan. BTW, with my heart holding it was at least 50% that I would take 5 heart tricks. With a 7 card fit missing the queen the odds that the queen will come down in 2 or 3 rounds is 50%. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good percentage to keep in mind. So if I played the @HA, @HK, and a low heart I would expect to take 5 heart tricks 50% of the time.|

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East could have bid 1@D. But, particularly since partner passed and East has a 7-card suit with 4 honors and 2 singletons I think 4@D is the stand out bid.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen says any suit with 4 honors can be considered 1 longer than it actually is. So you could treat your diamonds as an 8 card suit. But even without the @D10 I would still bid 4@D.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to my options, I can obviously bid a suit. If I double, that is NOT penalty and it is NOT negative exactly. It's a "value showing" or "do something intelligent" double. I am saying, "partner I have some values", use your best judgment as to what to do. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Often partner will pass. But sometimes partner will bid. For example with a singleton diamond and a 4-card major, partner might bid the major.|mb|D|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with North's pass. As North, I would pass too. It could be we can make 4@S or 5@C. But with a doubleton diamond and no major I would pass. That doesn't mean we are beating the hand. That would be my choice as the least of evils. That's why you preempt to make it hard for the opponents to make their best decision.|mb|p|

UP|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East was very lucky to make 4@D. But good players make their own luck. Had I not convinced East to bid 4@D she would not have had as good a result. The 4@D bid put a lot of pressure on me and I chose to make a decision, doubling, that did not work out. I probably had a minimal hand for a double. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, it turns out we are down 1 in 4@S even with the 4-1 break. So the best result is to let them play 4@D undoubled. Anyway the preempt caused us to make the wrong decision which is why you should aggressively preempt.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bWhat call would you make as North?^^P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would pass with the North hand although 5@H is possible. We do have a 10 or 11 card heart fit. But other than hearts and some dubious diamonds North has no tricks.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


sb|s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So perhaps we can make 8 heart tricks if I have 8, a spade, and maybe a diamond. But it is unlikely we can take more than that. So given the vulnerability and the long spades I think pass is best hoping to beat 4@S.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, I would not double with the North hand because it is not clear at all, despite the bad trump break, we can beat 4@S particularly since North has 3 hearts meaning it is very likely we take 1 heart trick at most and possibly none.|mb|?|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could but you might be setting 5@H. Further, a good general principle is "the 5 level belongs to the opponents." What that means is you should be very careful about bidding "5 over 5." You only do so when it is pretty clear.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest^*n: How about a double by East?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is an interesting call. In Matchpoints I like it a lot but I am not sure in IMPs. East should assume West has a fair number of points probably, at least 2 tricks and East has 2 aces. Also double would be a good bid after, and if, North bids 5@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had North supported hearts his correct lead would be the 9. But since he did not support hearts he leads low. The reason is that count is usually more important than attitude in a suit. |

pc|DT|pc|DQ|pc|D2|pc|D9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @D10 was incorrect. In general you should avoid leading an honor. Note that if East had played low towards the @DKJ he would lose only 2 diamonds rather than 3. This is an important principle. I didn't give him an undo because I wanted to illustrate it. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although sometimes you lead an honor from your hand when taking a finesse. However, you should avoid doing so if you can because say I cover the honor then you are playing 2 honors of yours to take care of 1 for the defense. Whereas if you lead low, you are only using one of your honors.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This diamond position was a good illustration of why that can be important. Normally I would have given you the undo, But I didn't want to pass up this teaching moment.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me talk about my double. You might think it was lead directing as doubles of artificial bids are usually lead directing. However, in this case it was not. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a sacrifice suggestion because it is likely they are ending up in 4@H and I am going to be on lead. So there would be no point in my making a lead directing double.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, it would not be unreasonable for me to bid 5@C on this auction.|

Had East not bid, that would be a normal 6-10. But once East bids, I am no longer obligated to bid with a very weak hand. So 1NT after an overcall shows 8-10 or a good 7 at least.|mb|1N|

pc|HT|pc|HA|pc|H3|pc|H5|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a lot of work to do. I only have 4 top tricks, 1 heart, 2 spades, and 1 diamond. I can set up one additional trick in spades and will probably get a 2nd heart trick since East should hold the @HKQ which, by the way, is why I played the ace on the first trick.|

PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest^*n: Does it matter for you telling your partner you have the ace?|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


pc|CK|cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. It matters. Your partner doesn't know you have the @CK if you play the @CA. On this hand since you are intending to play both the @CA and @CK you are right, it doesn't matter. But you should still get in the habit of correct carding.|
