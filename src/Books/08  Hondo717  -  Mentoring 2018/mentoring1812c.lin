up|29|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main question is how the hand should be played. Assuming clubs behave, declarer has 5 clubs, 2 spades and 1 heart for sure. So declarer needs one extra trick. She knows that hearts are breaking 6-2 after the 3rd heart trick. So if possible, East must be kept off the lead.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also it was reasonable for declarer to hope West had the @DA. If that were the case, declarer can set up a 9th trick in diamonds. Another chance was if East had the @SQ. In that case declarer can take 3 spade tricks. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And even if the spade finesse loses, declarer can still hope that West has the @DA. It's a matter of giving yourself two 50% chances instead of one.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And finally let's talk about the heart lead. It was correct if you play standard leads. You lead 10 from K109. But some people play coded tens and nines. If you play that the lead of the 9 shows either the 10 and a higher honor (not the J) or nothing higher than the 9.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand playing coded 9s doesn't really matter as it turns out since, once the @HQ wins, it is pretty clear that East holds the K109. But on other hands, coded tens and nines give partner more information about opening leader's holding.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the nicest of the fairly common distributions because it allows the possibility of a fit in 3 suits. However the hand several flaws. The singleton spade king is a flaw. The fact that you have no honors in your longest suit is another flaw.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would still would open it, but I would not object if someone decided to downgrade the hand and not open in 1st seat. Of course, it has another concern which we soon will note.|

mb|P|mb|1S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|MB|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East cannot bid 2@D (another flaw in opening 1@C). That is a reverse showing 16+ points. The best choice is 1N. For this particular concern, some would choose to open 1@D with the East hand and rebid 2@C.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is time to talk about opening 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. Many people do that to avoid the rebid problem that we just saw East had. I am not one of those people because suppose East opens 1@D and rebids 2@C with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, how is poor partner supposed to know what to do.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose partner has an equal number of clubs and diamonds. Does partner have 5 diamonds and 4 clubs or 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. Partner has no idea. That is why I don't open 1@D and rebid 2@C with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What I do is what East decided to do. I will occasionally rebid 1NT with a singleton spade. Yes, in theory it guarantees 2 spades at least, which I do not have, but it is the best way to describe an imperfect hand.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to make. But let's discuss a slightly different line of play. After the diamond lead, East knows I have the @DQ. So, East can maneuver 4 diamond tricks by finessing again against my @DQ. Next, East can take 4 heart tricks. That's 8 tricks. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So here is what I would do at trick 2. I would lead a spade, hoping North had the @SA and would duck and then my @SK would be the 9th trick. That play would work most of the time since, unless North peeked, there would normally be no reason to play the @SA. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perhaps, on this hand with @SAQ they might play the @SA. But in general they would play 2nd hand low. That is the best way to try and make the contract.|

^*bPuppet Stayman^*N^*g:puppetstayman::After Opening 1NT,   (LINK  -  Puppet Stayman)^*n. That would make my hand harder to bid. |

PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me briefly explain about Puppet Stayman. Puppet Stayman, which is a reasonable convention over 2N in particular allows you to discover if partner has either a 4-card major or a 5-card major. The way it works I would bid 3@C. Partner bids 3@H or 3@S with a 5-card suit. With one or two 4-card majors partner bids 3@D. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And finally, with no 4-card major partner bids 3NT. So on this hand, if I chose to bid 3@C and we were playing Puppet Stayman partner would bid 3N (no 4 or 5 card major) and I would not be able to find out if we had a 5-3 spade fit). |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I chose to transfer to spades by bidding 3@H then we would miss a 4-4 heart fit. So I have to make a choice. But playing regular Stayman I can bid 3@C and over 3@D bid 3@S. Then partner knows I have 4 hearts and 5 spades and can place the contract. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly, if I bid 3@H over 3@D that shows 5 hearts and 4 spades. So although Puppet Stayman is preferred by a majority of better players, it does have some flaws. Personally, I have no preference about whether or not to play it.|

pc|C3|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets discuss how to play the hand. Declarer has 2 spade tricks, 3 heart tricks, 1 club trick, and 1 diamond trick as of now. That is 7 tricks. He can easily generate 3 diamond tricks by losing the @DK which would give him 9 tricks. And given his club holding he can only lose at most 2 more club tricks. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So that would be at most 4 losing tricks (3 clubs and a diamond). Therefore the right way to play the hand (which happens to work better than expected) is to throw a spade (in case hearts are 3-3, what the heck). Finally, play the @DA and then @DQ to knock out the @DK. That guarantees 3NT and on this hand. It really luckily works extra well.|

mb|P|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a reasonable 2@C opener, but let me discuss the downside. Whenever you open 2@C when diamonds is your suit, you are going to have a problem auction. It is going to start 2@C-2@D-3@D which has some severe downsides. One is you have "self-preempted" in that you are at 3@D before you make your first natural bid. So you are quite high.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd is, the contract is probably being played from the wrong side if you end up in diamonds. So, you should be reluctant to open 2@C when your suit is diamonds. Although with the North hand it is reasonable. I might consider opening 1@D even with such a nice hand. But a hand with 6 quick tricks is so rare that I think 2@C is best.|

^*g:kickback::Slam Bidding,(LINK  -  Kickback)^*n  on this hand. The way it works is, 1 suit higher than the trump suit is how you bid Roman Key Card. So 4NT is RKCB for spades, 4@S is RKCB for hearts, 4@H is RKCB for diamonds, and 4@D is RKCB for clubs. |

PG| ***** 94 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Besides the simplicity of having South bid a Kickback 4@H, there are other issues if I had South bid 4@D. Now it is not clear if 4@H is RKCB (although it could be). It might be or it might be a control bid in hearts, depending on your agreement.     I did not want to get into that discussion as I wanted to focus on how Kickback and the Queen ask works. That is why I chose to bid the hand the way I did.   The jump to 4@H over 3@D is clearly Kickback.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But to answer your question, this is the auction bidding that way, assuming 4@H is Kickback RKCB. Note it also makes use of the Queen ask.|ub|12|

PG| ***** 104 ***** |


at|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should be eager to overcall at the 1-level. You need only a good 8 points and a 5-card suit. Your suit does not have to be particularly robust, although, since partner is going to lead it, there is some risk that partner will make a less than optimal lead when you overcall with a weakish suit. Having said that, it is better to compete, particularly when you have spades.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The requirements for an overcall at the 2-level are a bit more stringent. You should have at least 10 points. More importantly, you should have a good suit. Any 6+ card suit is fine. If you have a 5-card suit, it should be fairly robust, hopefully with 2 of the top 3 or 3 of the top 5 honors. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It can be a little weaker if the suit contains some intermediates or you have 12+ points. On this deal, South has a fairly minimum 2@D overcall. Some players might pass but for me the overcall is reasonable and is what I would do.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hand that requires what is known as "active defense." Many times you play passive defense meaning you defend in a way so as not to give anything away as declarer. But on this hand I have these long clubs staring me in the face. So I know declarer is going to get lots of discards. Therefore, we better take our outside tricks ASAP.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have to hope partner has the @HA. Otherwise I doubt we are beating the hand. This is active defense. Alas it is not to be.|

And with a singleton you should be very reluctant to go any higher than you already are. So I would definitely pass with the North hand.|mb|p|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a few cases where we might be able to make a spade or club contract but it is not worth the risk. A preempt is generally an all or nothing bid. It tends to set trump.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


mb|x|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Usually you would only reopen with a double to protect in case partner has a penalty double of hearts which would imply the doubler should be short in hearts. So with the East hand, I would pass since he has AJx of hearts, not great on offense given North is known to be short in hearts (did not raise).|
