PG| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, stopping in 2N is one of my least favorite actions. In IMPs in particular it is only right if your side can make exactly 2N. If you go down an extra in 3N it is not that big a deal. But if you make 3N you have lost a good opportunity. Here pass is fine and technically correct as I said.|mb|P|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to demonstrate how to make a "coded 9" lead which is what many experts play. The lead of the 9, which is what I am going to do in spades shows either a broken sequence headed by the 10 (A109, K109, or Q109) usually or occasionally nothing higher than the 9.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BNorth^*n: Is there also coded 10?|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Similar idea. The 10 shows AJ10 or KJ10 usually or nothing higher than the 10, Some say "0 or 2" higher  and although that is not technically correct it is accurate but incomplete explanation. The reason to play coded 10 is that if partner leads the Jack you know for a fact that partner has nothing higher.|pc|S9|

PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general you want your honors in your long suits and you don't like wasted honors in short suits. Even a singleton ace, which technically is not wasted is not nearly as good as an ace in a long suit.|

East should bid at least 2 hearts. I might even bid 3. Again hands with long suits (7 cards) and a singleton are wonderful. East can't worry about telling me where the points are. His objective is to disrupt our auction.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We are getting to game. Therefore, East should try and get us to bid the wrong game or miss a slam. If East bids 3@H we could easily miss 6@C. However, we let the pass stand.|

PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However there is one caveat. You never make a short suit control bid in a suit partner has bid. 

You only show honors. So despite the fact that I have 2nd round control in diamonds (e.g. a singleton) I should not control bid 4@D.|

I strongly prefer 0314 to 1430 in general although most play 1430. 

HOWEVER, even if you play 1430, you MUST play 0314 when clubs is trump. Supposed I had 0 key cards which is unlikely but possible. |

If you have to lead the suit, you are likely to lose 3 tricks. The only way you are not going to lose 3 tricks is if a) one person holds the AK or b) you guess which person has a doubleton honor. Both of those are low percentage.|

I don't like that approach personally because it sometimes wrong sides the contract when opener has hearts.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I prefer what is called the "2nd negative" approach. If partner opens 2@C and I have a weak hand, I start with 2@D. 

If partner bids 2@H or 2@S, 3@C by me is an artificial bid showing no aces or kings and not great support. 
Because with support I would jump to 4 as "fast arrival" showing a weak hand with support (no aces or kings) and if partner bids 2N I know what to do.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner rebids 3@C or 3@D, then we might have a problem. But that happens so rarely it is not worth worrying about because opening 2@C and rebidding 3 of a minor is a problem auction in any case.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even though East-West have 23-25 points, playing a hand where one person has all the points and the other person has very few is difficult. It is much more difficult than playing a hand where the points are even between the 2 hands because it is difficult to get to dummy to take any finesses.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|pc|H4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now partner needs to carefully watch the heart I return because I return "remaining count." If I lead a high heart, I have 2 remaining (originally started with 3).|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I lead a low heart, as I am going to do here, I started with 4 hearts (or rarely 2). And if I started with 4 hearts, North should be able to figure out that West started with 3 hearts. I started with 4, North started with 4, dummy started with 2. So that leaves 3 for West.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This sort of carding and counting is crucial if you want to improve your defense. Defense is extremely difficult. So you should make every effort to make it as easy as possible for you and your partner by counting and carding correctly.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember you are going to be defending half the time especially if you play against me, because I hate to defend so I bid a lot.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|pc|CK|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ducking here is crucial and again, North and South need to cooperate. South needs to give count in clubs so North can figure out how many times to duck he club. If I show a doubleton by playing high low then North knows West started with 3 clubs.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North had 4 clubs, dummy had 4 clubs, I had 2 clubs. That leaves West with 3 and therefore North needs to duck twice.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I play low, showing 3 (on a different hand), then North only needs to duck once. On this hand North should duck twice to avoid giving up any extra clubs.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, well played by both sides. You show an even number of cards by playing high low an odd number of cards by playing low high. So if I lead a high card to show remaining count that is a high low, showing 2 (an even number).|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I lead a low card that shows an odd number remaining (low). This hand had good illustration of how to count and card as defenders. I suggest you study it when it comes out in a future movie.|

But it is becoming more common these days. Marty Bergen says that a suit with 4 honors can be treated as being one longer than it actually is. I don't totally agree with that as I think there is a big difference between a 5-card suit and a 4-card suit but I understand what he is saying.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And should North end up on lead I would certainly want a heart lead. So bidding 1@H would not be a bad idea here although we might get to the 3-level in a 4-3 fit which wouldn't make me happy.|mb|1H|

   a)  you want to defend against 4@S or 
   b)  you want to suggest a 5@C sacrifice to partner.|

pg| ***** 145 ***** |


mb|Pp?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Its not clear whether North should double. In fact 5@S might be right. But at this vul and the maxim "the 5 level belongs to the opponents" I would not bid 5@S. "5 over 5" decisions are the most difficult in bridge.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would double in Match Points figuring if they make 5 clubs they are getting a great board anyway. I am not sure 5@S is as clear in IMPs.|

up|41|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out we can make 4@S and 5@C should be down 1. A a rare hand where a vul sacrifice worked out had the hand been declared slightly differently. And even here since we didn't double it worked out fine.|
