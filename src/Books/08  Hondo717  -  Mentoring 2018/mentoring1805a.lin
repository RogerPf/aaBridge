up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C was best bid. On the other hand, with the West hand, I think 3@C is a better bid than 2N. With 6 very nice clubs and 5 mediocre diamonds I think West would want to play in clubs. Clubs is a reasonable trump suit even if pard has a singleton.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don't be afraid to play in a quality 6-card suit as trump. BTW, I think 2N could be down 2. It is rarely a good idea to play in NT when partner shows 2 suits. If we defend perfectly we can take 5 spades and 2 diamonds.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out, if East takes the first heart, which he should assuming I have the KQ10, then he has 2 heart stoppers. But even if I don't have the 10 he still has 2 heart stoppers as it turns out because the suit blocks.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if he is in 3NT, it might make. I also probably should lead a low heart and not the King because I lack the J or 10 in which case 3N always makes.|

patcanuck: Howard, why a 1NT rebid shows 18-19?|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. Because  
^c@2a) with 15-17 East would have opened 1N and 
b) since @2partner passed he is weakish and bidding 1N with less than 18 or so is very dangerous. East certainly should not bid 1N with 12-14.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So since he can't have either 12-14 or 15-17 he must have 18 or 19 or perhaps 20.|

mb|?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What you should do when you have a distributional hand is what I call "picture" bidding rather than simply counting points. Using Bergen hand evaluation is good, but with distributional hands even it is not perfect.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So here is what I am picturing. If partner has as little as the @SK and a red ace we can be in slam. Hopefully you can picture that. I have no way of finding that out for sure. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But what I can do is make a splinter bid of 4@H encouraging partner to look for slam. Of course partner, with such a weak hand has no interest in slam whatsoever. But with a better hand she would.|mb|4H|

up|29|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The line of play was okay. Although I simply lead a diamond at trick 2 rather than a heart. Basically once you get to your hand you can take the spade finesse.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs to avoid a diamond ruff, an alternative was to play the @SA and another spade. That makes 4 when you might be able to make 5.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just for fun, although I encourage picture bidding. let me evaluate my hand using Bergen hand evaluation. Here, although I will end up as dummy, this is a rare case where I should count Bergen ^*B"Declarer"^*n points rather than Bergen ^*B"Dummy"^*n points.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because the person with the longer trump counts ^*B"Declarer"^*n points, whether or not he actually ends up as declarer. ^*B"Declarer"^*n actually means points for person who has the longer trump length.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of the time, whoever bids the suit first ends up having the longer suit. But in some instances, the most notable being when there is an opening bid of 1NT and responder transfers. Then the person who ends up as dummy has the longer trump.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my Declarer Points. I have 15 HCP, 3 length points,2 points for each singleton, and 1 point for the 4+ card side diamond suit for 23 Declarer Points. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Clearly we can make 4@S and partner only needs 10 in theory to make slam. However, with my picture bidding discussion with the right 7, (the @SK and a red ace), it also makes slam.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
kirby2: What is the advantage in opening 1@D even though you have 5 spades?|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


at|^b@2^z@3^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I opened 1@D because in general with 5-6, where the 6 card suit is below the 5-card suit, you should open 1 in the 6-card suit. |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only exception is when you might have to reverse such as when you have diamonds and hearts and partner is likely to bid 1@S over 1@D and you have to bid 2@H. |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even then, with as little as 12 HCP with 6-5, you still should open 1@D and plan to reverse into @h's because although you have only 12 HCP, your hand is worth a lot more because of the great distribution. |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, distribution is very underrated by most players. But it often makes more difference than the HCP.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I did miss that West should not open 1N with 5-4 in the majors. In general I don't open 1NT with 5-4-2-2 distribution. I have recently made one exception. |
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When I have 15-17, 4 hearts, a 5-card minor, and am 2-2 in spades and the other minor I will sometimes open 1NT if I don't feel I am strong enough to open 1 in my minor and reverse to 2@H.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But that is the only exception with 4 hearts and a 5-card minor. You can sometimes lose a 4-4 heart fit. If partner responds 1@S over 1 of your minor.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why I might open 1N if I can't reverse to 2@H. But generally speaking, although many players these days open 1NT with lots of off shape hands I still believe that one of the strengths of 1NT is its precise definition.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I only open 1NT with  5332 4432  and  4333 except in the one case I discussed where it is otherwise hard to bid the hand.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Exactly. Not when you have enough points for game. And with your nice hearts we could have a heart fit.|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My choice would be 3@H intending to bid 3N over 3@S. And if I bid something else, North still will be fine.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2KIB: Don't you need a stopper in the other suits to bid NT game?|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, North only needs a stopper in diamonds. In this case, he can and should bid 3@H forcing. And if I bid 3@S, then he can bid 3N. If I bid 4@C or 4@H he is happy as well.|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


mb|3H|mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is what Bergen calls "the most flexible call." It allows your side the best chance to find the correct contract. Of course I am going to throw North a curve here. He needs to pass unless he wants to bid 6 which he doesn't.|mb|4S|

pc|D9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count winners. I have 6 spades (assuming a 3-2 break), 2 hearts, and 1 diamond. I need one more trick. I can hope that East has the @CA so my @CK is good or I can hope West has the @HQ in which case I have a 3rd heart trick.|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|From the opening lead I know East started with the KQJ of diamonds. There is barely room in the East hand for the @CA. But it is pretty unlikely especially if East has a spade honor. Because then East probably would have opened 1@D not 2@D.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So my best shot which doesn't work here is to play West for the @HQ and hope East either started with 2 spades or 3 hearts in which case I have 10 tricks. That is what I am going to do and go down several extra tricks as it turns out.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Defense is very hard and you really need to do the following:
^Ca) card correctly;
^Cb) count out suits;
^Cc) signal partner high when you want him or her to lead a suit.|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand both players were guilty of not doing (c) although given dummy's holding East was leading a club anyway. But it never hurts to help partner defend correctly.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As the declarer, I gave it what I thought was the best chance given the auction. And since I can't make anyway in IMPs the extra -100 is almost irrelevant.|
