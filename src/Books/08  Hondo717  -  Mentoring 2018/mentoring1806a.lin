nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, since West made no bid (might double with some values) my partner rates to have something and he doesn't know my 4@S includes defense. So I think double is best.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play ^*BDOPI^*N ("double with 0, pass with 1") or ^*BDEPO^*N ("double with even, pass with odd").|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play pass saying I have a bid lower than what the opponent bid (e.g. I would have bid 5@C). It says the opponent "stole" my bid if I double (e.g I would have bid 5@D). And 5@H and 5@S retain their same meaning. I think that's the easiest way to play. It's pretty straight forward.|

Therfore North knows we have game but not slam. Note that if I bid 3@S that shows 17-19 Dummy Points and partner bids 4 with 8+. With 16+ partner possibly could bid slam. |

up|37|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. Declarer should plan the hand out at trick one. Declarer should always count the winners. If spades are 3-2 the hand is straight forward because you can win 4 spades in dummy and ruff a club in your hand for the 5th spade. |
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you ruff something in the short hand or if when both hands start with the same number of trump you get an extra trick. But if you ruff in the long hand (say spades were 5-3 and you ruffed in the hand with 5 spades) that does not generate an extra winner.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other minor point about the diamonds. Almost always there will be 1 diamond loser but there is a small chance there are no diamond losers if West has a singleton @DQ or @DJ. |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The expert way to play the suit is to cash the @DA first in the North hand. If the @DQ or @DJ appears in the West hand then finesse the @D10 at the 2nd diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:  ^*N|cp||at|You may be wondering why not play West for the doubleton @dQJ.

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In short that means, when missing the Q or J, if someone voluntarily plays one of those cards on the first trick the odds are 2-1 that it is a singleton and not part of a doubleton QJ.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The math is tricky. So just remember the principle. The finesse is basically 67% when that happens, not the usual 50%. For more please click the blue link in the previous panel.|
