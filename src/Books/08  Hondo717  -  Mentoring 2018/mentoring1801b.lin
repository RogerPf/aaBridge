mb|1S|mb|2N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A tad aggressive. Let's discuss a (somewhat complicated) defense to unusual NT called "unusual over unusual." It applies whenever someone makes a 5-5 suited bid where both suits are known. It works as follows:|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double suggests a penalty. If you cue bid one of the opponents suit, the lower cue bid suggests strength in the lower suit not held by the opponent. So in this case, 3@C by me suggests a good hand with hearts (our lower suit). The higher cue bid suggests strength in the higher ranking suit (so 3@D by me suggests spades).|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular auction 3@C would show a good hand with hearts, 3@D would show a limit+ raise in spades, and 3@H would just be competing, as would 3@S. I am going to choose 3@C (showing a good hand with hearts). I could bid 3@D but I prefer to have 4-card support or at least 3 good spades because a 4-1 break is more likely.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, some people play that 2N promises either a very weak hand (less than an opener, no more than 10 or so) or a strong hand (15+). With 11-14 they just overcall. I am not a big fan of that.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice 5@C bid by North. If I had a 6th heart I probably go to 6. Note the importance of the intermediate spots on this hand. The @D10 set up 4 diamond tricks for me because I had AQJ98.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And look at the spades. If need be I can play the spades for no losers because West has both the Q and 10. I can lead the J, when West covers I win the @SA. Get back to my hand and lead a low spade and finesse West's @S10. So the @S9 could have played an important role.|

Then he might make it--do it when double dummy is on. The important point on this hand was the bidding. With forcing 1NT auctions you often end up in 5-2 at 2-level major suit contracts.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best we can do is hold it to 1NT. Let me talk about how North can figure out what West might have. Whenever an opponent opens 1NT, 2NT, or rebids 1NT or 2NT his point range is known within 3 points (e.g. 15-17, 12-14, etc.). |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand North knows West is 15-17. North has 15 and dummy has 7 for a total of 22. That's 37. It means South has at most 3, and could have as little as 1 point. I could have had the @CK or the @CQJ. It is hard to know.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out, had North decided that, after cashing the last diamond, with 4 cards remaining that West had 2 hearts and 2 clubs including the @CK a heart would be better.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Defense is very hard. But if you train yourself to count declarer's distribution and high cards and can picture what is going on (which is not all that easy), defense can be made easier. Most people don't make the effort to count. Personally, I find good defense to be very rewarding.|
