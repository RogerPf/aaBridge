nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However it turns out 5@C is down 2 losing 2 diamonds, 1 heart and 1 spade. So its not a good sacrifice. But depending on what I have it could be. And 2N lets partner decide whether or not to sac. Also interferes with the opponents. So even at unfavorable vul, with distributional hands you should bid.|

PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well with only 4 clubs there is no issue.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 5-5 in the blacks, there are 2 different styles of opening. The old fashioned players open 1@C, intending to rebid spades twice to show 5-5. The modern players open 1@S, because the theory is to emphasize your majors especially since a lot of preempting is likely when you are 5-5.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So unless you have an explicit agreement to open 1@C with 5-5 in the black suits, the standard opening is 1@S.|

mb|P|mb|3Hp|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is not good news from my perspective. It diminishes the value of my @HK. North's best response from my perspective would have been 3@C, showing club shortness. That would have meant we have no wasted club points and slam would have been very likely if we had enough key cards.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The correct bid by North is 3@H. I am just explaining if North had been able to show club shortness from my perspective slam would have been likely. But since North correctly bid 3@H that makes slam much less likely.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever someone splinters, you devalue shortness and honors other than the ace in the splinter suit and you love it when you have either only 3 or 4 small in suit or 3 or 4 to the ace because then you can ruff several times to generate extra tricks.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Plus your honors in the other suits fit well with partner. That is why splinters are such nice bids. They let you get to slam with much fewer HCP. But now the 3@H bid by partner does not help at all and will bid 4@S showing little interest in slam.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


mb|4S|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North had a strong hand (18+) he could go on. So 4@S is not strictly a close out but it is discouraging.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2joseye: Why did you bid 2NT and not 3NT Howard?|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because 2NT is Jacoby 2NT showing 4+ spades and a game forcing hand. 3NT does not mean that.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play Bergen Raises 3NT is a little known bid over 1 of a major. It shows 13-15 points, 4-card support, and exactly 4-3-3-3 distribution. It rarely comes up. So if you chose to bid 2N with that hand, no big deal.|

pc|D9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading away from a king is not a good idea nor is leading an unprotected ace particularly when you know North is short. My choice is a spade although a diamond is reasonable as well.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, this is a rare case where if East wanted to, she could play the @HA knowing that North probably has a singleton. Of course if North has a void, (possible but not likely) then that sets up a heart trick.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the danger side, I only have 3 losers. But I have to worry about is a ruff. From the opening lead, I suspect the @DK is offsides. Is it possible that East has a singleton diamond? Not likely. That would mean diamonds are 6-1 which is possible but unlikely.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs I would play the @DA just to make sure. In Match Points it is less clear. I suspect very strong from the @D9 that the @DK is off side. So the question is, is it more likely that diamonds are 6-1 or the @DK is onside.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think neither is very likely. Therefore, in Match Points I would take the diamond finesse just in case and risk the contract. In IMPs I would not.|pc|DA|

mb|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|lb|*bBid for South.^^1d|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days the distributions where some open 1NT are more flexible. Some would open 1NT with my hand. But I still believe that you should only open 1NT when your hand contains at most 1 doubleton e.g. 5-3-3-2 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 distribution.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Otherwise you start to lose the precision of opening 1NT. And on this hand if partner is 5-5 in the majors we will end up in a 5-2 fit. Because partner with 5-5 in the majors will give me a choice of hearts or spades, assuming I have 3 card support at least in one of them.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2joseye: Have been told that we can open with a single A  or K also.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The ACBL has made it legal to open 1NT with a singleton ace or king but I still don't believe you should do that.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner assumes you have at least a doubleton in every suit. So you could easily end up in a 6-1 or even a 5-1 fit. Just because it is legal doesn't mean you should do it.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


mb|1D|mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is fine with West. But 2 other possible bids are double and 1@H. However, both are flawed. Normally with 5-4 in the majors I would bid my 5-card major rather than double.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, with 5 weak hearts and 4 strong spades I would double. Then if partner bids clubs, so be it. And I hope partner has 5.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, over 1 of a minor it is okay to double with a doubleton in the unbid minor because partner will strain to bid a major. So I would have doubled with the West hand although pass is fine.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


mb|1N|nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2Kib: Why 1N instead of 2@D Inverted Minor?|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 1N is the correct bid with the hand. North is too weak to bid 2@D and doesn't have enough diamonds to bid 3@D. the 1N bid also gives North the ability to bid 3@C (or 3@D) with a max 1N bid and then I might bid 3N.|

mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|lb|*bBid for South.^^2c|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 17 Starting Points--16 HCP, 1 length points, 1 quality suit point, and -1 for KQ doubleton in hearts. Many would bid 2N OR 3N and it might work. But if we don't have a spade stopper or if we only have 1 spade stopper and we can't take 9 tricks.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs I would bid 2@C because 1N by partner denies a major. Therefore partner either has clubs or diamonds since he doesn't have a major and 2 of a minor is safer.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass by West is okay. However, West might now reopen with a takeout double. And if she did, North should bid 3@D based on the LOTT since it is likely I have 5 diamonds on this auction.|

pc|H3|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 3 heart tricks, 4 diamond, tricks and 3 club tricks for sure since I luckily didn't get a spade lead. I can throw a losing spade on the 3rd heart and I need to do that first.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I can then take the diamond finesse. I will not lose any diamonds if East has the singleton or doubleton diamond king. Once I play diamonds I can then knock out the @CA. That is my plan.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember you should plan every hand at trick 1. That is important if you want to improve your declarer play. Even if you don't plan perfectly, some plan is better than no plan.|

pc|D2|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here some players might lead the @DJ to take the finesse. That is wrong. If East has the singleton king, then you unnecessarily set up the @D10. In general, when taking a finesse, if you have a choice of leading an honor or a low card, lead the low card unless you have a sequence of honors (such as QJ10).|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you lead an honor first, even if the finesse works you are using 2 honors to knock out 1 of their honors. Whereas when you lead low you are using only 1 honor.|
