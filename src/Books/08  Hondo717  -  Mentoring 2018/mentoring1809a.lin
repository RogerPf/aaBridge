nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And since we have a known fit in clubs (I must have at least 2) North can make the following declarer add ons - 2 points for the singleton and 1 or 2 points for the 7 clubs. So we are up to 18 at least.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And 18 and 15 is 33, enough for slam if we have the controls. On this hand we did not. So once I explained how the control bidding worked, and how North knew we had 2 diamond losers 5@C was a good call.|

^Ca) only 8 sure tricks;

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is often overlooked by players. In general, you should avoid opening a marginal 2@C when your suit is a minor  because after partner responds 2@D, you have to bid 3C and 3@D. So you are at the 3-level with your first natural bid. You have essentially preempted yourself.|

mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has a clear 3@H bid. When you have a marginal call you value long suits and shortness in their suit. North has both. North would like more HCP but you can't let the opponents push you around when you have a hand that wants to be on offense.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have a problem. I love my 4 hearts. My @DK is more likely than not to be well placed (although it might not be) but I know partner is short in diamonds and my hand is flat. So I will reluctantly pass 3@H. But would not be shocked if we made 4.|

up|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think North was victim of the BBO undo bug. So I played the hand out. Next, let me discuss why North needs to bid 3@H.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again "Points Schmoints" does apply on distributional hands. Although North does not have that many HCP, it has 2 very good features. A quality 6 card suit including the 9 and shortness in the opponents suit. So you have to upgrade the hand.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, if North had say a 12 count or even 13 count with a much flatter hand that is worse than the 10 count with 6 great hearts and a singleton diamond.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North's 3@H overcall is assuming that South has some values (7 or 8) because that is likely what South has. So South should only bid with at least a limit raise. Te bidding is imprecise after a preempt and that is exactly the point of why you preempt.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After a preempt,the opponents have to guess what to do based on probabilities and judgment which is much harder than actually describing their hand which is what they would be able to do if there was no preempt.|
