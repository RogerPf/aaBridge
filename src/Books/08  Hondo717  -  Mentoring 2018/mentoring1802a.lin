cp||at|I like my 5-4-3-1 distribution which is suitable for a DONT bid and the fact that I am not vulnerable. But I am a smidge weak to make a DONT bid in direct seat. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like to have at least 7 or 8 points. Change my @SJ to the @SK for example and I would bid DONT. You should be aggressive when competing over 1NT and DONT is one convention that allows you to be aggressive. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Giving the opponents free rein after they open 1NT makes it more likely you won't get a good result because it is very easy to have accurate bidding after a 1NT opener.|

pc|H8|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now North should have counted out the spades and realized that there are no spades remaining. So West is left with 3 hearts and a club. And therefore should throw the spade.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Both by counting points and my signals. I have said I have no heart honors. So North should have saved a heart and keep parity with the dummy. But discarding is very difficult and most Norths would have made the same play.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@D is correct as overcall at the 1 level and only promises 8 or so.|

mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Negative double here has a very particular meaning. It promises exactly 4 hearts and 4 spades. A 1@H or 1@S call promises 4 (not 5). And with 5-4 you could make a negative double, but I prefer bidding 5-card suits over 1@D.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would bid 2@S with the West hand since West has better spades, but 2@H is okay.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, with my flat hand, and unfavorable vul I pass. But in Match Points, letting them play in 2@H won't be a good result. So despite my flat hand, I would bid 3@D. Note that I didn't say anything about my 10 HCP. That is not the reason to bid more.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason to bid more is when you have a fit and it appears they only have an 8-card fit, my competitive guidelines say it is ok to bid "3 over 2" with an 8-card fit when they have an 8-card fit. So if my hand were not so flat, I would bid 3@D even in IMPs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|@CJ is my choice. It is never a good idea to lead an unsupported ace unless you think your trick is going away. Even when partner has supported you unless you have no better choice.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, West opened 1@C. So I would not have led a club on this auction because leading a suit they bid is not usually a good idea. Therefore, I would have led the @DA as the least of evils. As it turns out, either lead works out okay.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The modern theory is to open 1@C with 3-3 in the minors. However some people play "better minor" in which case they would open this hand 1@D. The other argument against opening 1@D is that opening 1@C gives responder slightly more flexibility (e.g. 1@D is available as a response).|

UP|40|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand worked out very well for the defense by not playing clubs. They ended up taking 3 club tricks. Also, not sure why North didn't draw trump but it doesn't matter.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, 2@H has no plays despite the fact that North and south both bid correctly. It is because both our 4-3-3-3 hands are big downgrades. Remember flat distribution is really bad and 4-3-3-3 is the worst.|

For example, although on this hand I have 1 less HCP (13) than last hand this hand is so much better its not even close. 6-4 distribution is wonderful. |
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A suit with 4 honors is terrific. Further, having all my HCP in my 2 long suits is great. Although it counts to officially only 16 Bergen points (13 HCP, 1 quality suit point, 2 length points) its probably worth 18 or 19.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to bid 3@S. That does not show 16-18. In 2/1, it says "partner we are playing in spades." My suit is no more than one loser even opposite a singleton. Please start control bidding unless you have a really weak 2/1 call.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now North has a decision. He knows we likely have a diamond loser. If he wants to try for slam 4N is best just to make sure we are not missing 2 key cards.|
