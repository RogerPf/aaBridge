pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other, which is more in favor these days, is to open 1@D when you are 4-4 and 1@C when you are 3-3. That way when you open 1@D you almost always have 4 diamonds. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only time you bid your 3 diamonds is when your distribution is exactly 4 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 2 clubs. And some people play a short club, meaning they open 1@C with the 4-4-3-2 hand.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is okay, but responder should still pass with less than 6 points, even if short in clubs. I prefer not playing short club, but I don't hate it so long as responder doesn't freak out when short in clubs.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|1H|mb|P2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is not an acceptable bid. It shows your strength, but mis-describes your distribution. You have a much more descriptive bid.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2dkp1016: With minor opening I am not showing strength.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you reverse you are longer in your first suit than your 2nd suit. In fact, your 2nd suit is almost always 4 cards in length. So if you bid 2@D that shows 5+ clubs and 4 diamonds.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your correct bid is 2N. Any time you can open or rebid some number of NT that is best as it is most descriptive.|UB||
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


MB|2N|SK||
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here we could play new minor forcing (e.g. 3@D asks about majors). But I personally prefer Checkback Stayman, which resembles new minor forcing but is slightly different and a bit better IMO. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way it works is if I bid 3@C, that is artificial and asks about the majors. It doesn't matter whether partner opened 1@C or 1@D. Therefore, playing Checkback Stayman, 2@C over 1NT or 3@C over 2NT asks about the majors regardless of which minor was opened.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The responses are the same except that opener rebids 3@D (rather than 3NT) with neither major. And that is the reason I like it better. It keeps the bidding lower in case responder wants to explore for the best contract. So we are going to play Checkback here.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|3C|mb|P|mb|3D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North denies 3 hearts and 4 spades. In this bidding cycle North, can have 2 hearts and 3 spades. He would bid 3@S if we reverse his holdings in major. And I can be 4-4 in the major or 4-5.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East does not have a good lead. His best guess as to what to lead is either a spade or a diamond.|

pc|S3|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is what many would lead. But on this hand it doesn't work out that well, but it gives nothing away as it turns out. Not an easy hand to play|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North played it pretty well but there was a slightly different way to play the hand in case the diamond finesse was off.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, North has 8 sure tricks--3 spades, 3 clubs, and 2 diamonds. So needs 1 more trick. The diamond finesse is 1 possibility. The other possibility is to place the @H10 with East.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So at trick 2, as we see here, I play the @HQ planning to play a heart to the 9 the next time hearts are played. That way if East has the @H10, the hand makes.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if West has it, North can still take the diamond finesse. This line provides an extra chance. But North's line was pretty good as well.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So passing by West worked out fine. North took a reasonable line although he should have ducked the first spade around to his hand. That way he has 2 spade tricks. 

If West has the @SA it doesn't matter. But if East has it, then ducking will generate a 2nd spade trick and North can make the hand as it turns out.|

UP|52|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2kiwi_2o1: Why not 1NT with West's hand over 1@S, or 2@C?|

@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not pass 1@S with the West hand and 1NT is a good choice. 2@C is reasonable as well. 1NT after partner passes shows a really good hand, 18 or 19. Regardless, I do agree that West is strong enough to take another bid.|

mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now since 2 suits have been bid, North promised exactly 4 spades and 4+ clubs.  With 5 spades he would overcall). Therefore, I can bid 2@C as I know we have a 8+ card club fit.|

mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That should tend to show 5 clubs. I would have passed with the North hand. His first double said it all. But we accept the bid.|

pc|D7|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us count tricks. Outside of trump I have 1 diamond and 2 spades. So I need 6 more tricks. If I am lucky in trump, I might be able to score 4 trump tricks by length and 1 with a ruff. Also I am going to hope that diamonds set up. Or that I can ruff 2 cards in one hand.|
