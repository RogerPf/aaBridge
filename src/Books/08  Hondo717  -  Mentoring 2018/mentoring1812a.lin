PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't like off shape doubles. My double was not off shape. I did only have 3 hearts but I was not 100% promising 4 although I will usually have 4 over 1@S. But @hKQJ is really good 3.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, you might double when you hold a doubleton honor in one of the minors if you don't want to pass. For example, say I held this @Sxx @HKJ10x @DAQxxx @CKx hand over 1@S. I would double.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner will strain to bid hearts and if he bids 2@C I will pass and hope we have a 7-card fit. Some people play something called ^*BEqual Level Conversion^*n. Then, if you play that, on some hands a double and correct does not show a good hand.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play that, then given the hand I just showed with 4 hearts and 5 diamonds, if partner responded 2@C over my double and I bid 2@D, that would not show extra values. It would simply say I doubled with hearts and diamonds and not clubs usually 4-5. I am not a big fan of Equal Level Conversion (abbreviated ELC) but a lot of experts are. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a bit confusing. I would rather just lie occasionally with a doubleton honor in a minor. I f you think about it, you rarely get double and correct hands anyway.|

PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Speaking of double and correct. If I bid spades and North then corrects to NT, that shows a bigger hand (19-21 HCP) than simply over calling 1NT. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, there is going to be a problem. I really like my hand even with only 4 HCP. We presumably have at least 8 spades, and often 9. Hands with a 5-5 distribution are worth way more than their point count. So assuming we have a spade fit, let me evaluate my hand using ^*bBergen Hand Evaluation.  ^*g:bergenhandevaluation::Hand Evaluation, (LINK  -  Bergen Hand Evaluation)^*n|

PG| ***** 33 ***** |


mb|2S|mb|P|mb|2N|nt||mb|P?|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am a bit worried. Partner no longer has to have 3 spades, and in fact probably does not but I don't want to pass. We could have a club fit. My 3@C bid,|mb|3c|at| should be forcing. Had partner not bid 2NT, that would be asking about a diamond stopper. But since he did bid 2NT that is not the case.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a control bid in diamonds, showing nice clubs and possibly looking for slam.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


mb|P?|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am definitely not interested in slam and, as you know, there are few hands where 5 of a minor is a better contract than 3N. But this is probably one of them. So I will bid 5@C and hope for the best.|mb|5C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is going to take a lot of planning. lets count tricks. I have 5 clubs and 2 aces for 7 tricks to start with. I can force a heart trick, that would be 8 tricks. I can ruff a couple of spades, that would be 10 tricks and I can either hope the @HQ is onside or I can get a 2nd heart trick because the @H9 drops or @HA is doubleton onside. so that is how I am going to play it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was what was known as a "dummy reversal." I ruffed so many times in the hand longer in trump that the dummy became the long trump hand.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Dummy reversals do come up from time to time. They are often hard to visualize, but you should think about them. Any time dummy has a long suit you are short in. So depsite the fact that we had only 23 HCP,we made 5 clubs (which normally requires 29 points or so). Again showing the power of good distribution.|

PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, I do not have the required distribution. I would be tempted anyway at this vulnerability if my high cards were in my longer suits. But my @DKQ doubleton is misplaced. If the KQ were in spades I might be tempted especially if the @HK were moved to clubs so all my cards were in my long suits.|mb|P|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


mb|2C|NT||mb|P|mb|2H|mb|P|mb|3H|mb|P|mb|4H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let me discuss the bidding. Once West finds out they have a heart fit I think West should bid 4@H. It's a bit aggressive. West has 10 Dummy Points (9 HCP and a doubleton). His hearts are pretty nice with 2 intermediate cards. So even if partner has a minimum with 15 declarer points game is close.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What about East? He has the opposite problem. I hate the 4-3-3-3 distribution. That probably downgrades my hand a point. But I do love the 3 aces, 3 1/2 quick tricks, and 16 HCP is better than 15. Further, bidding close vul games are a good idea, especially in IMPs.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, with the partners I play with they would probably bid 4 if they had a hand where it was making. So I would probably pass particularly at Matchpoints. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But bidding 4@H is not unreasonable. As it turns out, most of my partners would have bid 4 with the West hand so I wouldn't have had any decision.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*N: If I had only 15 and a flat hand I would have passed.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 16 and a flat hand you normally should pass also, unless it is a "good" 16. I would say, because of the aces and quick tricks, it is not good but not a min 16 either. So it is marginal as to whether to bid 4.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would have passed. But as I said, I would have bid 4 with West and as you can see, 4@H is not a great contract. Just like distributional hands are wonderful, flat hands are bad and should be downgraded. This is a good illustration of that.|

lb|*bWhat is the best imperfect call for North?^^2h|


mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North does not have a clear cut bid. However, the best bid from among all imperfect choices is 2@H. You should not be afraid to raise with 3-card support if no better bid is available. 2@H tends to show 4-card support, but, in fact, only promises three hearts. Raising with 3 to an honor, when all other rebids are worse, is okay and it also is somewhat encouraging.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An important bridge adage is "support with support." So given a choice of 2 bids, you should show support.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me introduce a useful but little known convention. It has several names. I call it "min max." I am going to bid 2NT. That is an artificial bid and asks partner about hand strength and number of hearts.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


mb|2N|NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Responses to 2NT are as follows:

 ^c3@C = 3 hearts and min dummy points (12-13 or so)
 
 ^c3@D = 3 hearts and max dummy points (14-16 or so)|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember the 2@H bid limited openers hand to no more than a bad 16.

 ^c3@H = 4 hearts and min dummy points
 
 ^c3@S = 4 hearts and max dummy points|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North technically has 14 dummy points if you add 2 for the singleton spade. But I don't like singleton aces. I would like the hand a lot better if the @SA were in one of the minors. In that case I think it is a clear 3@D bid but here I think 3@C is fine.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West made the correct lead against a NT contract. In suits you lead the top of a 2 card honor sequence. So in a suit contract the correct lead is the @SK. But in NT you lead top of a 3 card sequence or broken 3 card sequence. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A broken sequence is something like KQ10, QJ9 or J108. On this hand West does not have a 3 card sequence or broken sequence. So a low spade is correct.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


SK|S|NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me count tricks. I have 1 spade, 2 hearts, 2 clubs, and 1 diamond for 6 tricks. So I need 3 additional tricks either in clubs or in clubs and in hearts assuming they can't take 5 spades in the meantime. So I will start with clubs.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the club finesse loses I am down. If it wins then I have to hope that clubs are 3-2. My other choice is to start with hearts first and hope spades are 4-4 and hearts are 3-3 or distributed such that I can take a 3rd heart trick.|

mb|P|mb|1N?|cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT by East is correct. Always open 1NT with 15-17 and 5-3-3-2, 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3. Playing DONT I do have 5-4 distribution and I strain to compete with a slightly different hand, with the same HCP I might. I am 5-4 and I love having an ace and a king and I love the fact that they are in my long suits. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I don't like my distribution that much. I much prefer 5-4-3-1 or even better 5-5-2-1 or 5-4-4. Further, the unfavorable vulnerability is bad (they are not vul and we are vul) So I am going to pass. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Probably at favorable vul (I am not vul and they are vul) I would stretch and bid 2@D showing diamonds and a major. But not here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is Texas Transfer. Most of the time, 1N-4@D-4@H (Texas Transfer) is used when responder has a game forcing hand with a 6-card major to play in 4 of the major for with interest no interest in a slam.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, responder, instead of bidding Texas transfer, bids Jacoby transfer at the 2-level and move forward--1N-2@D-2@H-4@H. In this method, responder has a mild slam interest.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have no really good lead. I don't like leading away from kings. I don't like leading doubletons. So I will lead a trump by default although that could easily give away the suit.|pc|H7|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There was a slightly better way to play the hand. With 5 clubs, East could try and set up an extra club trick or 2, After drawing trump play 2 rounds of clubs and ruff a club. If clubs were 3-3, then East's 2 remaining clubs are good. On this hand they break 4-2.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But it doesn't really matter. Play a diamond, and assume I win and play a spade. Win the spade, ruff another club. Lead a diamond to the East hand. Play the last club and throw dummy's losing spade and make 5 taking 5 heart tricks, 1 spade, trick, 2 diamond tricks, and 3 club tricks.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


qx||NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you have a 5-card suit in a trump contract, you almost always should try and set it up. Let me show you how it is done. The first trick are the same. BTW, @SA is critical and should not be cashed until you knock off the @DA.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I have 2 small hearts or even 2 to an honor, North would not want us play in 4@H. North should consider 3N as the @SK is a great card.  In 4@H contract, I could lose 3 or 4 trump tricks on a bad day in 4@H.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even with a singleton small spade, with such weak hearts, North should not consider 4@H. If North had 5 nice hearts that is one thing. But 5 little is terrible for playing 4@H if I don't have nice hearts. In fact often even when I have 3-card support 3NT would still be a better contract.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^z@3^B@2^^^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|8-card fits, particularly after a preempt, when a 4-1 break is more likely are often not a walk in the park.|mb|3N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count what I have. I have 2 spades, 3 clubs and 3 diamonds for sure. That is 8 tricks. If diamonds break, that gives me a 9th. I could also force a 3rd spade trick. So I can try diamonds first. If they don't break. Then play spades and hope I don't lose 4 hearts.|
