Many less experienced players bid 3NT when they should rebid 2NT (18-19). But 3NT in this auction has a very special meaning. It shows a solid minor (diamonds in this case) and a hand where you think you can take 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand for example, it is likely I can take 6 diamonds and 2 aces. My partner is almost sure to have a trick or two given she responded. So 3N is very likely to make. If partner has a singleton or void in diamonds (void is very unlikely) I might go down.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the odds very heavily favor my making it. Most of the time responder passes but with a good hand and some diamond support they could try for slam (not on this hand).|mb|3N|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Or, I could just play for 3-3 diamonds. but then I still take 6 diamonds, 3 spades, and 2 clubs for 11 tricks if diamonds break. The point is, I need to plan the whole hand out before starting the play.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|3C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice bid by North. In 3rd seat, especially at favorable vul (you are not, they are) you should strain to preempt even with a pretty good hand. Let me explain a Marty Bergen principle about 3rd seat openers.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On average, after 2 passes, the 2 passers have approximately 16 HCP on average. That means 3rd and 4th seat have around 24 (16 + 24 = the 40 HCP that exist). So if 3rd seat subtracts his points from 24, that gives him a good idea of how strong the last seat is (East here). |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not exactly but usually pretty close. So on this hand North has 9. 24-9 = 15. That means East has around 15.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure what East should do over 3@C. I think pass is very reasonable although their side could have a game in hearts spades or even NT but no good way to find out. So pass is prudent.|

PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a minor, you want to avoid making marginal 2@C openers because after the 2@D response, you are already at the 3 level before any natural bidding starts.|

Partner must have clubs on this auction because of the jump shift to 2@S. Partner almost always has 5 clubs at least. With a balanced hand partner would bid 2N rather than 2@S.|mb|3C|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I decided to bid 3@C because my hearts are a little weak to bid 2N although it would not be a terrible bid. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could bid 3@D to show long diamonds. I do have 5, and they are ok but not great.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It would NOT show hearts if I had bid 3@H. It would be asking partner to bid 3N with a heart stopper. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, when you have a choice you should be guided by 2 principles:
^C1) support with support when you can;
^C2) make the cheapest reasonable bid to keep the auction lower.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By using those 2 principles I think my best bid was 3@C. As it turns out, 6@C is a reasonable contract. In fact on a good day you would make 7. But its hard to bid once North chooses to open 1@C which is correct.|

sk||mb|2D|mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West showed good judgment by passing with long hearts and short diamonds. The hand looks like a misfit. And when the hand is a misfit, you want to get out. Many players would try and rescue partner but you should not think like that.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because West has a nice hand, I wouldn't hate a 2N bid although the hand is not nearly as good as it looks. The 5 hearts are not worth much once North opens 1@H. And the singleton diamond is a big minus when partner overcalls 2@D.|

pc|CQ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an expert lead that I talked about several weeks ago. Normally the Q shows the J as we all know. But from AKQ experts lead the Q. That way if partner can see the jack they know the opening leader has AKQ when it wins the first trick.|

UP|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another unlucky hand where I would have made the wrong bid as North. I would have bid 5@D. Let us see how we do. We lose 1 diamond, 1 heart, and 1 spade at least. That is down 1 off the top.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Looking at winners we win 5 diamonds 3 clubs and 1 spade--losing another spade. Now that is down 2. Good thing tom was North instead of me.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in general on that auction, if you have a long suit and either a strong hand or a weakish hand you want to bid. I would pass with the East hand over 5@D.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure what I would do with the West hand. East has a pretty minimum 1@H opener. West can count on 2 tricks from partner so a double would not be too risky. But at this vulnerability they might be able to make 5@H. Although I would prefer the @DA to be in another suit where it fit better with partner.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I almost never lead from Qx unless partner bid the suit, where I lead Q from Qx.|

@CQ was the original lead. You can use different opening lead.
