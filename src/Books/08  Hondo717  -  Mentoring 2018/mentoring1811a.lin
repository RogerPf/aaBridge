^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players would open my hand in 3rd seat. But I prefer not to open at the 1 level unless my hand meets the rule of 20. I want partner to not worry about whether or not I have a real opening hand. Moreover, opening at the 1-level usually does not give 4th hand that much trouble.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you all know, I love to preempt in 3rd seat. But even using Bergen Adjusted Points my hand has 10 HCP + 1 quality suit point for 11 adjusted points. With only 8 cards in the 2 longest suits it does not meet the rule of 20. So I am passing.|mb|P|

^B@2^*BEast: ^*NIn response to one minor opener while holding two four-card majors, as what I am holding now, you should bid the hearts first. However, in this hand, my four-card  hearts is weak while the spades are good. Is there a pill for this headaches?|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The "system bid" is 1@H. But, as an option, you can decide to treat it as a 3-card suit and bid 1@S. That is okay. However, you might lose a heart fit. Granted with bad hearts, unless partner has 4 nice hearts (he won't have 5) the heart fit would not be great.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Do you want to reconsider East? Don't you need to have stoppers in unbid suits...and the heart stopper is not real. Further, 3@C is not forcing and shows 16-18.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now having cured that headache, let us talk about what West might should bid instead of 3@C.|sk|w|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C is a slight underbid. Many experts would bid 3N with the West hand. I explained that bid in a recent session. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Contrary to what many players think 3N as the first rebid by opener does not show 1 strong balanced hand. 3N shows a long running minor with the side suits stopped and likely to make 3N. 2N shows a balanced 18-19.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, although the diamond stopper is a bit dubious West has 7 sure tricks. And the opening lead, which might very well be a spade gives him an 8th trick. That means if partner has 1 trick, 3N is making. So the expert bid by West is 3N.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, as you will see when the four hands are opened, we theoretically can beat the hand. But in real life we are probably not going to. For all those points and also for additional teaching purpose let us ask West to bid 3N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure why North chose to lead a diamond. We can't rely on table talk.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^^^B@2^*BNorth^*n :It was just a guess.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, but spades were not bid and most would have led a spade.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that there is a case to be made for leading the @HA. The 3NT bid here says, that once West gets in, it is likely that their side has 9 tricks. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the @HA lead although very unusual against 3N gives North a chance to look at dummy and see if diamonds or spades are a better lead. So I will allow North to change his opening lead to the @HA.|

up|24|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine. In fact I like the defense. My main discussion will be on North's bidding. I am not sure what North should bid with his hand. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good case could be made for 4@H although at vul against not it might be a tad aggressive. However, North has 8 sure tricks--7 hearts and a diamond. So 4 hearts is at worst down 2.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if it is down the opponents can probably make game. Personally I would bid at least 3@H and possibly 4. Over 4@H, East would have a big problem. I probably would bid 4@S with the East hand as the least of evils.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| And that doesn't work out well. So even though, theoretically 4@H is down, quite often when you preempt, the opponents make an incorrect decision as to what to do.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^^^B@2^*BA Kib^*n: I am curious why you, as East, would bid 4@S with only 3, and partner has only promised 6 HCP?|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because I don't want to defend 4@H particularly after a preempt. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is more likely than not that partner has more than 4 spades. If one person has a long suit other players also tend to have long suits. Let me explain further.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By preempting you force the opponents to make decisions with very incomplete information. So on this hand, I would bid 4@S with East's hand as that seems the most likely bid to give us the best result. I am hoping partner has at least 5 spades even though he might have fewer.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^^^B@2^*BNorth^*n: I just don't want to be doubled and lose 500. So I did not bid 4@H.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a pessimistic way of looking at things. You need to be optimistic to be a good bidder. Most of the time aggressive bidding pays off. You can't be afraid to very occasionally get a bad result because most of the time you will get a good result.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unlikely North, with his great heart suit, will be doubled because the defense can't have long hearts and strong ones.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^^^B@2^*BNorth^*n: When I preempted and opponents knew they had more HCP than we had they might have had no choice but double.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good play even though it didn't work. North's line of play is very reasonable. But it would be down 1 unless you get lucky in hearts or diamonds. However, there is another possible line, if you think the heart finesse is more likely to lose than not. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Eliminating clubs by ruffing is normally very good technique. But, on this hand, it tips the defense off on how to defend. So another possible line, rather than ruffing a club is to play the @HA and another heart. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West will win the @HK and probably play, most players do at regular table, another club. North can ruff and draw the last trump. Then North plays a spade to the ace and duck a spade. Now East is end played.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You make 5. So the question is should declarer try for a 12th trick and risk only taking 10 tricks. Or should he just take his sure 11 tricks I would just take sure 11.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Right idea by East. Normally 2@S is to play. But East's hand just got a lot better on the auction. Let's count his dummy points. He has 14 HCP, 1 length point 1 quality suit point, and 2 points for singleton and 3 trump. That's 18. So 3@S is nice bid. In fact, I would probably bid 4 as I love the hearts and the @CA. But 3@S is acceptable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, West has 4@S bid. If West has as little as @SK and @SQ the hand is likely to make 4@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your choices, @DA, or @SA, or possibly club, are all poor. Given East is short in diamonds I probably lead a spade. But lead what you want.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. Turns out a club lead holds them to 4. But I think the spade lead is better in general.|

hondo717: But I love to make aggressive preempts in 3rd seat. Here is a good rule to follow when opening in 3rd seat. It turns out, after 2 passes, on average, the 2 passed hands hold 16 HCP which means that 3rd seat and 4th seat hold 24 HCP between them on average. If you subtract your HCP from 24 in 3rd seat you know approximately how many HCP 4th seat is likely to have. Here assuming East is going to pass, I would subtract my 6 HCP from 24 and figure that West has about 18 HCP on average. So I would want to make it as difficult as possible for the opponents. Therefore, despite only have 5 so-so hearts I would open a weak 2@H bid in 3rd seat.
