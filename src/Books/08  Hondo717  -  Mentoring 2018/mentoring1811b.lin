^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First off, let's see how we do in 5@C. Looks like we lose 1 club, 1 heart, and 1 spade for down 1. This hand illustrates the power of distribution. 6-4 hands are very powerful on offense. Both North and East had 6-4 hands. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had North rebid 3@C instead of doubling, I might have decided to bid 5@C. However, on the auction, I had no way of knowing that North had 6 clubs making it harder for me to sacrifice. Had I known we had a 10-card fit, that makes it easier. Whenever you have a 6-card suit, that is usually the suit your side wants to play in. Keep that in mind.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding the 2@H bid over 1@S, I play new suits by advancer (partner of the overcaller) are forcing. But many do not. If 2@H is forcing that is a good bid and is the bid I would have made. But if it were not forcing I would have bid 2@C to show a limit raise or better.|

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I need to lead back my ^*Bremaining count^*N. So if I had a doubleton left, I would lead my higher spade, to show 2 remaining. With 3 left (as I have in this hand), I lead a low spade.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||SK|N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, because of the auction it turns out North knows I have at least 4 spades. Because West denied a 4-card major meaning West has at most 3 spades. That leaves me with 4 or even possibly 5 to start with.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine. East starts with 1 spade trick, 4 heart tricks, and 1 diamond trick for sure. West needs 2 more tricks. The @DQ is one possibility as one more trick. Also, if the @CA is onside,  the @CK is possible as a trick as well. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately there are limited entries to dummy. Otherwise, clubs probably offer a slightly better possibility of developing 2 tricks than diamonds. If South has the @CA and another club honor then West can develop 2 club tricks. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But West needs to lead towards clubs twice to set up the 2nd trick and with the limited dummy entries that is not possible. So I don't hate the diamond play although that is down 1 even if it works. All in all, just a bad fit with little possibility of making.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most players would bid 2@D with my hand. I clearly can't bid 2@H as that is a reverse and my hand is not strong enough to reverse. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent a good rebid, whenever you open 1 of a minor and partner opens 1@S, it is sometimes correct to rebid 1NT even with a singleton spade. That is the only time you should rebid 1NT with a singleton. It is slightly dangerous because partner should assume you have at least 2 spades. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But sometimes it is the least of evils. Here it is close. I think both 1N and 2@D are flawed and I am not sure which is more flawed.|mb|2D|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||mb|P|mb|3c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is forcing asking me to bid 3N with a heart stopper or 3@S with 3 card support. I am not sure North is quite strong enough to make that bid. I probably would have chosen 3@D with North's hand. But I don't hate 3@C, just think it is slightly aggressive and 3@D is probably closer to what the hand is worth.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the heart void, since I have a minimal opener hand, I reject North's invitation. With the heart void. I might even bid 4@D with the North hand or 3@C intending to bid 4@D over 3N. Another possibility is 3@H, now that I think of it, is an unusual bid but should be a splinter showing good diamonds and heart shortness. Let's keep the 3@H bid.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|P?|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I like my hand a lot better. Opposite heart shortness, the best holdings are 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the ace. That's a great fit from my perspective. So I might try 5@D here.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a different hand 3N would be possible. That is what makes 3@H such a flexible bid. So I decided, despite my weak opener, I love my hearts opposite the splinter and will try for 5@D but not be surprised if it goes down.|mb|5D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a case where I think North was a bit too aggressive particularly because of being vul. Down 2 not vul would not be so bad. It is only -100. But -200 is probably not a great result. However, if EW can make something it is probably not horrible.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that absent a bid by North, East has a perfect Garbage Stayman bid. East would bid 2@C (which I would double BTW as lead directing). You should always take the opportunity to make lead directing doubles over artificial bids such as transfers and Stayman and responses to RKCB.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, I still encourage you that when in doubt make a DONT bid. Most players are not aggressive enough. Generally, you should err on the side of being aggressive rather than not. In the long run, it will pay off much more often than it hurts you.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Turns out it didn't give anything away. But leading away from an unprotected king is often dangerous in a suit contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2@C did not work out so well. The bad break didn't help, But on the other hand, East was lucky West had 3 clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 1NT was the better rebid by East. Rebidding an unsupported weakish 5-card suit at the 2-level is very dangerous. Sometimes you have no choice. But here East had a better choice. Generally, you should avoid rebidding an unsupported weak 5-card suit if you have a better choice.|
