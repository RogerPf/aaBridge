It would be too dangerous to bid 1NT opposite a partner with < 6 if you had only 12-14. And if you had 15-17, you would have opened 1NT. So therefore, 1NT in this auction must promise 18 or 19.|mb|1N|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, as responder, if partner bids 2 suits, and you have only a 5-card suit, it is not usually right to bid it. Because partner has bid 2 suits, it is unlikely he has more than a doubleton in responder's suit and might even have a singleton.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you should try and avoid rebidding a 5-card suit when partner has bid 2 other suits. And, on this auction, 1NT is one trick less than 2@H which is another reason why 1NT is slightly preferable even though North has no diamond honors. Having 5 diamonds means the opponents would not be able to take too many diamonds.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, you just need a 6-card suit. If partner has an average number of cards in your suit (2), you have an 8 card fit and even with no points you will take 3 tricks.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if partner has 3 card support you might take 4 tricks. Frankly, I would seriously consider passing with the East hand.

Even if you have a marginal overcall, if you think partner is going to end up on lead and you can make an overcall that directs the lead you should do so.|

But an expert lead is West should first lead the @DA to show the @DK. Then West can lead the club as partner requested. You should lead partner's suit.|
