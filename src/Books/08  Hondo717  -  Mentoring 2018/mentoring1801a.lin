nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why do you want to run them out of trumps. East can't possibly have any more spades. Unless you think I opened 4 with a 6-card suit. There is nothing wrong with leading back another spade. Making declarer ruff is at worst a neutral play. And sometimes when you have long trump it shortens declarer trumps.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If declarer only had 5 trump a spade would be a very good play since that would shorten her trump to 4 and you have 4 trumps. Having the same length as declarer is often a good thing. In this deal the way to get rid of declarer's trump is to make her ruff a spade.|

mb|1D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't mind 1@D, but the modern style is to open 1@C with 3-3 in the minors. That way, you almost always have 4 diamonds when you open 1@D. However, you could also decide to play "better minor" which is what West did. In that style, you open the suit which is better when 3-3 in the minors.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But most would open 1@C with the West hand these days. In fact, some play "short club" meaning they won't open 1@D unless they have 4+ and will open 1@C when they have 4-4-3-2 distribution. I don't like short club particularly, but I don't hate it either so long as responder passes with a very weak hand even if short in clubs.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had a singleton spade and maybe 9 or 10 points I might overcall 3@H anyway. But you don't preempt over a preempt. If you bid over a preempt you are showing an opening hand at least.|mb|P|

PG| ***** 127 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because then when it wins, partner knows you have the Ace. These days we lead Ace from AK on opening lead. That is a new treatment. It used to be you lead King from AK and you still do in the middle of the hand.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see how do they do in 4@S? Assuming they play for a 2-2 spade break, they make 4, losing  two clubs and 1 heart. So -500 is better than -620 even with the bad break.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what North should bid, it is not clear. With a singleton spade heart and doubleton heart, 5@C is clear, but it is not as clear with the hand as is (although I probably bid it anyway). |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to how many tricks it is down. It is hard to say. It depends on how the defense goes and how declarer decides to play the hand. |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, after cashing 2 spade tricks, if the defense leads trump every time they are in, I can only see declarer taking 8 tricks - 6 clubs, a diamond ruff, and the @HA. That is down 3.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, East-West can make 4@S so 5@H down 3 is still a good result because of the favorable vulnerability.|

^-{You may now play this hand double dummy by clicking the cards you want to play. 
@HQ was the original lead. You can use different opening lead.
