It does have the advantage of discovering whether opener has either a 4-card major or a 5-card major.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I have a 5-card major, I would bid it now over 3@C. If I have neither 4 or 5-card major I bid 3N. And if I have a 4-card major I bid 3@D. Right after the play there would be further information on how the responder figures which 4-card major I have.|

pc|H7|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically the hand comes down to the diamond suit. The heart situation is unfortunate for me. If I held one more heart in either hand, then I would have 2 heart stoppers. But I don't. Regardless, I have to work with what I have and decide how to play the diamond suit.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using the "8 ever 9 never" rule, I could play for the drop in diamonds. However, as I have said before, that only applies when you have no information about the hand. In this case the heart lead (since the @H6, 4, 3, and 2 are missing) indicates that West has at least 5 hearts and could easily have 6.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given no additional information, playing for the queen to drop in a 9-card fit is only a little over 50%. Therefore, the finesse is almost as good. Further, once I know West has a 5+ card suit. That makes it more likely that West is short in diamonds.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case the finesse is indicated, since the odds now are higher than 50% that it will work. So that is how I am going to play the hand. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In addition, West does not know how many hearts I have. But once the first round of hearts are play, West is going to know I have the @HJ (since with the @HQJ East would have played the J). So even if the finesse loses, West may decided not to lead a heart because my @HJ might set up. Let us see how it goes.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am even more confident that I should play East for the @DQ because West has shown 3 spades and 5 hearts at least. That means West only has at most 5 cards in the minors. And with 7 clubs missing, it is more likely that West started with more clubs and fewer diamonds.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the key points on this hand are a) to win the first heart trick to make it harder for West to lead hearts if West gets in and b) after playing one round of diamonds in case the @DQ is singleton take the diamond finesse rather than playing for the drop.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, there are many hands where, even with a 9-card fit you should take the finesse against the queen. ^*N|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason for that is, if I have extra length (e.g. we have a 10+ card fit) it doesn't matter whether or not I have the @DQ because it will drop.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Its okay in general.  But once you know North is short in diamonds you need to be worried about a singleton. You know about the diamond shortage based on the bidding. So you shouldn't duck the @DA.|

mb|1D|mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a rare bid. Here 4@H shows a "self-sufficient" heart suit (at most 1 loser opposite a singleton) and little outside.|mb|4H|

pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has an interesting problem. 4@S over 4@H is often correct particularly when you know there is a 9-card fit. I think it is a reasonable call particularly at favorable vul (EW not vul, NS vul).|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


sk||nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But there are some arguments against it. 
^c@2a) West does not know East has 6 spades, and west's spades are weak. 
b) West has good defense. 
c) West's diamond cards are badly placed given the 1@D opener. So 4@S is far from clear.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to 1@S or 2@S bid by East, I agree that 2@S would have been better which then makes West's 4@S bid much more clear cut with the known 9-card fit.|

TexasJudy1: Would you advise overcalling my hand as 3@S?|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For sure. You have a weak 2 in spades bid with nothing outside of spades. As I said, that makes it much easier for West to bid 4@S. When you bid 1@S West has a difficult decision.|
