^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is good enough to open 1@H, ^*nRule of 20^*n. ^*g:ruleof20::Hand Evaluation, (LINK  -  Rule of 20 Tutorial)^*n.  Having said that, often in 3rd seat you preempt with an opening hand just to make it harder for 4th seat. The idea is, once partner passes, it is unlikely you have game when you have a min opener. But since I have spades, and if we have a fit, we might even make 4@S, I will open 1@H.|mb|1H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North certainly should not pass. I personally would bid 2@S, although its a little light. 

A ^*bNegative Double^*N is okay also. ^*g:negativedoubles::All Doubles, (LINK  -  Negative Double)^*n.  The reason I prefer 2@S is that way you can show 5 spades. A Negative Double only promises 4 although on this auction it can be more than 4.|mb|2S|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This illustrates why Bergen Hand Evaluation is so important. Many players emphasize HCP too much and de-emphasize distribution. So they might think they have a weak hand after the 2@S bid. But on this hand, distribution almost doubles the value of the hand. Bergen Hand Evaluation gives you a scientific way of evaluating distribution.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hard hand to play unless you figure out to set up dummy. Always, it is  important you keep track of your long side suits.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So despite the fact we had only 20 HCP we made 4@S. Again, showing the value of distribution. In fact, our side did not even need the @DA or @DQ or @CJ. We could have made 4@S with 13 HCP. The main point is, you MUST count distribution and not just HCP.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way West played the hand, he was guaranteed to only make 5 no matter who had the @CK. And since East had spade length, the bidding worked out okay. But I think rather than doubling, West should just bid 3NT. He is a tad strong (it should show 15-18). But given partner is a passed hand, it is likely to be a reasonable contract. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On average my preempt gives me around 7 or 8 points. That means between West and South, there are an estimated 27 points. That means North and East have 13 points. Assuming they are split approximately evenly, that means East has 6 or 7 points. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, East/West having a combined 25 HCP or so, they have enough to make 3N and I think West's best action is to bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West in fact, will be playing "2 against 1", since I preempted and he has 3 hearts, he knows my partner is short in hearts. So, as long as he finesses through me, partner cannot lead very many hearts meaning my hand is irrelevant to him.|

That is one of my favorite conventions. Here East can double to show a 1 suited hand. However, I think East is too weak especially vulnerable. Play DONT here, if I pass, West must bid 2@C. If East's suit were clubs, then East passes. Otherwise (as on this hand) East bids his suit which is 2@D.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Please, note that I am 5-4 in the majors with a game forcing hand. Therefore. I have a clear 4@S bid because North bid 2@S. On the other had North bid 2@D denying four-card plus major, we might still have a 5-3 heart fit. To find such fit, if any and make sure the stronger hand, North here declares some people play the Smolen convention.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


mb|4S|sk||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play Smolen, then a jump to 3 of a major shows 5 cards in the other major and 4 cards in the major bid. So on this hand, playing Smolen, over hypothetical 2@D bid by North, I would bid 3@S to show 4 spades and 5 hearts.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|People play Smolen so the strong hand gets to declare. If the 1NT bidder has 3 hearts, they can bid 4@H. Otherwise, they will bid 3N. In either case the strong hand will be the declarer.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Smolen convention is okay, so long as partner remembers. But since it rarely comes up, many partners forget about it. So that is why I think it is better if you just play 3@H by me shows 5 hearts and 4 spades. Having the strong hand play, although sometimes desirable, is highly overrated.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West will play a club for East to trump. The club played by West is a "suit preference" signal. The size of the spot tells partner which suit to lead back.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, playing the @C4 asks for a diamond lead back as it is a low card. A high club spot (the @C9 here) asks partner for the higher remaining suit (hearts here). A middle spot (the @C8 here) says West has no preference.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That does not mean you should not preempt in 2nd seat. It just means you should avoid marginal preempts. On this hand some arguments can be made for opening 3@C.

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has very nice clubs. It is a quality suit with 4 honors which is pretty rare. Bergen has another name for such a suit. He calls it a "great suit" and says (although I don't totally agree) that you can treat "great" suits as being one longer than they really are. In that case, East can treat clubs as if they are 7 cards in length, which justifies the 3@C preempt.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. The 3@C bid did work out. Absent the 3@C opener, West should open 1@H and they may end up in hearts or we might end up in spades. West, however, should not rescue partner by bidding 3@H. You don't rescue partner. It could easily be misfit. Once partner preempts, you almost always want to play in partner's suit.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In hearts, they have at least 8 tricks--6 hearts (since the heart finesse works) and 2 aces. In 3@h, West might try the club finesse and make 9 tricks. In spades North/South don't do particularly well. They lose 2 hearts, 2 diamonds and 2 clubs at least. So I would say the 3@C bid is probably an average plus in Matchpoints.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me do some planning. For top tricks we have 4 spades 1 heart and 1 diamond. So we need 2 more tricks. We can set up a sure heart trick. We also have a good shot at setting up 2 diamond tricks if West holds at least one diamond honor.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is what I will try. If it works, I have 8 tricks. If it doesn't, then I hopefully still will be able to take the heart finesse or club finesse.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this board, passing 2N worked out best and it was the correct action. But if we went down in 2N or made 3N, then bidding 3N would have either been a good result or just about irrelevant. So, in general, when partner invites you to bid 3N by bidding 2N you should strain to bid 3N.|
