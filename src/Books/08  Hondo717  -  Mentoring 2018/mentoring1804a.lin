%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|b|CS|1|CP|4|FP|2|at|^-{   How I play Inverted Minor Raises - by Howard     }
^-|CP||fp||at|
^B@21) If I make a minor raise (to either the 2 level or 3 level), I am guaranteed to have no 4-card major. 

2) I make a jump raise (to the 3 level) with 5 to a bad 9 points and a 5+ card suit. I might have the other minor, but feel that the jump raise is tactically the right thing to do to make it difficult for the opponents. I will tend to prefer the jump raise to a bid of 1N if I have 5-card support.

3) I make a limit raise with 10+ points and usually 5-card support. (The only time I will have 4-card support is if I am 4-4 in the minors and partner opens 1@D.) If partner opens clubs, I will not have 4 diamonds. If partner opens diamonds, I will not have 5+ clubs (in SAYC; in 2 over 1,  1@D/2@C is slightly more complicated).

4) Opener should now respond with his lowest stopper. If responder has less than a game-forcing hand, he should continue to bid stoppers below three of the agreed upon suit, or 2N if he has ^*Ball the other suits stopped^*N. 

5) If responder has a game-forcing hand, he must make sure the partnership bids game by either bidding 3N, if all suits are stopped, or continue bidding new suits, if not. Again, new suits are forcing.

6) Similarly, if opener has 15+ points, it is his responsibility to make sure the partnership reaches game by either bidding 3N, if all suits are stopped, or continuing to bid new suits, if not. 

7)|FP|2|AT| Once 3 suits have been bid (the original suit and 2 stopper suits), if someone bids the fourth suit, that is asking about a stopper rather than telling, because if the bidder has the remaining suit stopped, he can bid NT himself. |FP||at|

8) Inverted minors are off in competition (including over takeout doubles), in the sense that a raise to 2 is less than a limit raise. A raise to 3 is still pre-emptive.


^*BMM: We will now return to the table and continue the bidding from the point we left off.^*N|

UP|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North had an opportunity to make additional trick because at trick 6 declarer mistakenly forgot to cash the @DK to discard a heart. Then North can visualize a better defense.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North knows West is out of clubs and based on the bidding is out of diamonds (North had 4, South had 5 based on the overcall, East had 3, so West started with 1).|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if North gets out with a spade after winning the trick with @SK then North will win a heart tricks. That is the expert play. However, as I said, West could have avoided the entire problem by cashing the @DK before leading a spade.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other comment. North should seriously consider doubling 4@S to make sure South does not take a 5@D sacrifice. In this instance, there is a good chance South is short in spades and might in fact decide to sacrifice in 5@D. So North should double to make sure that does not happen.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West correctly guessed who had the @SJ and therefore made 2 spade tricks. But I would have guessed differently. I would have played North for the @SJ (which would not have worked here). Why?|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since South is known to have 5 hearts, he is more likely to be short in the other suits. Therefore it is more likely that North has more spades than South (not true here, but true in general).|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| And the person with more spades is more likely to have a specific spade (in this case the spade jack).|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once West establishes 7 tricks, she should cash them. After cashing 2 clubs, and discovering clubs did not break, she should cash her @SQ, guaranteeing 7 tricks. |
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Instead she exited with a diamond. Here it turned out I had to give her the @SQ after all.|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on a different defense (if I had kept a 2nd diamond and discarded my @SJ), we would have taken the rest of the tricks and defeated 1NT by one trick.|
