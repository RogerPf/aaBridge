With enough points to force to game North can bid 1@D with 4 diamonds and a 4-card major. But if you only have a weak response, as North does, then you bypass diamonds and bid your major.|mb|1S|

pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^e2@S = 13-16 Dummy Points.
^e3@S = 17-19 Bergen Dummy Points (not forcing but highly invitational).
^e4@S = 20+ Bergen Dummy Points.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 20+ dummy points and 4-card support, your other choice is to splinter (e.g. 4@D with a singleton diamond). So 4@S denies a singleton as well.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 18 HCP, 1 length point, and 2 points for the 2 doubletons for a total of 21. It is more than enough to bid 4@S. And since I have no shortness, that is my correct bid. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that 4@S is NOT a close out. It shows 20 points. If responder has a really good hand (e.g. 13+) they can and should look for slam. Most of the time responder will pass, but they are NOT obliged to do so.|mb|4S|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So whenever you can take all the tricks but one run all your tricks. The defenders will often have discarding problems. Sometimes you will have a real squeeze as on this hand. And other times the opponents will discard incorrectly giving you an extra trick anyway.  That is called a "pseudo squeeze." 
|n#|b|at|In any case, the situation where you have all winners but one comes up a lot and there is no reason not to run your winners and hope that you have either a real squeeze or a pseudo squeeze. |

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for East.^^4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Upon hearing West has 3 spades and 15-17 point, East needs to count his Declarer Points. You already know, even though East is officially dummy, in using Bergen Hand Evaluation, he counts Declarer Points because the hand with the long trump counts Declarer Points.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Usually the hand with the long trump bids their suit first. But occasionally, mostly with transfer auctions, the hand with long trump ends up as dummy. Regardless, they still count Declarer Points in terms of evaluating their hand. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 9 HCP, 1 length point, 2 for singleton, and 1 for 4-card side diamond suit for 13 Declarer Points. That is easily more than enough to bid game.|mb|4S|

I probably lead a spade since I hate leading @DK from @DKQ.|pc|S9|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Due to the bad breaks in diamonds and spades and clubs also the contract went down. But it was a good contract. Also it was well played, However, the breaks were against declarer.|
