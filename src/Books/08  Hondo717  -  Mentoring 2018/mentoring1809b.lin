up|37|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine. As to the bidding I could bid either 1@S or 2@S. If partner were not a passed hand, I might choose 1@S. But once partner is a passed hand, it is less likely we have game. 

So I wanted to interfere. From my hand there was a good chance they had a heart fit (as it turns out that is not true). But more often than not they will. So 2@S makes it harder for them to find their heart fit when they have it.|

PG| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|2d|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D bid is very wrong because a) it denies 3 or 4 hearts and b) it shows a weak hand. You need to do a heart raise. My choice would be 4@H but you could bid 2NT to show a limit raise if you like. To me that is the best bid on this hand. If East redoubles, that also denies 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BEast:^*N   I almost bid 4 hearts. I thought I was taking too much space in case he had a big hand.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unlikely you have slam and you want to crowd the bidding making it hard for us to find our spade fit. Moreover, with 4 hearts and 10 points, East should bid 2N.|

However, you need to be a little more cautious when vul against not vul. But when in doubt, follow that rule. So I will.|mb|4S|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


mb|5H|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good bid. West knows they have an 11 card fit, and no spade losers. Since the opponents have at least a 9-card fit West is more worried about missing 6 than not making 5. Although 6 is unlikely given the double.|

PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It shows 5 hearts. It tends to show less than a limit raise. A void or singleton is nice but not required.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|6@S was a bad bid because there was no upside. Granted that if they make 6@H it is probably a bad board for us. But by bidding 6@S he is guaranteeing we get a bad board because many pairs probably wont be in 6. So we won't beat those pairs and we might set 6@H.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out in 6@H by opponents we had 2 diamond tricks off the top. But by bidding 6@S and we got a bottom instead of a top. The point is, don't make a bid that, even if it works, will probably get you less than an average result.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see, despite the fact that our side only has 22 HCP because of the nice distribution (heart void) we did ok in 5@S. Unfortunately. they are down 1 in 5@H. But if my @HA had been somewhere else and not wasted with partner's void say it was the @DK instead which is one less HCP we would have made 5@S. So I think everyone bid correctly.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, the odds of a bad break are higher with a preempt and with a possible 8 card fit, it is better to be cautious.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, on this hand I play Bergen Raises are on. My hand is worth 10 Dummy Points-6 HCP, 1 length point, 3 for the singleton with 4 trump. If you chose to make 3@C bid as a 7-9 raise (3@D in Reverse Bergen) I would not say that is wrong.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I really like my club singleton given the 2@C bid. So I am treating this as a limit raise.|MB|3C|

mb|4C|mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good pass by North. North has a min opener. Further,I like the 4@C bid by West. However, there is an issue of tactics. West must think what is he going to do if we bid 4@S? You always need to think about that when you bid 4 of a minor over their major in a competitive auction.|

up|45|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@S, we lose 2 (diamonds are 3-3 and spades are 2-2 ) diamonds and club. So luckily we make 4. Therefore, 4@C was a good bid over 3@S as it turns out.|

mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I might very well open 1@S with the East hand but using Bergen adjusted HCP East has 11 HCP -1 for Jx of hearts. So technically it doesn't meet the rule of 20. But I like the intermediate cards (10, 9, 8) in spades and diamonds plus 2 quick tricks.|

mb|P|mb|3N|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3NT bid is not a good idea. First of all if you were going to do that, then you might as well bid 2N over 2@S. Second of all how many points do you think I have?|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They have shown around half the deck (20 or maybe 19 or 18 at worst). That leaves me with at most 2-4. I don't think you want to play 3N with 20-22 points between us.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Balanced hands, especially strong ones, are very deceptive. I like to bid, but I really dislike balanced hands. And with strong balanced hands, I am more likely to pass and defend even though I really like to declare because strong balanced hands are bad on offense and good on defense.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North either has to pass 2@S, or bid 2N over 2@S, or pass whatever I bid if she chooses to double. The bidding by North was very inconsistent.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to review the bidding, be aggressive with distributional hands and be conservative with balanced hands. And with strong balanced hands often it is better to defend than declare especially if you think the opponents have balanced hands as well.|
