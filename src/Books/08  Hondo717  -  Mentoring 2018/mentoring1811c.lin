^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding and defense were fine. But notice a couple of declarer play techniques I employed. The most important one was, at trick four, winning the club trick with the @CA rather than the @CK.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That way West did not know who had the @CK. If East held the @CK, the @CQ is still the correct play. Had I won the @CK, West would know I also have the @CA, because East would have played the @CA if he had it.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 principles illustrated by the previous discussion:

a) When playing 3rd hand, you play the lowest of a touching sequence (e.g. Q from KQ). That gives partner more information than playing high. So playing the @CQ denied the @CJ (because from @CQJ East would play the @CJ) but does not deny the @CK.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|

b) Declarers also wants to hide his cards from the defense and plays highest from a sequence to hide their cards. By playing the @CA from @CAK, I hide the location of the king. So the defense does not know whether or not I hold it.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, as I said, had I played the @CK on the @CQ, then the defense would know I have the @CA.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss and revise the biddings so far. First, let us count North's Dummy Points. North has 10 HCP, -1 for dubious @HQx, + 1 for quality club suit (3 honors), and, + 1 for doubleton for a total of 11.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S shows 6-9 presumably. Having said that, since East opened 1@C, if you wanted to not count the quality club suit because of the bidding, that would be okay. Therefore, that combined with a very bad 3-card support means you could downgrade and bid 2@S.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The alternative is to show a limit raise by cue bidding the opponents suit--bidding 2@C. I like that slightly better.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the 3@D bid, I don't really like that. It is dangerous although East is not vulnerable. If West does not have diamonds, it would force the bidding to the 4 level. I think a takeout double might be slightly better as it gives more flexibility to partner to respond.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, the takeout double is slightly flawed in that East would like to have 4 hearts. But of the 4 conceivable bids by East, double, 3@C, 3@D, or pass double is my first choice and pass is my 2nd. choice. So let us change the 3@D.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should love 6-4 hands, and using Bergen evaluation it will let you see why. I have 12 Starting Points--11 HCP, -1 for dubious DQ, + 2 length points. To count my Declarer Points, I can add 2 for the singleton, 1 for the 4-card side suit, and 1 for the 6th spade once we find a fit reaching 16 Declarer Points. That is not quite enough to be in game since partner is restricted to 9.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with my distributional hand, I want to compete. In a competitive auction, if you simply raise your suit, that is simply competing. It does not show extra values. So if I bid 3@S here, that simply says I am not willing to sell out below 3@S. It does not show anything extra.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I want to show extras I must make another bid, such as 3@H or even redouble. But I do not have enough points to be in game, I don't want to sell out at the 3-level, and will bid 3@S. This is an important treatment that most experts play and many non-experts do not.|mb|3s|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^^^B@2^*BKib^*n: Haven't you already added 2 length points?|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is true, but once we find a fit, Bergen allows you to add 1 point for a 6-card suit, 2 points for a 7 card suit, etc.. So the fit allows me to count 3 length points so to speak not just 2.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand illustrates the power of distribution. And also why one of my defensive principles with all my partners is "You never lose the post mortem discussion if you lead my suit." So since East bid clubs, I would have led a club.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally a cue bid by me over a double would show a game forcing hand. However, because I am a passed hand, the cue bid here shows an intermediate hand and gives partner a choice of suits. With only 8 HCP and a doubleton I am stretching the meaning of an "intermediate" hand. Of course, I do have 2 aces which are actually worth more than 8 HCP.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In theory, there should be a difference between the 2@C and 2@D bid. There should be a partnership agreement. I would say a reasonable treatment would be that 2@C shows better hearts (the lower suit) and 2@D (the higher cue) shows better spades (the higher suit).|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A responsive double is another good choice. I personally think responsive dbl is the best bid. However, some people don't play responsive doubles except over raises.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is fine with the West hand. But since I hate letting them play at the 1 level, I would probably bid 2@D and hope partner has at least 5. 1N over my double is also a reasonable choice. Anyway here we are at 1@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs probably a couple of IMPs for NS. Had West chosen to rebid 1NT over my responsive double and there was a heart lead, West probably takes 8 tricks. Having said that, North might bid 2@H over 1NT which as you note that goes down.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Down 1 is probably fine as we probably make 3@C. BTW, one point about the bidding which a kib was nice enough to point out to me and I missed.North should make a  Negative Double ^*g:negativedoubles::All Doubles, (LINK  -  Negative Double)^*n. Its a very descriptive bid on this particular auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever the auction starts 1@C-1@D-dbl, the doubler is showing exactly 4 hearts and 4 spades which allows opener to figure out the best spot for the contract. It turns out, even after the negative double if East bids 3@D I have to pass. But at least that way, North got the hand across allowing me to make a more intelligent decision.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know we have at least a 9 card diamond fit and my @HQ is probably worth something. So despite my weak hand, I have a clear 3@D bid by the Law Of Total Tricks if nothing else.|mb|3D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This pass, in this auction, is what is known as a "forcing pass" situation. Since EW voluntarily bid game to make they should not allow us to play in any contract undoubled. So East's pass says he is not sure what to do over 5@D. He is giving West the option of doubling or bidding 5@S. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West is not allowed to pass. Hence East's pass is "forcing." The concept of forcing pass can be complicated. The basic idea is if you voluntarily bid a game to make you cannot allow the opponents to play undoubled in a contract. You either have to double them or bid 1 higher in your suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice bidding on this hand. In spades they lose 1 heart, and 1 diamond. However, if spades don't break they could end up losing 2 spades. So I think 5@D doubled is best. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs it wont make that much difference because +500 is not that much worse than +650. They will probably lose 3 or 4 IMPs, not great but not terrible.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But had 5@S gone down, they would have lost a lot of IMPs. Should West double or bid 5@S? I think in IMPs West made a good decision to double. In Matchpoints, I might bid 5@S because of the singleton diamond. But its lucky that 5@S makes.|
