At trick 8, as you see now, when West leads a low spade, North should play the @SJ. That will win and then North can lead another club which will make my @H9 good (promote it).|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a case where you should play the @SJ although 2nd hand low is almost always right. But if you have a good reason to play 2nd hand high you can. Let us go back to that trick and look at it.|

mb|P|mb|1S|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a problem hand with 2/1. I can't make a 4-card spade raise. I can't bid 2@H because that promises 5 cards. So I have to make a 2@C bid. When partner opens 1@S and as responder you have a game forcing hand with 3-4-3-3 distribution you have to bid 2@C with 3 clubs. That is the only time.|mb|2c|

Kib: What about Forcing NT?|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is not correct. That denies a game force and I have a game force. You should not bid 1NT when you have game forcing values.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Another Kib: With 5-5 in clubs and spades the advice seems to be split as to which you open first?|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the old days, with 5 clubs and 5 spades, opener would start with 1@C and rebid spades twice and you can still do that if you wish. |
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the modern consensus is to open 1@S because you want to get your major in before the opponents interfere. And you want to lay claim to the spade suit when you can. However if you decide that you want to open 1@C with those hands and partner agrees that is reasonable.|

dododo42: Should I have jumped to game?|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. You should bid 3@C. You don't know where we are playing yet. It could be 3NT, 4@S, 5@C or possibly slam.  We overlook a possible 3@H bid which is a splinter in support of clubs.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again I have an interesting problem. On the one hand I have 14 HCP and 1 quality suit = 15. But my 4-3-3-3 distribution downgrades my hand. Not to mention that partner thinks I have clubs when I really don't.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You do need to be aware that a 4@S bid by me is weaker than a 3@S bid because in 2 over 1 one of the principles you need to know is something called "fast arrival."|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once a game force is established, if you jump to game rather than going slowly you are showing a weak hand. 2@C is a game force. We won't stop until we reach game. If you have interest in slam you don't jump. So the question is, do I want to try for slam. It's marginal, but let's try it by me bidding 3@S.|mb|3S|

But using Bergen hand evaluation, North has 12 "adjusted HCP"|HC|HKQT43|at|--11 HCP and 1 point for the quality heart suit. That, combined with 8 cards in hearts and spades makes the hand technically a Rule of 20 opener. However, it is a marginal opener at best, so I think pass in 1st and 2nd seat is fine.|

pc|S4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lead back the @S4. When leading back partner's suit, you lead back "^*Bremaining count^*N." Since East has a doubleton remaining East leads high-low. If East had 3 spades remaining, East would lead their lowest spade. This is very important if you want to improve your side's defense.|

at|^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|you have a problem. It turns out, at trick 8, you can throw a diamond and keep clubs and spades. But you don't know that. That is why as declarer you should run your winners. Because often the defenders discard incorrectly because they are not sure what cards declarer has remaining.|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is a good example of why I don't like quantitative 4NT. Many players would play 4NT by West over 2@H is quantitative. That makes it impossible for West to bid RKCB. So I play 4NT over 2@H is RKCB for hearts. Here, we play 4N as RKCB.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, when hearts are trump you can "have your cake and eat it too" so to speak. Because you can play "kickback" where 4@S is RKCB and then 4N is still quantitative. But let's not worry about that here.  Also, that obviously doesn't apply if spades were trump.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is rare you want to bid a grand slam unless you can count 13 tricks. Let's count tricks assuming East has the @HQ, which you don't know yet. But if East has the @HQ you can count 3 spades, 2 clubs, and 2 diamonds for sure.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have at least 4 hearts. If you can ruff 2 clubs in your hand or East might have the @SJ or @DQ you have 13 tricks. So if you wanted to be daring you could do the ^*bQueen Ask^*N  |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*g:queenask::Slam Bidding,(LINK  -  Queen Ask)^*N|CP||FP||at|  and if East has the @HQ then bid 7.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However 7 on a 3-2 break (68%) is marginal at best. That is the minimum percentage for bidding a grand slam. Bid 5@S as a Queen ask. You don't want to bid 7 missing the @HQ.|mb|5S|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East bids 6@H without the @HQ. With the @HQ if East has an outside K, they bid the suit with the king. But in this case East has the @HQ without an outside king so East bids 5N.|mb|5N|
