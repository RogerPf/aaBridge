nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding. East has an interesting problem over 2@H. The question is, should 3@S be preemptive or not over 2@H. I think most people would play 3@S as preemptive. But it really should not be.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no point. If you had a preempt, all you are doing is talking the opponents into bidding 4@H. So, if I were sure partner would understand that 3@S showed a very nice hand that's what I would bid. But in real life, I wouldn't be sure and would have to start with 2@S as East did.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed that West should double. Basically you double 3 level contracts when you have good trump. That's more important than HCP. East is pretty sure of 3 trump tricks. 2 at worst. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And partner has to have 2 tricks at least, possibly 3. Another reason to double is West knows East has a heart void and is, therefore, likely to compete over 3@H and West does not really want East to bid again.|
