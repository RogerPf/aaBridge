up|33|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good contract. Hard to say whether we should bid 5@H. Particularly at equal and unfavorable vul, 5 over 5 is wrong more often than not. As it turns out, in 5@H, we lose 2 clubs and a spade (assuming they don't find their spade ruff, which they might) for down 1.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if West leads a spade we will go down 2. Losing a spade, a spade ruff, and 2 clubs. So down 2 doubled (assuming we are even doubled) is better than their making which shows that 5 level decisions are among the hardest in bridge.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On another point, North has 11 dummy points--8 HCP, 2 doubletons, and a 5 card suit. So, instead of 3@H, North could bid 3@D as a limit raise.  I then would bid 4@H and not sure if West would bid 5@D.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is also a slightly better way to play the hand. Declarer should unblock the @CK and then lead a diamond. That way, if clubs are 4-1 the hand will still make. On this hand it turned out not to matter but it might. And there is no reason not to unblock clubs first.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general you should try and unblock suits ASAP. Sometimes you draw trump first but on this hand, since trumps are the dummy entries it is important to unblock clubs.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it was bid, it is a very hard hand to play because of the misfit and the fact that both have minimal HCP.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should have opened 1@C and then bid spades twice. That way partner could better judge what to bid. With 6-5 in general, you open your 6 card suit. Sometimes, if your 6 card suit is below your 5 card suit and your 5 card suit is not spades then you might open your 5 card suit to prevent your having to reverse.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on this hand West has a clear 1@C opener because West can then bid and rebid spades to show the 6-5 distribution. Then East will have a much better idea how to bid. On the other hand, once West opens 1@S, West has to live with 3NT the way the auction proceeded. 5@C is not likely to make and 3N might.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So after wining this trick, I am going to assume West has the spade king and try and ruff 3 spades, take 7 diamonds, 3 spade ruffs, and the @SA. Perhaps I will make 6 if the @SK comes down or I can induce East to play a club--the club ace.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 6 was an okay contract, although it goes down on a trump lead. And although most players would not lead a diamond because partner bid hearts there is a case to be made for a trump lead by West.|

UP|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Turns out this is fine because they have a diamond fit and can easily make a partial in diamonds. Perhaps West should West bid 2@D over 1N. You do want to declare if possible with 5-5 hands so I would bid 2@D. However, there is some risk, especially vul. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with weak diamonds I think pass is reasonable as well. And the @CK is probably not worth a lot. Although it happens to be helpful on this hand because East has the @CQ. The point is, be aggressive with 5-5 hands.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, regardless of what North does, East is bidding 3@D. So it turns out not to matter. But it is an important principle to consider especially when you have a marginal bid. However, "How is the auction likely to go and can I handle it if it goes that way?" should always be considered.|
