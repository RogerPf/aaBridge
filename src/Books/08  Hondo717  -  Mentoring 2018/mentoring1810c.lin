^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the auction first. 2@D over 1@H is fine and so is 2@H. Then West should be thinking about game with 14 HCP such as 3NT. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid something other than 3@D figuring 14 opposite at least 10 must have plays if partner has a heart stopper. I probably just bid 3@H. The 3@H bid asks partner to bid 3N with a heart stopper. So East does bid 3N. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure 3N makes since West only has 8 tricks, assuming a heart lead, 5 diamonds, 2 spades and a heart. I would run the diamonds and take the spade finesse hoping the @SJ is my 9th trick. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Turns out it loses and you go down 2. But it is at a 50% contract which is a reasonable game to be in. 5@D does have the same plays as it turns out. But there are rarely hands where 5 of a minor is a better contract than 3N. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And also, I am not sure that West should bid 5@D over 4@D. The problem is 3@D was an under bid. So now West is trying to make up for the original underbid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well you have to get over that. You can even play NT with a void if partner has stoppers.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Responses over 2@C is one of the few areas where Marty Bergen and I disagree. He prefers playing a 2@H response to 2@C as showing a bust hand. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But that makes it somewhat harder to bid some hands although in this case it wouldn't matter. Because if playing 2@H as bust the auction would go as follows:|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C-2@D-2N by me then North would bid 4@D as Texas transfer to hearts. And over 4@H would bid 4N RKCB. And North bids 7 when she found out we had all the key cards. So it works out the same. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main problem is when the 2@C bidder's suit is hearts because then the auction starts 2@C-2@H (bust), now the contract ends up getting wrong sided because the 2@C bidder has to now bid 3@H over 2@H.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer playing 3@C as the way to show the bust hand as the 2nd rebid. If it starts 2@C-2@D-2@H or 2@S the 2@D bidder now bids 3@C that shows a bust and no support for partner's suit.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a bust and support for partner's suit, the 2@D bidder jumps to 4 of partner's suit. That is weaker than raising the suit to the 3 level. If it starts 2@C-2@D-2@H-3@H for example that shows slam interest. This is another illustration of the principle of "fast arrival."|

nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I pass, I think West should bid 2@S especially with such a nice suit. However, I am going to interfere and throw a monkey wrench into the auction. Marty Bergen feels that you should try and interferer when you can with the opponents strong auctions.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


mb|3c?|nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And partner needs to understand that you are often bidding with distribution and not much strength (e.g. you have a preempt even if you don't jump).

^*BMovie Maker^*n: During the live session, Howard discussed several points which generated more interest than usual. Therefore, we are changing our usual pattern so we can thoroughly illustrate his points. Afterward, we will present this board as usual.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not a big fan of "opening light in 3rd seat at the 1-level although many are. I find it makes it hard for partner to bid constructively when he doesn't know whether or not you have a real opener.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I love to make aggressive preempts in 3rd seat. Here is a good rule to follow when opening in 3rd seat. It turns out, after 2 passes, on average, the 2 passed hands hold 16 HCP which means that 3rd seat and 4th seat hold 24 HCP between them on average.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you subtract your HCP in 3rd seat from 24, you know approximately how many HCP 4th. seat is likely to have. Here assuming East is going to pass, I would subtract my 6 HCP from 24 and figure that West has about 18 HCP on average.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would want to make it as difficult as possible for the opponents. Therefore, despite only having five so-so hearts I would open a weak 2@H bid in 3rd. seat.|MB|2H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, in 3rd. seat you should be very aggressive when preempting. Open Weak-Twos with a 5-card suit when you have a singleton or void. And when not vul (especially against vul opponents) preempt 1 higher than you might otherwise.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Experts call this approach "^*BWARIB^*n" which stands for "White Against Red Isn't Bridge." That comes from the old fashioned duplicate bridge boards holding the cards. |

nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There were white and red slots on each side. You were not vulnerable if the white slots were on your side. You were vulnerable if the red slots were on your side. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, neither were vulnerable when only white slots were showing and conversely both were vulnerable when they were facing the red slots.|

nt|^b@2^z@3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway what WARIB basically means is you should be very aggressive when preempting if not vul against vul-white slots are on your side and red slots (vulnerable) are on the oppoents' side.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After East opened 1@D, as you see I have diamonds and not a great hand. Therefore, I will reluctantly pass but I hate passing with 5-5 hands. Moreover, at unfavorable vulnerability (I am vul, they are not) with East announcing she has 1 of my suits I have to pass.|mb|p|

^*BKib^*n: Should your Weak-2 in 3rd seat contain Honors?|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a 5-card suit, you probably want at least one honor. But with a 6+ card suit, it is not nearly as important.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the best bid. 1-4-4-4 hands are always hard to bid and often you have no 100% correct bid. This is a rare case where rebidding 1NT with a singleton (always in spades) is the best although imperfect bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, North should consider doubling. However, the danger in doubling is it might cause declarer to know about the bad break and play trump differently. But whenever you have 4 or 5 trump and they get to game doubling is often a good idea especially in Matchpoints.|
