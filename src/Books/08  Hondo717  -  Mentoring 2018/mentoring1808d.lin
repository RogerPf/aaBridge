up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not really fair to West, since I did instruct North on how to defend. Nad I not said anything, West would have easily made the hand. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West done some planning, she might have made the hand. Assuming spades break normally, West can count 5 spade tricks and 2 diamond tricks needing a club trick. With 2 entries to dummy, it is almost certain West can take 1 club tricks because she can lead a low club towards her @CJ.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If that loses to the @CQ and she can get back to dummy (which she can't on this hand) she can lead another low club and hope I have the @CA. As long as I have 1 club honor it will make.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, since West only has 1 club entry she has to lead a low club towards her hand and guess which club to play. On this hand, since I hold both the @CA and @CQ it doesn't matter. Plus some inexperienced defenders might play the @CA 2nd hand high, incorrectly. But if I correctly play low, West has to guess which to play.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally would play the @CJ hoping South started with the @CQ. It is more likely North holds the @CA because North opened. But regardless of which club West plays, she is guaranteed 1 club for her 8th trick.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BEast:^*N If she plays the 9 of clubs and lets it ride and you play low it wins.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's not a particularly good play although it happens to work. Playing that way is only right if I hold both the @CQ and @C10. Whereas leading low to the @CJ is right if I have the @CQ regardless of who has the @C10.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, in real life, West probably makes 2@S because it would be easy to mis-defend.|

mb|P|mb|1H|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good pass by West. Some players think they must bid with an opening hand and will incorrectly make a takeout double with bad shape if they don't have anything else to bid. That is not a good policy. With 15 or so, you do need to find a bid. But with 12 to a bad 14 pass is fine.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 14 Starting Points--11 HCP, 1 quality suit point (hearts), and 2 length points. Then I can add 4 points for void because I have 4 trump giving me 18 Dummy points. That is enough to invite game at least.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is technically the right bid. But I actually think with the void and nice 6 card suit my hand is worth more than 18. So, I would override bergen evaluation and bid 4@S.|mb|4S|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think it is a pretty useless convention. Tell them one of your teachers strongly recommends against Flannery because 
a) weak 2 diamonds comes up much more than hands with 4 spades and 5 hearts.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


at|^^^^And  despite what you hear, a weak 2 diamonds is a perfectly good preempt and 
b) the only problem hand is 4-5-2-2 when partner bids 1NT over 1@H that hardly every comes up.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, if it does, just bid 2@C. I believe there is no reason to play Flannery for hands that come up once a year and can be handled reasonably effectively anyway. Now back to this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just use rule of 20. It's a matter of style. But I think in general bidding is better than passing.|

mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are missing 1 key card. You need to do the queen ask because if West doesn't have the @SQ you want to stop in 5.  The way to ask is to bid the next higher suit after the RKCB response (5@D on this hand over 5@C).^*g:queenask::Slam Bidding, (LINK  -  Queen Ask)^*n|at|.|

mb|5D|mb|P|mb|6C|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should only bid 6 with 5 key cards or 4 key cards and the trump queen. If West doesn't have the @SQ he would bid 5@S. If he does (as on this hand), he bids his cheapest king. So, here, West bids 6@C to show the @SQ and @CK. 6@S by West would show the @SQ and no outside kings.|
