^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend playing systems on after interference over 1NT. So 2@H is a spade transfer. Double would be a "stolen bid" double meaning that, had South not bid, West was intending to bid 2@D as a transfer.|

up|35|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is a reasonable contract. A little unlucky it went down. Let me make 2 other points about the bidding.

^C@2a)  If I were West I would have bid a Texas 4@H rather than 2@H. East gets credit for bringing this to my attention.
 
^C@2b)  West can "re-transfer" to spades after I doubled 3@H.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By redoubling East ends up as declarer making it more difficult for us to defend because I can't lead a red suit. Regardless, I suspect it's still down 1 because the @CQ is offside and partner will lead a diamond.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West's double showed exactly 4 spades and since East opened 1@C, she only has 4 spades very probably. So that, combined with the vulnerability, maybe, should dissuade me from bidding 5@H.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One minor point on the declarer play once she draws 3 rounds of trump. If West keeps track of the club spots, at trick 8, she can play a club to the 9 based on the first trick, where I played the @CJ. |

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She is just about certain North has the @C10 because if I had both the @CJ and @C10, I would have played the @C10 (lowest of equals) and then she could throw a diamond on the @CQ.|

^c@2 a)  It is unlikely North has a singleton club and 
 b)  Even if she does, she is out of trump or else has a natural trump trick. In either case it can't hurt.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players would bid 2@D. I don"t hate the bid, given the favorable vul. But usually you should have a better suit. You can be very frisky with 1-level overcalls, doing them on 8 points with not such a great suit.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even with opening points, such as North has here, you should be very cautious over-calling at the 2-level with a weak 5-card suit. Opening points in and of themselves do not justify a 2-level overcall with a weak suit.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So declarer, at trick 2, should lead a low heart from her hand immediately and hope North ducks. Then you need to draw trump ASAP hope that North has @hAxx and ducks the first heart. |
