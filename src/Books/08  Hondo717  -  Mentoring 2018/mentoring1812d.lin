PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perhaps in 2nd seat when vul, I might pass with a weak suit and flattish distribution (6-3-3-2). Otherwise, I highly recommend you preempt whenever possible. The plusses far outweigh the minuses.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on this hand, if North passes, I end up opening 1@S and we could end up in a lot of trouble.

UP|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let me discuss the 3@C opener. West is obviously too strong to open 3@C in 1st or 2nd seat. But in 3rd seat, you should often preempt, especially in a minor, when you have an opener and a long suit because the chances that you have game are small. And you make it much harder for the opponents to bid.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once partner is a passed hand, you are no longer preempting them. So the 3@C bid was a good tactic in 3rd seat.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My next comment is to address whether North should make a takeout double of 3@C.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I wouldn't hate a takeout double of 3@C, but the hand is pretty weak for a takeout double at the 3 level. The 4-4 in the majors is nice. But the flat distribution is bad, the @CQ is probably worthless, I am a passed hand, and we are vul.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So for all of those reasons I like the pass. If I were not a passed hand the decision would be harder.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The next question is should East raise to 4@C. If I were not a passed hand, I think so, especially given the favorable vul despite holding a flat hand. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should assume a 10-card fit (although sometimes, particularly in 3rd seat with clubs) it might be a 9-card fit. But here I think pass is fine since I was a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, I thought my 3@H bid was okay given my nice hearts.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


at|^^
^B@2^*BA Kib^*n: Howard, if East passes, don't you have a balancing double?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question about the balancing double. I could. But I have such nice hearts that I liked 3@H better. It is possible that spades (or rarely diamonds) is better. But more often hearts will be our best spot and I want a heart lead if EW end up buying the contract.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However if you chose to double with my hand, I would not say you were wrong particularly since there is at least a small possibility that North has club length and will pass for penalties.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now should North raise to 4@H?|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT| I don't think so. If you look at the NS hands, most of the time we will lose 3 diamonds and a club. The @DAK being onside is unusual, especially given the preempt. So I think North made 2 excellent decisions to pass.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me mention North's first play in spades. This is a fairly common position. At trick four, North must duck the first spade trick. By playing the @SA, North forced East to find the correct play of finessing the @SJ. However if North ducked the first spade then East might think I have the @SA particularly since I made a negative double.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North ducks the first spade then East may very well play the hand incorrectly because East may assume that I have the @SA particularly given my negative double showing spades.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, whenever the KQ is on the board and you hold the ace. It is almost always right to duck the first trick in that suit. The only exception being if it is the setting trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now back to the power of distribution. EW only have 20 HCP yet they made 5 because of their great distribution and fit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You really have to train yourself to not just rely on HCP. Bergen Hand Evaluation is the best way to do that. But even if you don't learn Bergen Hand  Evaluation, you MUST learn to love good distribution.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, East's 10 HCP hand is worth a lot more than a flat hand with 13 or 14 HCP. A 6-3-3-1 is nice distribution, In fact any hand with a singleton or void is wonderful.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth:^*N So I should assume you have hearts?|

pg| ***** 111 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No undo. You chose to bid 2@H. You have to live with your decision. It was not a horrible bid. You have a 5 card quality suit and a singleton and not Vul. It might not work out but that doesn't make it a bad bid.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you bid aggressively very occasionally (and I do mean rarely) you might go for a big number. But most of the time you will come out ahead. Even on this hand, it is not going to be horrible.|

lb|*yIs D3 by South a good lead?^^N|


cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Often a singleton is a good lead. But when you have natural trump tricks leading a singleton is not a good idea. You want to score natural tricks.|

up|45|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NShouldn't one have close to an opening bid to come into a live auction at the two-level?|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not necessarily especially not vul. You want to make a lead directing bid when you can. So although 2@H didn't work out it was still a reasonable bid particularly considering that most expert pairs would not be able to make a penalty double with my hand.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They would consider a double by me as just showing some extra values and not penalty.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib^*n: North almost has a Bergen opener. Is it best not to open because HCP are not in long suits?|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North doesn't quite have a rule of 20 or a Bergen Rule of 20 opener. Make the diamond @DAKQx, then you ca add one points for the a quality suit and you have a Bergen opener.|

UP|40|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So pretty normal result. My only comment is on the bidding. If you play support doubles and I recommend you do then East's 2@S bid promises 4 spades because with 3 spades East can make a support double over 2@C.|
