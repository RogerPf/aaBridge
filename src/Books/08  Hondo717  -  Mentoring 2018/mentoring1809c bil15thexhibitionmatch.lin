ht|d|va|4|CP||fp||at|^b@2On September 12, 2018, in honor of the BIL 15th Birthday Celebration, |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/,Howard Schutzman (Hondo717)^*N|FP||CP||at|, a bridge teacher and a bridge expert held a special "Listen To The Experts" session in place of his regular teaching session. 
|n^|7|at|
He played an exhibition match with three of his BBO expert friends. Howard partnered with his longtime partner wally1 (Marty), competing against Cheesy (Larr) and GolfPattee (Allen). They played a spirited IMPs match of 8 boards with many interesting deals. 
|n^|7|at|
Both partnerships play the weak NT which was of great interest to the kibitizers. The players all demonstrated the aggressive bidding style favored by Howard with many preempts, competitive auctions, and bids to close games and slams. 
|n^|7|at|
This movie, by Kia (nome), AKA Movie Maker, documents the hands that were played as well as the kibitzers' questions and the answers and comments by the players.|

Wally and I play 10-13, 
cheesy and golfpattee (Allen) play 11-14. 
We play standard carding, odd even discards. Leads are 4th best in NT, 3rd best from an even number, low from odd.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He didn't want to lead the 10 as it might be important. On the other hand, he didn't want to lead low as that implies an honor so the 8 was his choice. With 986 he would have led the 9.|

PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a void in clubs I wanted to put pressure on them. Just as East did on the first hand, rather than bidding a simple 1@S I thought 2@S would make it harder for them to bid. And it did especially after Wally bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bgolfpattee: ^*N|cp||at|I had a tough bid over partner's 5@C.  Wally made a great bid putting pressure on us.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BA Kib:^*N What is the 3 heart bid by West?|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is natural and forcing. Another bid West might have chosen is 3N.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bgolfpattee: ^*N|cp||at|I did consider bidding 3NT, but thought we risked missing a great fit in hearts.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And West's dilemma (bid 3@H or 3N) illustrates why you should preempt.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That comment is reasonable but as it turns out 6@C is not much worse than 5@C and golfpattee knew there was a spade lead coming and partner would get to pitch some losers.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The comment means don't bid slam unless you are pretty sure it is making. If we talked the opponents out of slam (e.g. we "fixed them") so be it. That is one theory of bidding. With that we are going to start board three.|

up|31|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bgolfpattee: ^*N|cp||at|I think my partner missed a bid. My pass of 5@C gives him the option of doubling or bidding 5@H.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. there is the concept of a "forcing pass." If your side voluntarily bids game and the opponents sacrifice you should not let them play undoubled. Golfpattee meant his bid as a "forcing pass", although it was not 100% clear in that situation.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He was telling pard he was willing to play in their suit because he had shortness in clubs and giving partner a choice of doubling 5@C or bidding 5@H.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Golfpattee didn't think partner was allowed to pass. The concept of "forcing pass" is quite complex.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bgolfpattee: ^*N|cp||at|As Hondo is explaining, I was leaving it up to partner. He can not pass in this situation, but alas he did.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bcheesy: ^*N|cp||at|I blinked...). Golfpattee made a forcing Pass... I undid his plan.....which is not Good Bridge: "stay on plan with your Partner."|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally would have thought it was a forcing pass. But Cheesy obviously did not. Sometimes the 4H bid might be a preempt preventing us from bidding 5@C but not in this hand I don't think.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We got lucky on this hand because Cheesy did not realize his partner made a forcing pass. However, in retrospect, I made a tactical error in the bidding. I should have bid 5@C immediately over the 3@D bid. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That puts a lot of pressure on the opponents. West now is not sure what to do. Had I done that, there is a good chance we get to play 5@C undoubled without being lucky. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The basic principle is that you should jam the opponents bidding and make it hard for them to communicate. By passing 3@D, I made it easier for EW to evaluate what they had and come up with a better decision as to how to bid. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I bid 5@C right away, then EW would have had a much harder time deciding what to do. Let us move on to the next board.|

pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWhy do you prefer Weak NT to strong, 15-17, NT?|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NDo you bid a Weak NT even if holding a five card major?|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BA Kib:^*N If you are too strong to open a Weak NT, according to your card, with a flat hand (e.g. 4,3,3,3) would you open a four card Major or would you still open 1NT?|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me briefly explain why why we play the Weak NT. We do so for the same reason everyone likes to preempt. 1NT is not only a precise bid, it is also preemptive. Further, we get to open 1NT a lot more than 15-17 players. That makes it harder for our opponents to bid as they have to come in at the 2 level.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let me describe it a little bit more. In general, the conventions are the same as when you play strong NT e.g. transfers, Stayman, etc. It is just that the ranges for responder are a higher.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, an invitational hand over strong NT is 9 whereas it is 12 for Weak NT. Further, there are some "gadgets" that you should play. One "gadget" is how to handle doubles of Weak NT. We play "DONT runouts."|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people think it is effective to double a Weak NT but because of our runout system that is not true because we rarely go for a big number. Let me explain it at a separate table.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East/West play transfer overcalls over Weak NT--partnership agreement.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically it is a way of playing natural overcalls with some additional flexibility. Because partner cant pass your transfer overcall. Partner accepts the transfer with a hand where he would have passed your natural overcall. And otherwise can make whatever bid he would have made if he was going to bid over a natural overcall.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And the additional advantage is the overcaller has another chance to bid. So, for example, he can bid a 2nd suit with a strong 2 suited hand. In summary, the transfer overcall gives you more flexibility in the bidding than a natural overcall.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding Lebensohl, many players use systems on after interference over their 1NT openers, However, over a strong NT, there is, more often than not, not much interference.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general you should prefer to open 1@C rather than 1@D even if you play strong NT because it gives partner more flexibility to bid. Over 1@D, with no major, he has to bid 1N but over 1@C he can rebid 1@D and I can rebid 1NT.|

ht|b|fp|1|CP|1|at|^bOpening Hand With 4 Diamonds and 4 Clubs|
ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some players advocate always opening 1@D when you hold 4 diamonds and 4 clubs. It is possible that I said that somewhere a while ago. However, here is my current thinking about how to handle such hands:|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

When you hold an opening hand with 4 diamonds and 4 clubs, some players advocate that you should open 1@D. However, there is no reason to arbitrarily do that and there is a good reason to prefer opening 1@C. If you open 1@D and responder has a weak hand with no 4-card major, he must respond 1NT. That is usually not desirable. It is often better for opener to be declarer at 1NT. Since the defenders now know that responder/declarer has no 4-card major, they will often lead a major. And opener will often have a holding (such as Kxx or AJx) where it would be better if a lead in that suit comes into opener rather than through opener. Additionally, if opener has better clubs than diamonds, if their side ends up defending with partner on lead, it would be better if partner knows to lead a club rather than a diamond.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

Whenever you open 1@C, partner has the additional bid of 1@D available as a response. In fact, because I think 1NT is an undesirable response with a weak hand, I (along with many experts) play that a 1NT response to 1@C shows 8-10. It is true that occasionally responder will have a 6 or 7 point hand with 4 clubs and 3 cards in the other 3 suits. In that case, I play that responder can (and should) bid 1@D. So, in theory, responder might only have 3 diamonds when responding 1@D to 1@C, but in real life that rarely occurs. And when it does occur, it does not usually lead to any bidding problems with the subsequent auction.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

So, whenever I am 4-4 in the minors I tend to open 1@C. The only time I open 1@D is when my diamonds are much better than my clubs and I want partner to lead a diamond if he is on opening lead.|
