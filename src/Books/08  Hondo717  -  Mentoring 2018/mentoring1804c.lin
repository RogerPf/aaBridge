mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would also bid 2@D with East's hand. In Match Points, I might venture 1NT. But in IMPs 2@D is likely to be safer.|

sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is time for me to plan our attack. Partner led the @S7 and the @S5 is missing. Partner could have started with @S75 and East with @SKQ10. West likely did not start with @SK107 because with AQ of hearts and @SK would have raised spades. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is does partner have a natural trump trick. So I am going to cash the @CA and get out with a spade. That way, if partner has a singleton spade we beat it regardless.|

In my opinion, there is no gap. Either your hand is strong enough to open 1@S or you should open 2@S. There is no such thing as a hand that is not strong enough to open 1@S and too strong to open 2@S.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are other factors we need to consider whether to bid 1@S or 2@S. My hand does not meet the Rule 20 to bid 1@S if you just use normal HCP. However, if you use Bergen Hand evaluation 1@S is the bid to make.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using "adjusted HCP" the hand has 10 HCP plus 1 point for the quality spade suit. So it is 11 "points" meaning it meets the Rule of 20.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand,there is a case to be made for opening 2@S given favorable vulnerability. Further, had I been 6-3-2-2 I would open 2@S. But 6-3-3-1 is much better distribution making my hand stronger.
So all considered I think 1@S is the slightly better bid but 2@S could work out.|mb|1S|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|mb|1N?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should make a bid. Double is quite reasonable for takeout as he was intending to make. However, let me discuss "Delayed DONT" convention that I play with my expert partners. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is used to compete over any 1NT bid by the opponents and not just opening 1NT--you can make a DONT bid over any 1NT bid. For example East with his hand could bid 2@C, showing clubs and another suit--delayed DONT. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there are some restrictions. The "other suit" cannot be a 5-card suit bid by the opponents. Therefore, here if he bids 2@C, his "other suit" must be either hearts or diamonds and not spades. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, say I had opened 1@C, partner over-called 1@H, responder bid 1NT, and if East then bids 2@D, that would show diamonds and spades because he can't have hearts as he would have raised to 2@H. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Aside from that restriction, if you play Delayed DONT, it is just a DONT bid. BTW, double is a 1 suited hand. So let's try that.|

mb|2D|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West does not have 3 clubs so she bids 2@D, which East will pass since he has diamonds. If he did not have diamonds, he would correct to 2@H.|

pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With partner promising 6-9 points we have 24-27 combined. In Match Points I probably pass. My general philosophy is to be conservative with 8 card  and aggressive with 9 card fits. |

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in IMPs it pays to stretch for games, especially vul games. So I would make a game try.|mb|3D|

pc|CK|sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count winners and losers first. This is a hard hand to analyze. The @CK is a favorable lead. It means I can get rid of a heart loser. Based on that lead (assuming West started with the @CKQ I can count 2 clubs, 1 heart, and 3 diamonds for sure. |
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I need 4 more tricks. If spades are 3-2 and East has the @SA, I have 4 spade tricks. Therefore, I end up losing 1 club, 1 spade and 1 diamond (maybe).|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


sk||nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2mcannon: Because of the bidding would you lead a heart from my hand?|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would lead a club from the West hand. Leading from a doubleton is often a bad lead. But it happens to work here. However, it is not recommended in general especially with no trump trick.|

pc|C9|pc|C2|pc|C4|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I ducked on first trick because West is marked with the @CQ and I can finesse the clubs.|

pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West did mis-discard. Had West thought about it the @HK is out and the @H10 is not a winner and can be discarded. Defense is very hard and often defenders mis-discard.|

mb|p?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of the time if it goes 1N-2@D, with 3 diamonds playing DONT, you should pass. And I have three diamonds. |
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I know North has either hearts or spades along with diamonds. But I do not know for sure which one. He could have 4 diamonds and a 5-card major--either hearts or spades. |
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I have 3 hearts and 4 spades it is quite possible that we might have a major suit fit which is better. That is when partner has 5 hearts and/or 4 or 5 spades. |
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if North has 5 diamonds and 4 hearts then we have 8 card diamond fit which is better than our 7 card heart fit though have nice hearts. If so then pass would be what I should do. |
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And finally if I bid 2@H then North can pass with 4 hearts or correct to 2@S if North has 5 diamond and 4/5 spades. With all those in mind I will bid 2@H.|
