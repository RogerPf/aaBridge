a) you don't have the distribution and 
b) You don't have the points. With that distribution, if you had enough points to reverse, you would have opened 1NT.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a hard hand to evaluate. Presumably we have an 8 card fit in spades at least since North should have 2 (or possibly 3) spades. I have 10 HCP and 2 length points. But I don't like my club void.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 5 spade tricks (if spades break 3-2), 4 heart tricks, assuming the finesse works, and a diamond. That's 10. If the @DA is onside, I might make 11. So I am going to draw 2 rounds of trump ending in dummy and lead a diamond.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I want to end in dummy is to have enough entries for diamond finesse. If East has the @DA, I need 2 entries to dummy to play diamonds. And if West ducks the @HQ, I only have 2 entries. The @SK and a heart.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And now we have to guess what to do since I have about what partner expects. But with a flat hand and no long suit, I have to pass although I am worried. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a little more I could double which would not be pure penalty. It simply would say "partner I have some values" and "do something intelligent."|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But given partner's balancing double (where partner could be relatively weak) I think pass is best. Although if you doubled I would not say that was wrong.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2joseye: Why is it balancing and not take out?|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a takeout double, but it was done in balancing seat (the pass out seat). So you might not have a full opener.|mb|P|

up|37|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@S worked out well particularly since we didn't double. In hearts or diamonds we lose 1 spade and 1 diamond for sure. We probably lose a heart since, on the auction, East is more likely to be short in hearts meaning I would finesse against West and lose. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So we can make 4@H at best and 4@S undoubled down 2 is a great result for EW.|
