mb|P3d|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should bid 2N or 3@D. My choice would have been 2N but 3@D is fine also.|

pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I suggest those interested in playing Kickback RKCB start with heart as trumps where 4@S is RKCB for hearts. So in an auction where hearts is established as trump suit, 4@S rather than 4N is RKCB. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can also play Kickback RKCB for the minors where 4@D is Kickback RKCB when clubs is the trump suit and 4@H is Kickback RKCB when diamonds is the trump suit. And finally, 4N is Kickback RKCB when trump is spades.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I could bid 4@H as RKCB for diamonds despite the fact that I bid hearts.|mb|4H|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We will play 0314 scheme for responses. First you have to think "STEPS." As you know in 0314 scheme there are four STEPS. The cheapest bid after the Kickback RKCB bid is the first step. And each STEP conveys the following information about the number of Keycards. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^eSTEP 1 is showing 0 or three Keycards.
^eSTEP 2 is 1 or 4 Keycards
^eSTEP 3 is 2 Keycards with no queen of trump
^eSTEP 4 is 2 Keycards with the queen of trump.|

mb|4N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In our example, North has one Keycards, STEP 2, and 4N is the correct response. With 0 or three Keycards, STEP 1, he had to bid 4@S. With 2 Keycards and no trump queen, STEP 3, he had to bid 5@C. And finally, with two Keycards, STEP 4, the bid would have been 5@D.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I can do the queen ask by bidding 5@C which shows another advantage of Kickback RKCB.

up|24|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think North's play was reasonable. Unfortunately, it did not work on this layout. The bidding was reasonable. The contract was so-so. And although I think 3@D was reasonable, let me discuss why North might consider 2N instead.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 reasons. The less important reason (although still valid) is that the quality of North's diamond suit is a little weak for a 3@D bid with only 1 honor. And the more important reason why I have a preference for 2N is the following:|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North knows South does not have a club stopper and without diamonds, 3@D is going to give South a problem bid. South is never going to be able to bid 3N lacking a club stopper. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of the considerations that some (although not all) experts use is to try and make the auction as easy as possible for partner. That is very important to me. That is why, when I have a choice of bids, I choose the bid that gives partner the least amount of difficulty and why I would have chosen 2N.|
