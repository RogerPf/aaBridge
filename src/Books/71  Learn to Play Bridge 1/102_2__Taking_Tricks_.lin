^-{ Introduction to the ^*bTrick^*n }
^-|fp||at|
Bridge is a game of taking ^*b tricks^*n . You may have played other card games (Hearts, Whist, Spades, and Euchre for example) where tricks play a central role. If you have played these games, then you already have some experience with taking tricks and learning bridge will be a snap for you.

Even if you are not an experienced card player, the concept of the trick in bridge is an easy one to master. Let's open a bridge deal and look at a trick.|

Are you ready ?     When you click   { ^*b Flow > ^*n }  below   you will see a trick being played. ^^ ^^|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|1hppp|wt|s|
pc|ha|pc|hj|pc|h2|pc|h3|sb|nNice work partner! You won your first trick!|
at|There you have it  -  your first bridge trick.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|
cs|1|at|
So what exactly is a trick ?

^-{  A trick consists of each of the 4 players playing a single card.  }^^|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When you are really playing bridge the act of playing a card to a trick involves placing that card face up in the middle of the table.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
Since each player is dealt 13 cards in bridge and each player plays 1 card to each trick, there are 13 tricks in the
play of the cards of every bridge deal. Bridge literature refers to these tricks as trick 1, trick 2, ..., trick 13.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
As you can see above, South was the winner of this trick. South won this trick because South played the highest of the 4 cards in the trick (the @HA). Remember Aces are the highest cards in bridge.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Unlike some other trick-taking card games, winning lots of tricks in bridge is considered a good thing to do. For now we will assume that the goal of every bridge deal is to win as many tricks as possible. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You will soon see that this approach is not always strictly correct at bridge. For the purposes of learning, however, assume for now that the object of bridge is to win as many tricks as you can.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Always remember that bridge is a partnership game. The tricks that you and your partner win are added together. As such, you should not be battling your partner to win tricks - work together with your partner to try to win as many combined tricks as you can.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Now let's back up and have a closer look at the trick we just saw.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


sb|n|
nt|^z@3^b@2|up||up||up||up||
nt|^z@3^b@2
OK - all the cards have been restored to their proper hands.  Move forward as normal and we will examine the same
trick card by card.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|tc|s|pc|ha|
nt|^z@3^b@2
The trick begins with South leading the @HA. We will get to the rules about which player is allowed to lead to a given
trick in a moment. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Once a trick has been started the other 3 players get a chance to contribute a card to the trick. The rotation always follows clockwise around the table.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Therefore West, the next player after South in this clockwise rotation, gets to play next to this trick.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hj|
nt|^z@3^b@2
West's contribution to the trick is the @HJ. Do you see anything strange about that?|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
After all, the @HJ is the 4th highest heart, but it cannot possibly win this trick as the @HA has already been played. Wouldn't West be better off to play a low card (like the @S2 for example) to this trick rather than ^*Iwaste^*N the @HJ?|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
Well, West would prefer to have been able to play a lower card on this trick, but one of the very most important rules of bridge is:
^-{You must always ^*Ifollow suit^*N to a trick if you are able to.}|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sb|wI hate to waste a Jack, but I must follow suit!|sb|e
Bummer partner!|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Following suit means that if you have any cards in the suit that was led to a trick, you must play one of those cards to that trick. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since hearts were originally led to this trick (by South) and West was dealt a heart (the @HJ), the rules of bridge force him to play it on this trick.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|sb|w|sb|e|sb|nHmmm... I've got a choice of hearts to play to this trick.|
nt|^z@3^b@2
North, who is the next player clockwise after West, now gets his chance to play a card to this trick. North must also follow suit (that is, he must play a heart). |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Unlike poor West who was dealt just one heart, North has 4 hearts he can choose from for this trick.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


sb|n|pc|h2|
nt|^b@2
North, who knows he cannot possibly beat the @HA, reasonably chooses to play his lowest heart, the @H2, on this trick.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North shouldn't be disappointed that he can't win this trick. In fact he should be pleased - he can see that his partner's @HA is certain to win the trick.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


sb|eMy turn to play, at last!|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East is the only player who hasn't played a card to this trick yet. Conveniently, he is also the next player after North in the clockwise rotation. East too must follow suit and he has 3 hearts to choose from.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


sb|e|
nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h3|
nt|^z@3^b@2
East (who also knows he cannot win this trick) wisely contributes his lowest heart, the @H3.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The trick is now complete as each of the 4 players has played a card. South wins the trick because his card, the @HA, ranks higher than any of the other 3 cards in the trick (the @HJ, @H2, and @H3).|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Watch what happens after a trick is completed in bridge.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|tc|r|
nt|^z@3^b@2
The 4 cards from the completed trick are collected together and the resulting pile of cards is placed on the side of the bridge table. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In a little while you will learn the proper way to organize your piles of played tricks so that it is easy to see how many
tricks each partnership has won.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In this program you can move your mouse over the pile of played tricks to review the cards from previous tricks (try it). |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Do not get too dependent on this feature, however, as you are not allowed to review past tricks when you are really playing bridge!|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
Now that trick 1 is complete, it is time to go on to trick 2 (remember, each bridge deal has 13 tricks in all). |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Who gets to play first to trick 2?|CS|1|AT|

^-{The player who wins a trick earns the right to lead the first card to the next trick.}^^|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since South won trick 1, he will be the leader to trick 2. The play of the cards will continue in this manner until all 13 tricks (and all 52 cards) are played out. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You may be wondering, "How is it decided which player gets to make the opening lead (that is, the first card in trick 1)?"|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Recall that every bridge deal contains 2 main phases, the bidding and the play of the cards. Our current study of
tricks is part of the play of the cards. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The opening leader (the player that leads to trick 1), however, is determined in the bidding. Bidding is presented much later in this program. Until that time you will just be told which player is the opening leader.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's continue with the play of this deal. Something interesting happens in trick 2. South, having won the first trick, is the leader to the second trick. The @HA worked well at trick 1. Suppose South decides to try the @HK as his lead to trick 2.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


pc|hk|sb|wI have no hearts left so I cannot follow suit!|
nt|^z@3^b@2
It is West's turn to play a card. We have already learned that a player must follow suit to a trick if he can. West was dealt only one heart, however, and he played that card (the @HJ) to trick 1. West is now out of hearts. What can he play?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
The answer is that West can play any card he chooses.

^-{If a player is unable to follow suit to a trick he can play ^*Iany^*N of his remaining cards.}|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


sb|wSo I must make a discard...|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Bridge players use the word discard to describe the play of a card that is made when a player is unable to follow suit.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West, who has no hearts left, must make a discard. Any thoughts as to what a reasonable discard might be?|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


sb|wI have so many cards to choose from. Help!|
nt|^z@3^b@2
West has a big choice to make as he is allowed to play any of his 12 remaining cards.|sb|wHow about this for a discard? This should win trick 2...|pc|sa|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Did you think that perhaps West should discard the @SA in an attempt to win trick 2? After all, we have already learned that the Ace is the highest card in bridge.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


sb|wOh... Perhaps I have erred.|
nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
In fact, you have been misled (sorry) as there is something important you have not learned about tricks yet:

^-{A discard cannot win a trick. 
The card that wins a trick is the highest card in the suit that was led.}|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


sb|w|
nt|^z@3^b@2
In a little while you will learn that there are times in bridge when a discard can in fact win a trick - when a trump suit is involved. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We won't be talking about trump suits for a while, however, so for now the rule you just learned is a solid one: 
^^^ddiscards can't win tricks.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In fact, it would be a very poor play for West to discard the @SA. West has no chance to win this trick and the @SA is West's best card. It should be saved for winning a future trick.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


sb|wCan I take it back please?|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's be good sports and let West take back his mistake. Don't get too used to this - you won't be able to take back your mistakes in a real bridge game!|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|sb|wThanks! But I still don't know what to play!|up||at|
So now that you know that West cannot possibly win this trick, do you have any thoughts on what would make a reasonable discard?|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Well, West has plenty of low cards in both spades and diamonds. Getting rid of one of those low cards seems like a sound idea, doesn't it?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|sb|wThis time I will discard my lowest card.|pc|s2|at|
Suppose that West chooses to discard his @S2. It is now North's turn to play. North still has some hearts left so he must follow suit.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|sb|w|sb|nLooks like you are going to win another trick, partner!|pc|h4|
at|^^North logically chooses to play his lowest heart, the @H4.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East now gets to play a card to complete the second trick. East, with 2 hearts left, must also follow suit.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


sb|n|
nt|^z@3^b@2|tc|h|pc|h5|sb|eYou are a natural at bridge, South!|
nt|^z@3^b@2
East also chooses to follow suit with his lowest heart, the @H5. South just won his second trick in a row!|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Just like with trick 1, the contents of trick 2 will be collected in a pile that will be stored at the edge of the bridge table.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


sb|e|tc|r|
nt|^z@3^b@2
The play of the cards will continue in this manner until all 13 tricks are played out. The deal will then be finished. The score will be entered (you will learn how to keep score later), the cards shuffled and dealt, and a brand new deal will be played.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You can keep playing bridge deals forever and each one is unique!|

nt|^z@3^b@2
One of the best ways to learn about tricks is to study combinations of cards to see how the play will go. Have a look at the spades in the above diagram, for example. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Each player has 3 cards so there will be 3 tricks in total. South is on lead. How many tricks will each partnership win?|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South was fortunate to have been dealt the 3 highest spades. So he will win all 3 tricks. 

Watch...|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s6|at|
The @SA is the biggest spade there is. South therefore wins the first trick.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|pc|st|pc|s3|pc|s7|at|
Once the @SA is gone (having been played to trick 1), the @SK is the highest remaining spade in the deck. South therefore wins trick 2 as well.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|pc|sj|pc|s4|pc|s8|sb|wRats, I was hoping to win a trick with that Jack!|
at|
With the @SA and @SK already played, the @SQ becomes the master card in that suit. West has saved his @SJ as long as possible in the hope of winning a trick with it. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It was a good try by West, but South's spades were just too strong. East and West could do nothing but sit there and follow suit.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||cs|3|at|



What we just saw is that this card combination:
^-{|ih|ps432|at|}
{|ih|psakq|at|}
^-
is worth 3 tricks for the North-South partnership (not that North contributed much).

In the above notation, the upper card holding (the @S432) belongs to North while the lower holding (the @SAKQ) belongs to South. Try to get used to this notation as you will see it a great deal in your study of tricks.

Also make sure that you understand that the suit being spades in this example is purely arbitrary.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|at|



^C{|ih|ps432|at|} ^I{|ih|ph432|at|} ^O{|ih|pc432|at|} ^U{|ih|pd432|at|}
^^|n^|d|at|^C{|ih|pSakq|at|} ^I{|ih|phakq|at|} ^O{|ih|pcakq|at|} ^U{|ih|pdakq|at|}

Each of the above 4 combinations is exactly the same as far as trick-winning purposes go. They will each produce 3 tricks for North-South. We will continue to use the spade suit in our examples, but do not be misled by this. For trick-winning purposes each of the 4 suits in bridge are the same.

You will eventually learn that there is sometimes a particular suit, the trump suit, that is considerably more powerful than the other suits. As we look at various card combinations, however, the actual suit being used is never important.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|n#|5|at|

Suppose we take the card combination we have been examining:|
ht|b|at|


^F{|ih|ps432|at|} 
^F{|ih|psAKQ|at|}|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


ht|f|at|^J And turn it upside down:|ht|b|at|


^R{|ih|pSakq|at|} 
^R{|ih|ps432|at|}
Now North has the 3 top spades and he will win 3 tricks in the suit. For partnership purposes, however, nothing changes. The North-South partnership will win 3 tricks with either of the above combinations.

In the first combination South will win all 3 tricks and in the second combination North will win all 3 tricks. Since North and South are pooling their tricks together, it amounts to the same thing - 3 tricks for North-South.|
cs|1|at|
^-
{For partnership trick-winning purposes, card combinations
do not change when you turn them upside down.}
^-|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|n#|5|at|

Going back to the original combination:

|ht|b|at|


^F{|ih|ps432|at|} 
^F{|ih|psAKQ|at|}|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


ht|f|at|^J   Let's add some cards:|ht|b|at|


^R{|ih|pS5432|at|} 
^R{|ih|psakqj|at|}|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


at|
Since each hand has 4 cards there will now be 4 tricks. How many of the 4 tricks will North-South win?|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|

Hopefully, you came up with the correct answer: the combination on the right will produce 4 tricks for the North-South partnership.

The presence of the @SJ is a welcome addition to South's spade holding. The @SJ is the 4th highest spade after the
@SA, @SK, and @SQ. South will use those 3 cards to win the first 3 tricks. 

The @SJ will be left as the highest remaining spade and will thus win trick 4. Regardless of the cards that East and West were dealt they will be powerless to prevent South from winning all 4 tricks from this combination.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|n#|5|at|

Returning once more to the combination we started with:|
ht|b|at|

^R{|ih|psakq|at|}

Now North has just 1 spade so he will only be able to follow suit once. It is a high spade, the @S10, but it should not cause North any pain to use this card - his partner is in the process of winning 3 tricks.

North will be forced to discard on the second and third tricks. Presumably North will have some low cards in other suits that he can discard as South is playing his spades.|

The lesson to be learned from the last few examples can be summed up as follows:

^-{Whenever one player is dealt only the highest cards in a suit he
will always win 1 trick for every card he was dealt in that suit.}

The above solid suits are worth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tricks respectively.

Solid suits are a joy to hold as you cannot help but win tricks in such suits. Before we go on to look at some suits that are less solid, there is one more important lesson to be learned from the combination that we started with.|

South has saved his best spade for last. The @SA will obviously win trick 3 and South will have won the same 3 tricks as when he played his spades from the top (@SA then @SK then @SQ). The order in which South plays his spades does not matter.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||cs|3|at|


The fact that with:

^-{|ih|psakq|at|}
^-South can play his spades in any order to the same effect is very important to understand. In this combination the @SA, @SK, and @SQ are all considered to be equals as far as trick-winning goes.

The @SA and the @SK are said to be touching cards as there are no other cards that rank between the Ace and the King. The same goes for the @SK and the @SQ - they are touching cards.|
cs|1|at|

The principle of equal cards can be summed up as:

^-{Whenever a player is dealt 2 or more touching cards in the same suit it does
not matter for trick-taking purposes the order in which he plays these cards.}

Be careful, however. Holding the Ace, King, and Queen of a suit does not always guarantee 3 tricks for the partnership. Consider this card combination:

^-{|ih|psQJ|at|}^^{|ih|psAK|at|}
^-North-South actually hold the 4 highest spades (the @SA, @SK, @SQ, and @SJ) between their 2 hands, yet only 2 tricks are available.

The reason is easy to see. Both North and South were dealt just 2 cards in spades. North will have no choice but to waste his @SQ and @SJ under South's @SA and @SK. What a shame! North might as well hold the @S32 instead of
the @SQJ.|

As this example shows, low cards can (and frequently do) take tricks in bridge. In order for them to do so, however, all of the higher cards must be gone first. Here the @S2 becomes the highest spade after 3 rounds of the suit are played.|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In this example, South is able to exhaust all of the East-West spades higher than his @S2 because he has the 3 top spades (the @SA, @SK, and @SQ) and because neither defender has more than 3 spades. That will not always be the case when North and South are dealt this combination of cards.|

All 13 spades in the deck are accounted for above so there is no way to give out any more spades to East or West. We can rearrange their spades slightly, however, and things are quite different for North-South's trick-taking prospects. Suppose we give West one of his partner's spades...|

So make sure you appreciate the @s5, @s4, and @s3 in the left combination just as much as the @S2. The @s2 is the only small card that (with some luck) can win a trick, but the other 3 small cards are vital as well.|

Here is another example of a card combination in which North-South can develop extra tricks by losing a trick. In this combination, however, the extra tricks that are established will be in the form of high cards (as opposed to low cards in a long suit as in the previous combination).|

nt|^z@3^b@2
It is not really that mysterious when you think about it. There are only 2 cards higher than the @SQ and @SJ - the @SA

The net effect is that the @SQ and @SJ are promoted to the 2 highest cards in the suit.|

^-{  Review and Example 1  }
^-|fp||at|
Let's step back for a moment and put what we have learned about tricks and card combinations into its proper perspective in bridge:

|cs|4|at|^-{Every bridge deal has 2 phases - the bidding and the play of the cards.}

|cs|2|at|{The play of the cards consists of 13 tricks being played.}
^-
There are 4 suits in each bridge deal. When you are actually playing bridge you should be looking at each of the 4 suits as a card combination. By examining each suit for its trick-taking potential you will find it is much easier to win as many tricks as possible.

|
pg| ***** 236 ***** |


at|It is time we had a look at the entire play of the cards of a bridge deal. Before we do so, there are a few of important things you need to know about bridge:

|cs|3|at|^-{During the bidding one of the players is designated as the declarer.}

|cs|1|at|{The player sitting to the left of the declarer makes the opening lead.}

^-In the following example (and throughout this program), South will be the declarer. West, who is sitting to the left of South, will always lead to trick 1.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|sb|wI will lead the Jack of spades.|sb|s|pc|sj|at|
West's opening lead is the @SJ. Look at the above picture and you will see that something else has happened. Your partner, North, has placed all of his cards face up on the table! What's going on here? Does your partner think he is being sporting?|
pg| ***** 240 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|sb|w|sb|nI have to show my hand. I am the dummy!|
at|
In fact, your partner is playing by the rules. Here's a major rule of bridge:

^-{The partner of the declarer is designated as the dummy. The dummy places
his cards face up on the table immediately after the opening lead is made.}|
pg| ***** 241 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|sb|n|at|
The name dummy is not particularly flattering for North, but there is a good reason for it:

^-{The declarer is responsible for playing cards both for himself and for the dummy.}

^-The dummy just sits there while his partner, the declarer, plays his cards for him.|
pg| ***** 242 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
None of this means that you should feel hurt if the bidding makes you the dummy on a particular bridge deal. In fact, you will be the dummy on roughly a quarter of all the bridge deals you ever play! Remember, bridge is a partnership game. |
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Your partner will be in control of your cards when you are the dummy and he has your best interests at heart. Also, being dummy gives you a chance to take a break from the game for a few minutes.|
pg| ***** 244 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Depending on the type of bridge being played (social or competitive) and perhaps on the size of the bridge table, the declarer might actually pick up and play cards from dummy or instruct the dummy to do so instead.|
pg| ***** 245 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Most trick-taking games do not have a dummy. The presence of the dummy makes bridge easier to play. Being able to see the dummy allows declarer to know the combined assets of the partnership.|
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
As such the declarer is in a good position to study each of the 4 card combinations in the deal.|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


sk|w|
nt|^z@3^b@2
East and West also get to see the dummy. For example, as West, this is what you would see - your own cards and the dummy's cards. The declarer can see his partner's hand while East and West (known as the defenders) cannot see their partner's hands. |
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

The bad news is that South has not won a trick yet. The good news is that there is only 1 spade left. There were 13 spades to begin with and all 4 players have followed suit 3 times (accounting for 12 of the spades).|
pg| ***** 260 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|sb|wI saved the best spade for last!|pc|sa|at|
The last spade is the @SA and South must choose a discard from the dummy. As dummy has absolutely nothing of value, it does not matter what card South chooses.|
pg| ***** 261 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|sb|w|pc|d3|pc|c5|at|
Suppose that South chooses to discard the @D3 from the dummy. East discards the @c5 and South must find a discard from his hand. Any thoughts on the matter?|
pg| ***** 262 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South has plenty of high cards and it would be a bad idea to discard any of these. We already know that high cards tend to win tricks.|
pg| ***** 263 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South still has 4 low cards from which to choose his discard. One of these cards is clearly the best play. Do you know which card?|
pg| ***** 264 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d2|at|
South should discard the @D2, but not because it is South's lowest card.|
PG| ***** 265 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The reason that the @D2 is the best discard is that we have already seen how low cards in long suits can sometimes win tricks. As the North-South partnership has 9 hearts between them South's small hearts have great trick-winning potential.|
pg| ***** 266 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In fact, the North-South heart combination is identical to a card combination we have already studied. If South is lucky, all 5 of his hearts could win tricks. That's a good reason not to discard any of them!|
pg| ***** 267 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dq|at|
Fortunately, the defenders are out of spades. West leads the @DQ to trick 5.|
pg| ***** 268 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dk|at|
The dummy and North follow suit and South wins the trick with the @DK (the @DA would be just as good, of course, as the @DA and @DK are touching cards).|
pg| ***** 269 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South is finally on lead and he can play whatever suit he wants.|
PG| ***** 270 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Hearts clearly has the most potential for tricks so it makes sense to play that suit now. Also, we have seen that the heart combination will produce various numbers of tricks depending on how the 4 East-West hearts divide.|
pg| ***** 271 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It will help for South to know quickly how many tricks the hearts are worth.|
PG| ***** 272 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In addition, since the lead may have to be lost to develop heart tricks, it is a good idea for South to keep his high cards in diamonds and clubs. The last thing South needs is to create more trick winners for the defenders.|
pg| ***** 273 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|pc|hj|pc|h2|pc|h9|at|
Both defenders follow suit to the @HA, West with the @HJ and East with the @H9.|
pg| ***** 274 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hk|pc|hq|pc|h3|pc|ht|at|
Even better news is that both defenders follow suit to the @HK. The 4 outstanding hearts were divided 2-2 between the East-West hands. The defenders have no hearts left.|
PG| ***** 275 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That means that South's @H8, @H7, and @H6 will all win tricks. It was a good idea not to discard any of those small hearts!|
pg| ***** 276 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h8|pc|c9|pc|h4|pc|d7|at|
South might as well take his heart tricks immediately. Both defenders discard, as expected, on the third round of hearts. West parts with a club while East pitches a diamond. South wins trick 8 and continues the heart barrage.|
pg| ***** 277 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h7|pc|ct|pc|h5|pc|c6|at|
The @H7 wins trick 9 as both defenders discard clubs.|
pg| ***** 278 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h6|pc|cj|pc|c2|pc|c7|at|
When South plays his last heart he must choose a discard from the dummy. South selects the @C2 and both defenders also discard in clubs.|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There are only 3 cards left and South would like to win as many of those tricks as possible. The @DA is certain to win a trick, of course, but one of the defenders is still holding the @CA (they would never discard such a high card).|
PG| ***** 280 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Should South play the @DA or a club now?|
pg| ***** 281 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If you figured out that South should play a club now, you are going to be a whiz at bridge!|
PG| ***** 282 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Don't despair, however, if you thought the @DA was a better play - you're just learning. In order to see why it is better to play a club, let's look at all of the remaining cards.|
pg| ***** 283 ***** |

Suppose that South makes the mistake of winning a trick with his @DA immediately.|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|da|pc|dt|pc|d5|pc|d8|at|
South wins trick 11, as expected, but that will be the last trick that South wins. South has no choice but to play a club now.|
pg| ***** 285 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ck|pc|ca|pc|c3|pc|c8|at|
South leads the @CK to trick 12, but West is able to win the trick with his @CA.|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dj|pc|c4|pc|d9|pc|cq|at|
West is on lead to trick 13 and his last card is the @DJ. West leads that card and wins the last trick.|
pg| ***** 287 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South did not do badly on this deal. They won 7 of the 13 tricks while East-West won the other 6.|
PG| ***** 288 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South could have taken an eighth trick, however, if he had led a club at the critical point. Let's return to that point of the play.|
pg| ***** 289 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|at|
This was the position when South had to decide whether to play the @DA or a club. We have seen that if South plays the @DA it will be the last trick he wins. Let's see how a club works out.|
pg| ***** 290 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ck|pc|ca|pc|c3|pc|c8|at|
South's lead of the @CK forces out West's @CA and promotes the @CQ as the master card in the suit. South has lost 1 of the last 3 tricks, but he will win the 2 remaining tricks.|
pg| ***** 291 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dj|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|da|at|
West, with only diamonds left, is forced to lead that suit to South's @DA. It would not have mattered if West still had a club to lead at this point.|
PG| ***** 292 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is important to see that South's @DA did not ^*Igo away^*N even though South did not win a trick with that card when he had the chance to lead it earlier.|
pg| ***** 293 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South is on lead for trick 13 and his @CQ is going to win a well-deserved eighth trick for the North-South partnership.|

Let's have another quick look at the entire play of the cards of this deal, this time with all 52 cards in view.|
pg| ***** 296 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|at|
West's opening lead was the @SJ (he was showing off a bit as he could have led one of his higher spades with the same effect). North then put down his dummy.|
pg| ***** 297 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s2|at|
West's @SJ won the first trick.|
pg| ***** 298 ***** |

South wisely chose to discard the @D2 on the fourth round of spades.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dq|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dk|at|
West led the @DQ to trick 5 and South won the @DK.|
pg| ***** 302 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|pc|hj|pc|h2|pc|h9|at|
South cashed the @HA as both defenders followed.|
pg| ***** 303 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hk|pc|hq|pc|h3|pc|ht|at|
Both East and West also followed suit to the @HK. Hearts had divided 2-2 and all of South's small hearts were high.|
pg| ***** 304 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h8|pc|c9|pc|h4|pc|d7|at|
South played off his remaining hearts, forcing both defenders to make 3 discards.|

The critical point of the play had been reached.|
pg| ***** 307 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ck|pc|ca|pc|c3|pc|c8|at|
South led the @CK, driving out West's @CA and promoting the @CQ into a winner. |
PG| ***** 308 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have seen that South would have taken a trick less had he won a trick with the @DA at this point instead of playing a club.|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dj|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|da|at|

Here's the whole deal one more time. We will now examine each of the 4 suits in isolation, keeping in mind the card combinations we learned in this chapter.|
pg| ***** 313 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
As was mentioned, North-South's heart combination is identical to a card combination that we have already seen. |
PG| ***** 314 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We learned that this combination will win between 3 and 5 tricks depending on how the 4 outstanding hearts are divided between the East and West hands.|
pg| ***** 315 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal North-South are lucky that both East and West were dealt 2 hearts. As such, all 5 of South's hearts will win tricks. Had the hearts been split less favorably, North-South would not have been able to win so many tricks.|
pg| ***** 316 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Turning our attention to clubs, that suit is also very similar to a card combination we have seen. The North-South club holding will produce exactly 1 trick (by promotion), but the lead must be lost to the @CA first.|
pg| ***** 317 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The diamond suit is not a complete stranger to us either. Here the @DA and @DK are certain tricks. We have seen how low cards in long suits sometimes win tricks, but that is not going to happen in diamonds. Can you see why this is the case?|
pg| ***** 318 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South were dealt only 6 diamonds between the 2 hands. There are 7 diamonds outstanding. At least one defender is sure to hold enough diamonds to guard the third round of that suit. |
PG| ***** 319 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal both defenders have enough diamonds to guard the third round. There is no way that more than 2 diamonds tricks could ever be available for North-South.|
pg| ***** 320 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Finally, let's have a look at the spades. The North-South spades are unlike any of the card combinations that we have studied. |
PG| ***** 321 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North and South were each dealt 3 small spades. It should come as no surprise to you that the North-South partnership can never win any tricks with this card combination.|
pg| ***** 322 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If we look at the East-West spades, however, we will recognize an old friend. West's spades constitute a solid suit. We learned that a solid suit will win 1 trick for each card in the suit. |
PG| ***** 323 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since West has 4 spades he is able to win 4 tricks in that suit. That is exactly what we saw happen on the first 4 tricks of this deal.|
pg| ***** 324 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Our study of card combinations allows us to make some pretty accurate predictions about this deal. We know that North-South have exactly 2 diamond tricks and that 1 club trick can be built. |
PG| ***** 325 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Furthermore, since the East-West hearts are 2-2, we know 5 heart tricks are available. That's 8 tricks in all - exactly the number of tricks that South was able to win as declarer. South's 8 trick winners are hilited above.|
pg| ***** 326 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The other 5 tricks were all won by West. His solid spade suit was worth 4 tricks. The @CA is the only other card that won a trick for the defenders.|
pg| ***** 327 ***** |

Before we go on to study some new card combinations, let's review what we have learned from watching the play of the cards of an entire bridge deal. 

First of all, we have learned a great deal about the mechanics of the play of the cards in bridge:
|
pg| ***** 328 ***** |


at|
^-{The bidding determines which player will be the declarer.}
|
pg| ***** 329 ***** |


cs|2|at|
{The opening lead is made by the player to the left of the declarer.}
|
pg| ***** 330 ***** |


cs|3|at|
{The partner of the declarer will be the dummy. The dummy places
all of his cards face up on the table after the opening lead is made.}
|
pg| ***** 331 ***** |


cs|1|at|
{The declarer plays cards both from his own hand and from dummy.}
|
pg| ***** 332 ***** |


cs|4|at|
{The other 2 players (outside of the declarer and dummy) are called the defenders.}
|
pg| ***** 333 ***** |


at|
^-Every bridge deal you ever play will have these properties. All of this may seem overwhelming now, but it won't take long until the basic mechanics of the play of the cards at bridge seem second nature to you!|
pg| ***** 334 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|


This deal also provided some valuable insights into the strategies of playing the cards as declarer:
|
pg| ***** 335 ***** |


at|
^-{It is not always a good idea to win as many tricks as you can as quickly as
you can. High cards should sometimes be kept so that the lead can be regained.}
|
pg| ***** 336 ***** |


cs|2|at|
{It is generally a good idea for declarer to play on his long suits as early as 
possible in an attempt to start developing tricks with the low cards in those suits.}
|
pg| ***** 337 ***** |


cs|3|at|
{It is a good idea to discard cards that cannot possibly win tricks.}
|
pg| ***** 338 ***** |


cs|1|at|
{Studying card combinations makes it easier to make good decisions
as declarer. That's why we are going to continue studying them!}
|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


at|
^-You may have noticed that some of these suggestions are a little bit vague. Unfortunately there are very few ^*Iuniversal rules^*N in bridge. It is always possible to come up with a deal where a rule of strategy that has always served well does not apply.

That is one of the reasons why bridge is a difficult game - the words ^*Inever^*N and ^*Ialways^*N cannot really be applied to the strategies of play. This is also one of the reasons that bridge is such a great game. Every new deal of the cards can be looked at as a unique learning opportunity.

nt|^z@3^b@2
In this program, many of the bridge deals you see  WILL  look like that one.

The deal you NOW see above is not very realistic - it is extremely rare for so many touching cards to be dealt together.|
PG| ***** 342 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Another reason why this deal is not very realistic is that you could play bridge for many years and never be dealt a hand with as many high cards as South holds.|
pg| ***** 343 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Nonetheless, this type of deal makes it convenient to illustrate a point. You will see this sort of deal quite a bit in this program. |
PG| ***** 344 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When there are lots of solid suits it is easy to focus on the suit that is not solid (that's a hint).|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sq|at|
South wins trick 1 with the @SQ. The @SK or @SA would have done just as well, of course, as all 3 of those cards are equals. What do you think of North-South's trick-winning prospects?|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose we choose not to think about it and just start winning tricks with all of the high cards in the South hand.|

South has managed to take the first 9 tricks all by himself! Let's see how the last 4 tricks go.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cj|at|
Clubs is the only suit remaining in South's hand. The @CJ is led to trick 10.|

West's 3 remaining cards are the only cards left in their respective suits. West will win the last 3 tricks, holding South to his 9 top tricks, 3 in each of his 3 solid suits.|
pg| ***** 360 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|39|at|
Suppose we go back to trick 1 and think things out more carefully this time. It should come as no surprise that South can win 3 tricks in each of his 3 solid suits (spades, hearts, and diamonds) for a total of 9 tricks. How about a tenth trick?| 
pg| ***** 361 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Have a look at South's non-solid suit, his clubs. Is winning a club trick possible?|
PG| ***** 362 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
After the @CA, @CK, and @CQ, South has the next 4 highest clubs. We have already seen how the @CKQ or @CQJ10 might win a trick via promotion. Would you believe that @CJ1098 can be promoted into a winner as well?|
pg| ***** 363 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
One way to see this immediately is to think as follows: the @CJ will take out the @CA, then the @C10 will force the @CK, and finally the @C9 will take care of the @CQ. The @c8 will be left as the highest club in the deck and a tenth trick-winner for North-South.|
PG| ***** 364 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You still don't believe it is possible? Watch...|
pg| ***** 365 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sq|at|

West is out of clubs so he will have to discard on this trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|ck|at|
South has to give up the lead one more time to promote a club trick. He leads the @C9 and West discards the @D8 as East wins the @CK. As predicted, South's @C8 is the highest remaining club.|
pg| ***** 372 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
Did you notice that the @C8 is not the only eight in the deck that is the master card in its suit? West's @S8 is also a potential winner.|
PG| ***** 373 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Fortunately, East (and not West) is on lead. Moreover, South has all the other high cards in the deck so there is no way for West to gain the lead. West's @S8 will be left to rot!|
pg| ***** 374 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h5|at|
The card East chooses to lead now will not make a difference. Suppose East plays a heart.|
pg| ***** 375 ***** |

South wins East's heart return with the @HQ. Now it is time for a great moment in bridge...|

South triumphantly leads the @C8 out of his hand.|
pg| ***** 377 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d9|pc|c5|pc|c7|at|
West discards the @d9 while North and East both follow suit. All that hard work suddenly seems worthwhile when the @C8 wins the trick!|
pg| ***** 378 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have already won 5 tricks and South's 5 remaining cards are all certain to win tricks as well. By making clubs the focus of his attack, South is able to win 10 tricks - a trick more than he won when he played all of his solid suits first.|
pg| ***** 379 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||cs|3|n#|5|at|

So even when the Ace, King, and Queen of a suit are all missing:
|ht|a|n#|5|at|^-{|ih|pc5432|at|}
{|ih|pcjt98|at|}

^-it may be possible to win a trick (or tricks) by promotion.

|
pg| ***** 380 ***** |


at|Make sure you appreciate the ^*Iinternal solidity^*N of South's clubs. Each of the @CJ, @C10, @C9, and @C8 played a role in North-South winning their tenth trick on the deal we just saw. As with other promotion combinations, it would be just as good if these same clubs were divided in any other way between the North and South hands.

|
pg| ***** 381 ***** |


cs|1|at|The deal we just saw further illustrates another lesson we previously learned:

^-{It is not always the best strategy to win tricks as quickly as possible when you are the

ht|l|at|^-you may be surprised to learn that holding:
^-|ht|f|cs|3|at|^T{|ih|pc5432|at|}
^T{|ih|pc9876|at|}

may be enough to produce a trick. Notice that North-South's 8 cards represent the 8 lowest clubs in the deck. As such, it may strike you as remarkable that this combination could ever produce a trick. North-South do, in fact, need a little luck to come to a trick with this combination, but it is not a long shot. Can you see how this card combination could be worth a trick?

Enough hints already! Let's see how it works... This time we will play through the deal without looking at the East-West hands.|
PG| ***** 387 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South's hand is the same as his last one except that the clubs have been weakened. With a little bit of luck North-South can still win 10 tricks.|
pg| ***** 388 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|at|
West's opening lead is the @SJ and North lays down a familiar (and depressing) dummy.|
pg| ***** 389 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sq|at|
After winning trick 1 with the @SQ, South should begin his assault on the club suit. If you don't see how the North-South clubs could ever win a trick, you will see shortly.|
pg| ***** 390 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c6|pc|cq|pc|c2|pc|ct|at|
South leads a club from his hand. West's @CQ wins the trick as East follows suit with a fairly high club, the @C10.|
pg| ***** 391 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|st|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sk|at|
The defenders play a second round of spades, South winning the @SK.|
pg| ***** 392 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c7|pc|ca|pc|c3|pc|cj|at|
When South plays another club both defenders again play big enough clubs to win the trick. West's @CA wins the trick as East follows suit with the @CJ.|
pg| ***** 393 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sa|at|
South wins the spade continuation with the @SA.

Did you notice that the @CA, @CQ, @CJ, and @C10 have all been played? The only card that is standing between the @c9 and a trick is the @CK.|
pg| ***** 394 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c8|pc|h8|pc|c4|pc|ck|at|
West discards on the third round of clubs as East wins his @CK. It may seem strange, but your @C9 is going to win a trick!|
pg| ***** 395 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h5|pc|hq|pc|h9|pc|h2|at|
Evidently East is now out of spades. He returns a heart and South wins the @HQ.|
pg| ***** 396 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c9|pc|ht|pc|c5|pc|h6|at|
Yes, the @C9 really is worth a trick! Both defenders are out of clubs and have to discard.|
PG| ***** 397 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South has already won 5 tricks and he still has 5 certain winners in his hand. North-South come to 10 tricks in all, their 9 top tricks and the trick that was built in clubs.|
pg| ***** 398 ***** |

nt|^z@3^b@2
Have a look at all 52 cards and pay special attention to the club suit.|
PG| ***** 399 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Can you see why North-South were able to build a trick in clubs despite the fact that East and West were dealt the 5 highest clubs between them?|
pg| ***** 400 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||cs|3|n#|5|at|

Here, in isolation, is the club suit from the last deal:|
ht|a|at|^h|ih|pc9876,caq,c5432,ckjt|at|


North-South win a club trick because neither defender was dealt as many as 4 clubs. Once 3 rounds of clubs are played, East-West will have been forced to play all of their clubs. After 3 club tricks have been lost, North-South will be left with the only clubs in the deck (1 each). Once they regain the lead in another suit they will be able to win a trick in clubs.

|cs|1|at|^-{This is not an example of winning a trick by promoting high cards.
It is length, not strength, that wins a trick for North-South with this card combination.}|
pg| ***** 401 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||cs|3|ht|a|at|^b{|ih|pc9876,caq,c5432,ckjt|at|}
^^
North-South have 8 clubs, leaving East-West with 5 clubs. In the deal we have just seen (and in the diagram to the above left), the 5 East-West clubs are divided 3-2.

|
pg| ***** 402 ***** |


at|If the East-West clubs had been divided 4-1, North-South would not have been able to win a club trick. In the diagram to the right, East can follow suit to all 4 rounds of clubs. North-South do not have a length advantage over the defenders anymore and they cannot win a trick.

pg| ***** 410 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hq|at|
West leads the @HQ and North finally puts down a dummy with some assets! Not only does North have the @SK and @SQ, he has lots of small spades too. We have already seen how low cards in long suits can win tricks. How many tricks do you think North-South can win on this deal?|
pg| ***** 411 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If you answered, "all 13," then go to the head of the class! Outside of the spade suit, North-South have 6 certain tricks, the @HAK, the @DAK, and the @CAK.|
pg| ***** 412 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South also have 3 certain tricks in spades, the @SA, @SK, and @SQ. These cards are split between the 2 hands, but that shouldn't make a difference - there are still 3 easy spade tricks for the North-South partnership.|
pg| ***** 413 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That's still only 9 tricks in immediate winners. Where are the other 4 tricks going to come from?|
pg| ***** 414 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Dummy's 7-card spade suit is the answer. Once the @SA, @SK, and @SQ have all won tricks there will still be 4 small spades in the dummy. |
PG| ***** 415 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If both defenders are out of spades by this time, then all 4 of dummy's remaining small spades will win tricks. North-South will win all 13 tricks - 9 tricks in top cards and 4 tricks with small spades.|
pg| ***** 416 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The nicest thing about this plan is that it is probably going to work. There are 9 spades between the North and South hands leaving only 4 spades for East and West. |
PG| ***** 417 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Unless all 4 outstanding spades are with one defender (not very likely) the @SA, @SK, and @SQ will draw all of the outstanding spades. Dummy will be left with 4 extra spade winners.|
pg| ***** 418 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hk|at|
After winning the opening heart lead in his hand, South should focus his attention on his main source of tricks, the spade suit.|
pg| ***** 419 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When we were talking about card combinations you learned that, for trick-winning purposes, it doesn't matter which order the high cards are played.|
PG| ***** 420 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal it is very important which of the @SA, @SK, and @SQ are played first. Can you see which spade should win the next trick and why?|
pg| ***** 421 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|at|
The @SA is the only correct answer. First let's see how well this play works before exploring why the alternatives won't work.|
pg| ***** 422 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s8|at|
The @SA wins the first spade trick as both defenders follow suit. That is a very good sign. It means that neither defender was dealt all 4 outstanding spades. Dummy's entire suit will run.|
pg| ***** 423 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s2|pc|st|pc|sq|pc|h6|at|
South continues with the @S2 to dummy's @SQ (or @SK). East's discard should not be a cause for concern. West has just 1 spade left (he started with 3 spades and followed suit twice already). The @SK will take care of that spade.|
pg| ***** 424 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|sj|at|
As expected, East discards again on the @SK and West follows suit with the last remaining spade, the @SJ. South discards a small card, of course, saving his high cards to win future tricks. |
PG| ***** 425 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's just make sure all of those small spades are really good...|
pg| ***** 426 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|d2|pc|h9|at|
Sure enough, the @S7 wins the trick! The other 3 players are out of spades and are, thus, forced to discard.|
pg| ***** 427 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have won the first 5 tricks. There are still 3 winning spades in the dummy and 5 winning high cards in the South hand. That adds up to North-South winning all 13 tricks!|
PG| ***** 428 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We will now go back and see the result of South playing the wrong high spade at trick 2.|
pg| ***** 429 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|16|at|
The play has been returned to just after trick 1 (where South won the heart opening lead). |
PG| ***** 430 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We saw how South's leading the @SA to trick 2 results in North-South winning all 13 tricks. Let's see what happens if the @SK or @SQ wins the first spade trick instead.|
pg| ***** 431 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sq|pc|s8|at|
South leads the @S2 from his hand and wins the trick with the @SQ in the dummy. Both defenders follow as before, meaning dummy's small spades are going to be winners.|
pg| ***** 432 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is not much choice as far as the second spade trick goes. South has only 1 spade left. It is the @SA and South will have to play that card to the next trick.|
pg| ***** 433 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s3|pc|h6|pc|sa|pc|st|at|
The @s3 is led from the dummy and South wins the trick with the @SA as East discards.|
pg| ***** 434 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
OK - North's @SK will draw West's last spade and dummy will be left with 4 extra winning small spades. There is just one small problem...
|
pg| ***** 435 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{The lead is in the South hand and there is no way to give dummy the lead!!!}|
pg| ***** 436 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Dummy's spades are stranded. Everything would be fine if dummy had one of South's Aces or Kings - the lead could be transferred to the dummy in that suit.|
pg| ***** 437 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
As it is, the lead is locked in the South hand. North-South have won 3 tricks already and South still has 5 high card winners. That's only 8 tricks in total.|

|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Now 8 tricks may not sound so bad - after all it represents a clear majority of the 13 total tricks. Remember, however, that North-South could have won all 13 tricks with proper play.|
PG| ***** 439 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This huge (5 trick) difference is a direct result of South's play in the spade suit. The correct play results in 7 spade tricks while the incorrect play results in only 2 spade tricks.|

pg| ***** 444 ***** |


n#|8|at|When we were just thinking about card combinations, the order of winning tricks was not important - we could always say, "when North regains the lead he can win some tricks." In some real bridge deals there is no way for the hand with winning tricks to regain the lead. When this is the case, you have to be very careful with the order in which you win your tricks.|
pg| ***** 445 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|

Here is a good rule to use in order to help you avoid the pain of stranding your winning tricks. Remember that bridge is not very well suited to rules. The following rule is one of the soundest bridge rules of them all, but even it has exceptions on some deals.

|
pg| ***** 446 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{If a suit has unequal numbers of cards between the two hands,
you should win tricks with the high cards in the shorter hand first.}

^G{|ih|psQJT98|at|}|
ht|l|at|^LNorth has 3 cards and South has 5 cards, 
^Lan unequal number with North being the short hand. 

^LWin the first 2 tricks with the @SA and the @SK 
^L(the high cards in the short hand).

|
pg| ***** 448 ***** |


ht|t|at|If the @s2 is played to either the first or second trick, South will win that trick, but the suit will become messed up. The third trick will have to be won in the North hand, stranding 2 winning spades in the South hand.

Everything will still be OK if South can regain the lead in some other suit. If South has no way to regain the lead, however, he should pay attention to the above rule!|

We were fortunate enough to have been dealt 3 heart stoppers on this deal, but one of those was knocked out by the opening lead. We were left with 2 heart stoppers (and 2 club stoppers) so we could only afford to lose the lead twice (after that the defenders could win extra tricks). 

By losing the lead twice in diamonds (and never in spades), we were able to maximize the number of tricks that we were able to win.|
