qx|min,Responder's minimum rebids|
nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|5|fp|t|at|
^-{ Responder's minimum rebids }
^-|fp||at|
Your partner opens the bidding with 1 of a suit. You respond with a new suit bid, promising at least 6 total points and at least 4 cards in the suit named. Your partner rebids in another new suit and it is your turn to rebid. How do you make your decision?
|ht|h|cs|1|at|^-{|ia| 1cp1hp1sp?|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|The subject of responder's rebids is not a simple one. This is due to the fact that there are many ways the bidding can go before responder has a chance to take a second bid. Sometimes the opener will be limited, but sometimes he will not be. In the bidding above, for example, opener could have either a minimum (13-15) or a medium (16-18) hand.

One of the luxuries that responder has when choosing his rebid is that pass is usually an option. Almost all of opener's rebids (including his new suit rebid above) are non-forcing.

|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{Responder is usually allowed to pass at his turn to rebid, but he
should try to keep the bidding going if a game contract is still possible.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|In other words, the responder should only pass at his second turn if he knows that a game contract is impossible (and if he thinks the strain of opener's rebid should be reasonable).|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Just like the rebid of the opening bidder, the responder's rebid classifies his hand into 1 of 3 ranges, namely minimum, medium, or maximum. The total point ranges for these categories are different for the responder than the ranges we learned for the opener:

|cs|3|at|^-{Responder places his hand into one of these categories: minimum (6-9), medium (10-11),
or maximum (12 or more). Responder's rebid limits his hand to one of these 3 ranges.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


cs|1|at|There are some useful consequences of categorizing both the opener and the responder as either minimum, medium, or maximum:

^-{If opener has shown a minimum (13-15) hand, responder knows to signoff in a partial
if he is also minimum, invite game if he is medium, and force to game if he is maximum.}
^-
This should be easy to understand. Suppose opener's rebid promised a minimum hand (13-15 total points). If responder is also minimum, with 6-9 total points, he knows that the partnership cannot have the 25 combined total points for a game contract. He should try to sign off in the best strain at as low a level as possible.

If responder has a medium hand with 10 or 11 total points, he knows that game will be reasonable if opener is near the top of his 13-15 total point range. He can express this opinion by making an invitational rebid.

If responder has a maximum hand with 12 or more total points, he knows a game contract is certain as the partnership must have 25 or more combined total points. In this case, the responder must force to game with his rebid.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Here is what responder knows about the partnership's game prospects when the opener promises either a medium or a maximum hand with his rebid:
|cs|4|n#|8|at|^-{If opener has shown a medium (16-18) hand, responder will either signoff in a partial
or invite game if he is minimum, but will force to game if he is medium or maximum.}

|cs|2|at|{If opener has shown a maximum (19-21) hand, his rebid created a game force. Opener
will have promised enough combined total points for game even if responder is minimum.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|If the responder has a complete minimum with 6 total points he will know that game is out of reach opposite a medium (16-18) opening. With 7 or 8 total points the responder should invite game opposite a medium opener. 9 total points are enough for responder to force to game if opener is medium. Rebidding opposite a maximum opener is quite easy. In many cases a maximum opener will rebid the best game contract and responder can pass. 

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|Responder's most difficult rebidding decisions are when both his response and opener's rebid have been in new suits. Responder's task is difficult in this case because he does not yet know if the opener is minimum or medium.

|cs|1|at|^-{|ia| 1cp1hp1sp?|at|}

Our first examples of responder's rebid will be continuations after this difficult sequence of bids.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

|cs|2|ht|d|at|^C {By passing a non-forcing bid.}

cs|1|at|The following minimum rebid, when responder goes back to opener's first suit, is usually referred to as a preference (and not as a raise). We will see why in a moment.

at|^^Pass - do not rebid at all. This hand has only 6 total points (5 HCP and 1 long suit point). Game is out of reach even if partner is at the top of the medium range. Your hearts are not strong enough to rebid and you lack the diamond stopper that 1NT would suggest. Since you prefer spades to clubs you should pass 1@S and expect to be in a reasonable partial contract.|

at|^^Rebid 2@C, taking a preference back to opener's first bid suit. This hand is the same as the last one except that the spades and clubs have been switched. This time you prefer partner's first suit. Let him know that by taking preference to clubs. You are not showing any extra strength by taking a second bid. You are only saying that you like clubs better than spades and that your hand is unsuitable for any other minimum rebid.|

at|^^Rebid 2@H. This hand, with 8 total points, is stronger than the hands we just saw, but it is still well within the minimum (6-9) range. Responder should try to have at least 6 cards in his suit to bid it again, but a strong 5-card suit (such as this one) will do in a pinch. Responder really is in a pinch on this hand which lacks good support for both of partner's suits and does not have a diamond stopper for notrump. Fortunately, the strong 5-card heart suit comes to the rescue.|

at|^^Rebid 2@H again. This 6-card heart suit is not very strong, but any 6-card suit is strong enough for responder to bid twice. Do not rebid 1NT just because you have a diamond stopper. It is more important to show your extra length in hearts, a major suit.|

at|^^Rebid 1NT. This hand has 8 total points (all in HCP) which puts it in the minimum range. Having a stopper in the unbid suit (diamonds in this case) is one of the main requirements of responder's 1NT rebid. The other main requirement is the inability to raise partner or to bid the same suit a second time. This hand clearly meets all of the requirements for a 1NT rebid. The fact that this hand is balanced is a nice bonus.|

|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|^^Rebid 1NT again. Ideally this rebid should be used to show a balanced hand, but it is the only good choice with this unbalanced hand. The 5-card heart suit is not strong enough to bid a second time. You have a 5-card diamond suit that you have not shown yet, but 2@D (the last new suit) would not show a minimum hand. The good news is that you have a stopper in diamonds, the unbid suit.|

at|^^Raise to 2@S. At first it looks like you should pass this hand with 6 total points now that a trump fit has been found. Remember, since a raise is being considered, add 3 short suit points for the singleton diamond. Now this hand is worth 9 total points and 4@S should have a good chance if opener has a medium hand. Give him one last chance to tell you if he has any extra strength.

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


n#|8|at|^^Rebid 2@C, showing your preference for partner's first suit. This preference feels more like a raise as the hand contains 4-card support for clubs. Why don't the 3 short suit points for the singleton spade push this hand above the 6-9 total point range of minimum hands? The answer is that you should only count short suit points in unbid suits. Partner has bid spades so we shouldn't count anything for our singleton spade. This hand is still worth only 8 total points.|

Rebid 2@H. Any 6-card suit can be rebid by the responder and 2@H is the correct rebid with this minimum hand. This hand has the diamond stopper that a 1NT rebid would promise, but 2@H is a more sensible choice. This hand is unbalanced and rates to take several more tricks in hearts than it would in notrump.|

Pass. Your 5-card heart suit is far too weak to rebid and you lack the diamond stopper that 1NT would promise. You aren't crazy about either of partner's suits, but you do have more spades than clubs. With such a minimum hand it is best to keep the contract low and pass partner in 1@S.|

ht|c|cs|1|at|^O{|ia| 1cp1hp1sp1n|at|}


Rebid 1NT. This hand is close to the top of the minimum range. Opener could still have a medium (16-18 total point) hand so it is a good idea to take another bid. The hearts are too weak for 2@H and a 2@S raise would promise 4-card support. With a strong holding in diamonds, the unbid suit, 1NT is the correct rebid, even though this hand is unbalanced.|

ht|p|cs|1|at|^O{|ia| 1cp1hp1sp2c|at|}


Rebid 2@C, taking a preference back to opener's first suit. This is a very minimum response with no attractive rebid, but it would be wrong to pass now. You have a clear preference for clubs over spades. The heart suit is too weak for a 2@H rebid and the diamond suit is too weak for a 1NT rebid. Try 2@C and hope for the best.|

^-{ Responder's medium rebids }

A medium (10 or 11 total point) responder has 4 ways to invite a game contract:
|cs|1|ht|h|at|^B{|ia| 1cp1Hp1sp3c|at|} 
|cs|2|ht|f|at|^B    {By jump raising partner's first suit.}

|cs|2|ht|n|at|^Q   {By rebidding 2NT.}

|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ht|u|at|All 4 of responder's above rebids are non-forcing, but highly invitational. The opener can pass when responder makes one of these rebids, but he is encouraged to go on to a game contract with any semblance of extra strength.

|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{Responder's medium rebids show 10 or 11 total points. Opener will insist on game with 
15 or more total points, pass with 13 total points, and use his judgement with 14 total points.}

nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Here are some examples of responder's rebids with medium hands (10-11 total points):|

|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|^^Jump raise partner's first suit to 3@C (a jump preference). This hand has 10 total points, all in HCP. Remember that you should not count any short suit points for your singleton as partner has bid spades. You should try to have 4-card support for the jump preference of a minor suit, but 3-card support is acceptable if there are no good alternative rebids. 3-card support is sufficient for a jump preference in a major suit.|

|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|^^Jump raise partner's second suit to 3@S. This time the singleton is in an unbid suit so this hand counts 3 short suit points. 11 total points (8 HCP and 3 short suit points) is too much for the minimum rebid of 2@S. An invitational rebid is called for and our 4-card support for spades points to 3@S as the best choice. This hand also contains 4-card support for clubs, but raising a major suit takes priority over raising a minor suit.|

at|^^Rebid 3@H. The jump rebid of responder's suit suggests a medium hand with a strong 6-card (or longer) suit. This hand contains 11 total points (9 HCP and 2 long suit points). It is clearly a medium hand and the 6-card heart suit is strong enough for a jump rebid. 3@H is just right, both in terms of strength and in terms of hearts.|

at|^^Rebid 2NT, not 3@H. This 6-card heart suit is too weak for a jump rebid. Like most notrump bids that we have seen, only HCP are used to define responder's 2NT rebid. This rebid suggest 10-11 HCP and at least one stopper in the unbid suit (diamonds in this case).|

at|^^Rebid 3@C, a jump preference. This is the type of hand that was mentioned earlier where a jump preference is an acceptable rebid with only 3-card support for the minor suit that was opened. Make sure that you understand that this rebid is very much a least of evils decision.

This hand lacks the 4-card support that a jump raise of opener's second suit (3@S) would promise. The hearts are not right for a 3@H rebid and the diamond holding is too weak to consider a 2NT rebid. 3@C is not exactly comfortable either with only 3-card support for partner's minor. At least your 3 clubs are strong, which makes this rebid a little more appealing.|

When responder bids new suits at his first 2 turns he creates a game force. Responder can use this forcing rebid to help find the best game or to explore for slam.

As long as we are able to win the next 9 tricks, 3NT could easily succeed even without a diamond stopper.

The range of responder's 4@S rebid is around 12-14 total points. With any less he makes a medium rebid. With any more slam is still possible (as opener can have up to 18 total points). You should force to game with a new suit bid of 2@D and show your spade support later.|

at|The difference is that in the first sequence responder is limited to 12-14 total points. 12 total points are enough to ensure game even if opener has 13 total points. Furthermore, even if opener has 18 total points a small slam is not in the cards. This 4@S rebid is a signoff.

When responder has 4-card support and 15 or more total points, a small slam becomes a possibility. Responder can convey that message by rebidding in a new suit and supporting at his next opportunity. In the second sequence responder's third bid, 3@S, is forcing (because 2@D created a game force). This sequence promises 15 or more total points and suggests that 6@S may be the best contract if opener has extra values.

^^Opener's 1NT rebid describes a balanced hand without 4-card support for hearts (or the rebid would have been 2@H) and without 4 spades (or the rebid would have been 1@S). This weak unbalanced hand would like to get out of 1NT and into either 2@H or 2@D. Opener is sure to have 3-card support for one of these suits as he would not rebid 1NT with 2 doubletons.

It would be nice to rebid 2@D here, but we have learned that responder's rebid in a new suit creates a game force. This 8 total point hand (6 HCP and 2 long suit points) is not even worth a game invitation opposite a minimum opener, let alone a game force. What to do?

This hand has 12 HCP and 1 long suit point. That's enough to force to game even opposite the minimum opener that partner has shown. The big question is which game contract to play. If partner has 3 spades or 4 hearts then an 8-card major suit fit will be present and 4 of that major rates to be best. Otherwise 3NT should be a reasonable contract.

It would be nice to be able to make a forcing bid of 2@H here, but we just learned that this is one situation where a new suit by responder would be non-forcing. Care to guess at the solution to this problem?

pg| ***** 125 ***** |


at|^^Jump rebid to 3@H. A jump rebid in a new suit is a game force after opener rebids 1NT. If opener has 4-card support for hearts he will raise to 4@H (opener always needs 4-card support to raise responder's second suit). Otherwise, if opener has 3-card support for spades, he will show it now by bidding 3@S and you will go on to 4@S. If opener cannot support either major he will bid 3NT. What a great plan - you will always find an 8-card major suit fit if it exists!|

Rebid 3NT. With 13 HCP this hand is too strong for a 10-11 HCP 2NT rebid. This hand is just strong enough to insist on a game contract opposite partner's opening bid. 3NT is the best maximum rebid as this hand is balanced and contains a very strong holding in the unbid suit (diamonds).|

Rebid 4@H. This hand has 14 total points (11 HCP and 3 long suit points). A maximum rebid is called for and 4@H is the logical choice. Your heart suit is strong enough to be trump even if partner has a void in hearts. You know what the contract should be. Let partner in on your secret!|

Rebid 4@S. This hand is worth 14 total points (11 HCP and 3 short suit points). With a maximum hand you are responsible for ensuring that a game contract is reached. You know that 4@S should be the best game contract as there must be an 8-card major suit fit. The 33 combined total points that a small slam requires will not be present even if partner has a medium hand. 4@S is, therefore the correct rebid.|

Rebid 2@D. Again there are 14 total points (13 HCP and 1 long suit point). This time, however, we do not know which game contract rates to be best. Notrump is possible, but only if partner can help in diamonds. Hearts or clubs could also be right, depending on partner's distribution. You need more information and the only way to get it is with 2@D. This new suit rebid is artificial and forcing to game. Hopefully partner's third bid will help you select the best game contract.|

We have learned that 33 combined total points are usually enough for a small slam contract and that 37 combined total points will usually make a grand slam a good bet. Unfortunately, these magic numbers do not always work. Take this example:

|ht|h|cs|3|at|^C{|ih|pskqJt5hk87d6cAQ87|at|}|
ht|m|cs|3|at|^C{|ih|ps7haqjt43dkq7ckjt|at|}|

ht|n|at|^LSouth's 3@H rebid suggested a medium range hand
^Lwith a strong 6-card (or longer) heart suit. South has 18
^Ltotal points, 16 HCP and 2 long suit points, putting 
^Lhis hand at the top of the 16-18 medium range. North
^Lhas 18 total points when it comes to raising hearts,
^L15 HCP and 3 short suit points. Is there a slam?

|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


ht|u|at|Point count suggests that 6@H would be a reasonable rebid on the North hand. North with 18 total points expects a small slam to be best even if the opener is at the bottom end of the medium (16-18) range. Something goes horribly wrong, however, if North rebids 6@H.|

Let's have another look at the pair of hands we just saw and see how the Blackwood convention can be used to avoid a poor slam contract:

^Lfor slam, but he uses Blackwood 4NT just in case
^L2 Aces are missing. South shows just 1 Ace with his
^L5@D response and North signs off in 5@H, knowing
^Lthat 2 Aces are missing.

|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


at|The South hand has now been changed so that it contains the @DA instead of the @DK and @DQ. South now has 1 less HCP, but the extra Ace makes slam look very good. Now his response to Blackwood is 5@H. North knows that only 1 Ace is missing and carries on to a small slam.|

pg| ***** 149 ***** |


ht|w|at|South has now been given a third Ace, the @SA, in exchange for his @CK and @CJ. His response to Blackwood is 5@S. North's 7NT bid is more about counting tricks than counting points. North expects to win 13 tricks in notrump (5 spade tricks, 6 heart tricks, the @DA, and the @CA). Expecting to win the first 13 tricks without any ruffs is a good reason to bid 7NT!|

There is a lot to learn about the proper use of Blackwood, cuebids, and other slam bidding techniques. We will not go into much more detail about these subjects, but here are some tips to help you make the best use of these tools. We have seen some of these already:

|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{Blackwood should only be used when the 4NT bidder is confident that the partnership
has a control in each of the 4 suits. A control is an Ace, King, singleton, or void.}

|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


cs|2|at|{When you have slam interest, but cannot use Blackwood, try for slam by making a
cuebid. A cuebid is the bid of a side suit after the trump suit has already been agreed.}

|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


cs|1|at|{A cuebid promises a control in the suit bid. In most cases the first cuebid
in a suit should show first round control of that suit (the Ace or a void).}

|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


cs|3|at|{There are some times when it is fine to cuebid a second round control. In particular,
it is a good idea to cuebid a King in a suit your partner has bid (but not a singleton).}

|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


cs|4|at|{Do not use Blackwood if your hand contains a void. When you have a
void it will usually not help you to know how many Aces your partner has.}

|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


cs|2|at|{Remember, the 5NT King-ask can only take place if you have already used the 4NT Ace-ask.
Also, the 5NT King-ask is a grand slam try - it promises that the partnership has all 4 Aces.}

|
pg| ***** 184 ***** |


cs|1|at|{^*UIMPORTANT^*N: The player who uses Blackwood sets the contract.
The responder to Blackwood should never overrule his partner's signoff.}

n#|8|at|The quantitative raise of 1NT to 4NT is too important as a natural bid to give it up, even to a terrific convention like Blackwood. Fortunately, the Gerber convention comes to the rescue.

In all the bidding sequences we have seen, only 1 partnership has really been involved. Both members of the other partnership passed throughout the bidding. We use the term competitive bidding to describe sequences in which both partnerships are bidding (because the partnerships are then ^*Icompeting^*N for the contract). This section is all about competitive bidding.

{Even though some opening bids can be made on 3-card suits, overcalls show at least
5-card suits. 6-card length (or more) is preferred for an overcall at the 2-level (or higher).}

|

^-

pg| ***** 250 ***** |


at|The purpose of the preemptive jump overcall is the same as the purpose of a preemptive opening bid - to make the bidding as difficult as possible for the opposing partnership.

We have already seen that a partnership is often able to arrive at the best contract when the opponents keep passing. It is much harder to find the best contract when the opponents are in the bidding. Also, the higher the opponents bid the harder it gets for you and your partner.

|
pg| ***** 251 ***** |


at|When South makes a triple jump overcall on the above hand, he is completely aware of the fact that 4@S will probably fail. However, 4@S does not rate to fail by too much and it is likely that the opponents can succeed in some game or slam contract. 4@S will make it hard for them to find out where they belong. Making life hard for the opponents is what preempts are all about.|
pg| ***** 252 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Preemptive jump overcalls are almost exactly the same as preemptive opening bids. There is one other type of overcall to learn about and this overcall is also very similar to the opening bid that it corresponds to.|

ht|o|cs|2|at|^-{The only difference between a 1NT opening and a 1NT overcall is that the opening can be
made without regard to stoppers. The 1NT overcall promises a stopper in opener's suit.}
^-
Having a stopper in the opener's suit is a good idea when you overcall 1NT. There is a very good chance that the opening lead will be in the opener's suit (spades). If we didn't have a spade stopper the defenders would likely win the first several tricks.

|
pg| ***** 255 ***** |


at|Responding to partner's overcall is a complex subject that will not be covered in this program. Bear in mind, however, that you can do all the same things when your partner overcalls that you can do when he opens the bidding. You can pass, raise partner's suit, show a new suit of your own, or bid notrump. All of these responses to partner's overcall are similar in nature to the corresponding responses when partner opens.|

^-{ Takeout Doubles }
^-|fp||at|
The natural meaning of the double is to suggest that you think the opponents' contract will fail and that you want to maximize the number of penalty points available. In the earliest days of contract bridge an unknown pioneer of bidding theory came up with a brilliant concept:

|cs|2|at|^-{Use the double in some bidding sequences in this artificial sense -
the partner of the doubler should take out the double and bid his best suit.}

pg| ***** 295 ***** |


at|^^The answer is that South cannot bid ^*Ianything^*N, despite holding 16 HCP. A suit overcall would promise 5-card length and a 1NT overcall would promise a diamond stopper. A penalty double is a poor idea - South has no idea if he can defeat 1@D or not. It looks like South will have to pass despite his nice hand. Here's why passing with this strong of a hand is not very appealing:

The correct response is 2@D, the suit that East opened. This is not a natural bid - you are not suggesting that the
contract should be 2@D. This is an artificial bid used to show a strong hand that is unsure of the best strain. This hand needs more information from partner and bidding 2@D is the way to get that information.

^-
^^^^^^
The first hand is likely to win 5 tricks against a spade contract, 3 trump tricks and 2 Aces. The second hand is far richer in HCP, but is far less valuable in defense to a spade contract. The second hand has very few certain winners if spades are trump. Suppose for example that one opponent was dealt a singleton diamond and the other opponent was dealt a singleton heart. The opponents will be in a position to ruff some of your high cards and 4@S could easily succeed.

at|South's double is for takeout. It is South's first turn to bid, the opponents have bid only 1 suit, and neither North nor South has previously made a bid. All of the conditions for a takeout double have been satisfied. South must have a pretty strong hand for this takeout double as his partner will have to go to the 3-level in order to show his best suit.|

Overcall 1@H. You have good support for all of the unbid suits and enough strength to make a takeout double. It generally works out better, however, to overcall when such hands contain a 5-card major. If you double and your partner has 4 spades and 3 hearts he will respond in spades. The partnership will end up in a 7-card fit instead of an 8-card fit.|

Make a takeout double. This hand has 18 total points (17 HCP and 1 long suit point). That's just enough to start with a takeout double with the intention of bidding hearts next. The upper limit of an overcall is 17 total points.|

Make a takeout double. Your hand is strong enough for a 2-level overcall, but your diamonds are not. A 2@D overcall would normally be based on a 6-card suit, but a strong 5-card suit is also acceptable. This diamond suit just doesn't cut it. It would be nice if we had 4 spades (the unbid major suit) for our takeout double, but none of the alternatives are perfect either.|

ht|p|cs|1|at|^O{|ia|  1c1n|at|}



Overcall 1NT. Your support for all unbid suits is reasonable, but a 1NT overcall has the advantage of describing your entire hand in one bid. Partner will expect a balanced hand with strong clubs and 15-17 HCP. That's exactly what you have. If your clubs and diamonds were reversed then a takeout double would be correct.|

Respond 1@S. Do not pass just because you have a terrible hand! Partner is expecting you to choose one of the other 3 suits and you have a clear preference for spades, your only 4-card suit. Never pass partner's takeout double unless you have great length and strength in the opponent's suit.|

ht|p|cs|1|at|^O{|ia|1cdp1h|at|}



Respond 1@H. Your diamonds are better than your hearts, but hearts is a major suit while diamonds is a minor suit. Considering how bad your hand could be (see the hand at the top of the page), this hand is not bad at all. If partner is very strong, game is still possible and 4@H is your most likely game contract.|

Respond with a jump to 2NT. Your clubs are very strong, but you do not have enough of them to pass partner's takeout double. This hand was made for the 2NT response, which shows 11-12 HCP in a balanced hand with a strong holding in the opponent's suit.|

Respond with a jump to 2@D. With 10 total points (8 HCP and 2 long suit points) it is a good idea to take some kind of ^*Ipositive^*N sounding action. A jump in a suit in response to a takeout double suggests 9-11 total points and a nice suit. This hand certainly fits the bill.|

Respond 4@H, a jump to game. You have 13 total points (10 HCP and 3 long suit points). That's enough to insist upon game opposite a takeout double. Partner's takeout double promises either heart support or a very strong hand. In either case 4@H is very likely to be an excellent contract.|

Pass. This is the sort of hand you need to pass your partner's takeout double - great length and strength in the opponent's suit. This hand is very likely to win 5 trump tricks in a contract of 1@C. Partner can be counted on to win a few tricks with high cards so prospects are good that 1@C will be defeated, perhaps several tricks.|

Cuebid 2@C. With 14 total points (all in HCP) you must insist on some game contract. The problem is that you do not know which game contract to play. 4@S, 4@H, or 3NT could be right, depending on partner's distribution in the majors. The cuebid of 2@C is the way to get the information you need. If partner bids a major you will raise him to game. Otherwise you will bid 3NT at your next turn.|

Respond 1NT. This is a constructive bid, suggesting a balanced hand with 8-10 HCP and a strong holding in the opponent's suit. 1NT does a great job of describing your hand to your partner in one bid. The alternative of jumping to 2@D is not very attractive with such a poor 4-card suit.|
