^-{ Introduction to planning the play }
^-|fp||at|

Planning the play as declarer consists of 2 steps:

|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{^*UStep 1:^*N Decide how many tricks you would like to win between your hand and
the dummy. We will refer to this number of tricks as the goal.}

|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


cs|2|at|{^*UStep 2:^*N Decide on a sequence of plays that will give you
the best chance of achieving your goal.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|Up until now our goal has always been to win as many tricks as we possibly could. That's not the way it is when you are really playing bridge. On every bridge deal there is a specific number of tricks that the declarer should try to win.

|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{The declarer's objective is to achieve his trick-winning goal.}

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


cs|2|at|{The defenders' objective is to prevent declarer from achieving his trick-winning goal.}

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


cs|3|at|{The dummy's objective is to sit still and root for his partner, the declarer!}|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|at|
^-{The number of tricks that represent declarer's goal is determined in the bidding.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


cs|1|at|Even though we don't know much about the bidding yet, it is starting to become obvious that the bidding is a very important part of every bridge deal. We have already seen that the bidding determines:

^-{1. Who the declarer, dummy, and opening leader will be.}

|cs|2|at|{2. What declarer's trick-winning goal will be.}

|cs|3|at|{3. What the trump suit will be (or if the deal will be played in notrump).}
^-
|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|1|at|We will learn all about bidding in the next chapter, but this chapter is about planning the play as declarer. The first step of planning the play is easy:

^-{^*USTEP 1:^*N Identify the number of tricks you would like to win as declarer, your goal.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|When you are really playing bridge, you will know declarer's goal from the bidding (which takes place ^*Ibefore^*N the play of the cards). Since we have not learned about bidding yet, you will be told declarer's trick-winning goal in the deals that follow.

|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


cs|2|at|The second step of planning the play is the hard part and will be the subject of this chapter:

^-{^*USTEP 2:^*N Decide on a sequence of plays that will give you
the best chance of achieving your goal.}|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|n#|5|at|So after we identify our trick-winning goal as declarer, all that's left in planning the play is:
|n#|8|at|^-{^*USTEP 2:^*N Decide on a sequence of plays that will give you
the best chance of achieving your goal.}
^-
Unfortunately, the second step is easier said than done. How are we supposed to decide which play sequence gives us the best chance of fulfilling our goal? The good news is that the second step in planning the play can be broken down into 3 sub-steps. These sub-steps are different, depending on whether there is a trump suit or not.

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|Here are the 3 sub-steps for notrump deals:

|cs|1|at|^-{^*USTEP 2A:^*N Count the number of immediate winners between the declarer and the dummy.}

|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


cs|2|at|{^*USTEP 2B:^*N Figure out how many extra winners must be established to achieve the goal.}

|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


cs|3|at|{^*USTEP 2C:^*N Come up with the best plan you can for establishing enough extra winners.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|Here are the 3 sub-steps when there is a trump suit:

|cs|1|at|^-{^*USTEP 2A:^*N Count the number of losers in the declarer's hand.}

|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


cs|2|at|{^*USTEP 2B:^*N Figure out how many of these losers must be eliminated to achieve the goal.}

|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


cs|3|at|{^*USTEP 2C:^*N Come up with the best plan you can for eliminating enough losers.}|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
This is the central difference between planning the play when there is a trump suit and when the deal is played at notrump:

^-{At notrump declarer should think about establishing extra winners.}

|cs|2|at|{With a trump suit, declarer should think about eliminating losers.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|A careful declarer will consider both winners and losers on all deals, regardless of whether the deal contains a trump suit or is played at notrump. For the purposes of coming up with a sound plan for achieving your goal, however, thinking winners at notrump and losers when there is a trump suit is a great way to start.

|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{Think winners on notrump deals. Think losers on trump suit deals.
Remembering this principle will make it much easier for you to plan the play.}
^-
|at|We will now have a look at several bridge deals, some with a trump suit and some in notrump. In each of these deals the declarer has a specific trick-winning goal. Think about how you would plan the play as declarer on each of the deals that follow.|

pg| ***** 22 ***** |

cs|3|fp|t|n#|7|at|^-{ Example 1 - Planning the play at notrump }
^-|fp||
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


n#|7|at|This is a notrump deal (so remember, winners are the key). West's opening lead is the @S6. 
The first step of planning the play, identifying declarer's goal, is easy. 
|n#|7|at|Look at the bottom RIGHT corner of the card playing area where you can see ^*b4N^*n (^*bN^*n = Notrumps) by adding 6 to the ^*b4^*n you get, declarer's goal is to win ^*b10^*n tricks.  For now this is also given in the top LEFT.      (Why 6?  see next Ch.)|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Step 2A for planning the play of notrump deals is to count the number of immediate winners between the declarer and dummy hands. Try it and see what number you come up with.

|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The correct answer is that there are 8 immediate winners for North-South. South's solid clubs are worth 5 certain tricks. Declarer's @SA and @SK and dummy's @HA bring the total up to 8.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Step 2B for planning the play of notrump deals is easy. This step involves figuring out how many extra winners must be established to fulfill our goal as declarer.

|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have 8 immediate winners and the goal is to win 10 tricks. We will have to find a way to establish 2 extra winners if we are are to succeed in our trick-winning goal.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Step 2C for planning the play of notrump deals is the hardest step, but it is well within your abilities. Step 2C involves finding a sequence of plays that give us the best chance of establishing the 2 extra winners that we need.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The way to approach this step is to look at each of the 4 suits as card combinations.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The North-South spade holding contains 2 immediate winners, but it does not offer any potential as far as establishing extra winners is concerned.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In fact, spades seems to be the suit with the greatest potential for the defenders. North-South have only 5 spades, leaving 8 spades outstanding. Eventually, the defenders will be able to win several tricks in spades.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Further bad news is that West has attacked our weak spot with his opening lead. The defenders are off to a quick start in this race!|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The heart suit contains some potential. The @HA represents an immediate winner and, if West was dealt the @HK, 2 extra winners are possible by finessing twice. Those 2 extra tricks would be enough to achieve our 10 trick goal. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If East was dealt the @HK the finesse will lose, but promotion will result in 1 extra winner for North-South. 1 extra winner is not enough for us, but it is a start.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
So the heart suit is worth either 1 or 2 extra winners, depending on the location of the @HK. Hearts may provide all the extra winners we need. Should we go ahead then and take the heart finesse?
|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


cs|1|at|
^-{No!!! There are still some suits to look at. Try to consider
the whole deal before making any decisions about your plan.}|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The club suit is a source of pride as it is the source of 5 of our 8 immediate winners.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Unfortunately there is absolutely no hope of establishing any extra winners in the club suit. Once 5 rounds of clubs are played North-South will be out of cards in that suit.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The diamond suit is a pleasure to behold. South's 3-card diamond holding is solid except for the @DA. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There are no immediate winners in diamonds, but once the @DA is driven out, 2 extra winners will be established by promotion.
|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{The diamond suit is 100% certain to provide us with the 2 extra winners that we need.}|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North's heart suit ^*Imight^*N provide us with enough extra tricks (if West was dealt the @HK), but South's diamonds are ^*Icertain^*N to get the job done.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have examined all 4 suits and found a certain way to achieve our trick-winning goal. The plan should be to attack diamonds, not take the heart finesse.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Notice that we did all of our planning on this deal before playing a single card, even though there are no decisions to make at trick 1?

|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ht|b|cs|1|at|^-{Try to get into the habit of planning the play before playing from dummy to trick 1.
On some deals you can wait, but on others trick 2 is too late!}|

nt|^z@3^b@2|
nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|st|pc|s|at|
East plays the @S10 and we win the first trick with the @SK. It's time to put our plan into action!|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|pc|da|pc|d|pc|d|at|
The @DK is led to drive out the @DA (which was dealt to West).|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have succeeded in establishing the 2 extra winners that we need with the @DQ and @DJ. Let's just confirm that we are going to achieve our 10-trick goal.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have won 1 trick already and we have developed 2 extra winners in diamonds. That's 3 tricks. We also have 5 club tricks, the @SA, and the @HA - 10 winners in all.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|pc|sj|pc|s|at|
West continues spades and we win the trick with South's @SA.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
No doubt, the defenders have now established several spade winners for themselves, but that is no problem. We are on lead and we have established enough extra winners to achieve our goal.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is time to win some tricks.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ca|pc|c|pc|c|pc|c|at|
The order in which we take our winners does not really matter, but suppose we start by running South's solid clubs.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ck|pc|c|pc|c|pc|c|at|
Both defenders follow to the first 2 rounds of clubs. Do you know how many clubs East-West have left between their 2 hands?

|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South started with 5 clubs and North started with 4, leaving 4 for the defenders. Both defenders have followed twice, so all 4 clubs are accounted for. Both defenders are now void in clubs.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cq|pc|d|pc|c|pc|d|at|
Sure enough, both defenders discard diamonds on the third round of clubs.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cj|pc|d|pc|c|pc|d|at|
There are more diamond discards on the fourth round of clubs.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|d|pc|d|pc|h|at|
West discards yet another diamond and East discards a heart when South plays his last club.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dq|pc|h|pc|d|pc|h|at|
The defenders have discarded all of their diamonds already, so they cannot follow suit when the @DQ is played. Both East and West discard hearts.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|pc|s|pc|s|pc|h|at|
West discards a spade and East discards another heart on the @DJ.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|at|
Our next move is a heart towards the dummy. When West follows suit with a small card should we take the finesse?
|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{No!!! The goal is within reach. Do not finesse. Win the @HA! We have won
9 tricks. We need just 1 more. The @HA guarantees that we will reach our goal.}|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hq|at|
Suppose we get greedy and try to win a trick more than our goal by taking the finesse in hearts.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If West has the @HK everything will be OK - we will win 11 or 12 tricks.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hk|at|
If East was dealt the @HK, however, we are in trouble. The heart finesse loses as East wins the @HK.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


sk||
nt|^z@3^b@2
Look at the cards that remain. East will lead his remaining spade and West will win the last 2 tricks.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It will be quite embarrassing to have to discard the @HA, our goal-fulfilling trick, on West's spades!|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up||up||at|
Let's back up and do it right.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|pc|h|at|
Instead of finessing in hearts (and risking the goal if the finesse loses), make certain of the tenth trick by winning the @HA.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The defenders will win the last 2 tricks, but that is OK. 10 tricks is all we were trying to win and in that we have succeeded.
|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^^-{The goal has been achieved!}|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The lesson to be learned from this deal is very important:|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^^^-{Do not risk achieving your goal for the sake of tricks ^*Ibeyond^*N your goal.
It is fine to think about additional tricks ^*Iafter^*N the goal has been achieved.}|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If the goal had been 9 tricks (instead of 10) on this deal, it would have been OK to take the heart finesse at the end. Since 9 tricks can be won before hearts are played, losing the heart finesse would not risk the goal.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The heart finesse is an attempt to turn 10 sure tricks into 11 or 12 tricks, with the risk of winding up with only 9 tricks. That risk is acceptable if only 9 tricks are required, but it is not reasonable if the goal is to win 10 tricks!|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|44|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Have a look at all 52 cards from this deal.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
First consider West's choice of opening lead, the @S6.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When a deal is played at notrump, it is generally considered a good strategy for a defender to choose his opening lead from his longest and strongest suit.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The same principle does not apply when there is a trump suit. We saw that leading a side suit singleton or from a relatively short side suit headed by the Ace-King, King-Queen, or Queen-Jack is an attractive lead when there is a trump suit.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal West's diamonds (which are headed by the @DA) are ^*Istronger^*N than his spades (which are headed by the @SQ). However, West's spades are ^*Ilonger^*N than his diamonds. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Length is more important than strength when it comes to opening leads at notrump. Thus spades should be West's choice of suit to lead.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


md|0,d8,,c6|
nt|^z@3^b@2
If we change things a little by giving West an extra diamond, he should lead that suit instead. Now West's spades and diamonds are ^*Iequal^*N in length as each suit contains 5 cards. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Strength is used to break the tie. Since West's diamonds are ^*Istronger^*N than his spades, a diamond is now the recommended suit for West's opening lead.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


md|0,c6,,d8|
at|^tDeal now restored.|
cs|2|at|^^^^^-{It is a good strategy to lead from your longest and strongest
suit against notrump, with length taking priority over strength.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This strategy will not always produce the most effective opening lead for the defenders, but it tends to work out well on the majority of deals.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^^^^-{Unless your longest and strongest suit is headed by touching high cards,
it is considered good strategy to select, as your lead, the ^*Ifourth best card^*N in the suit.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West's spades are not headed by a combination of touching high cards so he should select his ^*Ifourth best^*N spade, the @S6, as his opening lead.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When there is a trump suit we saw that 2 touching high cards (such as the Ace-King, King-Queen, or Queen-Jack) were enough to make the suit attractive as an opening lead.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
At notrump things are different. Now 3 touching high cards (Ace-King-Queen, King-Queen-Jack, or Queen-Jack-Ten) are recommended before the lead of a high card is correct.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^^^^-{At notrump, if your longest and strongest suit is headed by 3 touching high cards, lead 
one of these cards. Otherwise, lead the ^*Ifourth best^*N card of your longest and strongest suit.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is difficult to justify this advice except by experience. Once you have played thousands of bridge deals you will know that the above advice is sound (but comes with no guarantees, of course).|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


pc|s6|
nt|^z@3^b@2
So West's recommended opening lead (and the lead that happens to be best for the defenders on this deal) is the @S6 - West's ^*Ifourth best card^*N in his longest and strongest suit.

|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |

Let's quickly review the steps we took in planning the play.|

That's just as well since West has been given one of our immediate winners from before, the @SK. All we have received in return is the @S7. The dummy and East also made a trade (a better one for our side). |

nt|^z@3^b@2
The dummy now has the @D10 and East has been given the @S4 instead. You will see an interesting effect of these changes. It is now critical for declarer to count possible losers, as well as winners, in planning the play.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
West's opening lead is still the @S6, his ^*Ifourth best card^*N in his longest and strongest suit. West's spades are headed by 2 touching high cards now, the King-Queen, but the ^*Ifourth best^*N lead is still recommended (versus the lead of the @SK or @SQ).|

pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Step 2B involves figuring out how many extra winners are required. Our goal is 9 tricks and we have 7 immediate winners. We therefore need to establish 2 extra winners.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Step 2C is the tricky part (no pun intended). We have to figure out the best way to establish the 2 extra winners that we need. |

This deal is very similar to the last deal we saw - hearts and diamonds are the only suits with the potential for extra winners.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's look at the heart suit as a possible source of extra winners.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If West has the @HK, 2 successful finesses would lead to the 2 extra winners we need. East actually has that card, however, so the hearts will provide just 1 extra winner - not enough. Remember that in real bridge the declarer would not know who held the @HK.|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Like the last deal, the diamond suit has better extra winner prospects than the heart suit.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Once the @DA is dislodged the @DQ, @DJ, and @D10 will all win tricks. The diamond suit is blocked, which might make it hard to win all 3 of these tricks, but even 2 diamond tricks would be enough to satisfy our 9-trick goal.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The decision seems easy. Hearts ^*Imight^*N provide us with enough extra winners (they do not since East has the @HK). Diamonds, however, are ^*Icertain^*N to provide us with the 2 extra winners that we need (as well as a possible bonus extra winner).|

Playing on diamonds for our extra winners, a sure thing on the last deal, has virtually no chance of working on this deal. Playing on diamonds involves losing the lead. Losing the lead means that the defenders will be able to take enough tricks to prevent us from achieving our goal.|

On the first of these deals South held both the @SA and @SK, 2 stoppers in the suit that West led.

Remember we learned that many bridge deals are a ^*Irace^*N between the 2 partnerships to see who can establish and cash their winners first? Each stopper declarer holds in the defenders' main suit(s) is an extra hurdle for them to cross in this race. Similarly, the high cards that the defenders hold in declarer's long suit(s) represent extra obstacles in the declarer's path.

|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|Since the defenders make the opening lead, they are always given a head start in this race. When the declarer has only 1 stopper in the defenders' long suit (as in the diagram on the right), the opening lead knocks out this stopper and the declarer cannot afford to lose the lead again. In this case the declarer must try to win enough tricks for the goal immediately - he is finished if the lead has to be lost.

n#|7|at|Here is another deal with a trump suit. This time hearts are trump and the goal is to win 10 tricks. West's opening lead is the @DK.  Think about how you would go about planning the play as declarer.|
pg| ***** 218 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It looks like the defenders will be in control for a few tricks. Thus, we can wait before planning the play (but you shouldn't do this on most deals!).|
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|pc|d|pc|d|at|
West's @DK opening lead wins the first trick.|

The @DJ is led to trick 3 and East overtakes with his @DA to win the trick.|
pg| ***** 222 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
East leads a spade. We can't put off planning the play any longer. Think about how you would continue playing this deal as declarer.|
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
After identifying our goal as 10 tricks, we should count our losers.|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have already lost 3 tricks in diamonds and the South hand still contains 2 spade losers. Dummy's @HA, @CA, and @CK are enough to ensure that there will be no losers in those suits. We had 5 losers to begin with and 3 of these have already been lost.|
pg| ***** 225 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The next step is to figure out how many losers must be eliminated. Since we need 10 tricks we can afford 3 losers. We lost those tricks already when the defenders ran the first 3 tricks in diamonds. |
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We must try to eliminate our remaining 2 losers. We can't afford to lose another trick. That makes our first decision very easy.|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|s|at|
It is clear to win the trick with the @SA. If we had played a low spade the defenders would win their fourth trick, making it impossible to achieve the goal.|
pg| ***** 228 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We are left with 2 losing spades to deal with. Since the dummy has only 1 spade left, it is possible to ruff one of South's spade losers in the dummy. There is just 1 problem. |
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Dummy would have to be made void in spades first. That would involve losing another trick and we must try to win all of the remaining tricks!|
pg| ***** 230 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The only hope of getting rid of ^*Iboth^*N of South's spade losers is to make use of the long club suit in the dummy. It might be possible to establish some extra winners in clubs to provide discards for South's losing spades. Can this work?|
pg| ***** 231 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It can work, but we will need some luck.|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Think about how the East-West clubs might be divided. We have 7 clubs between the North-South hands, leaving 6 clubs for the defenders. |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On a good day those 6 clubs will be divided 3 and 3. That is the first piece of luck we will need if there is to be any chance for us to achieve our goal.|
pg| ***** 234 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If we cash dummy's high clubs and ruff a club, the 2 clubs that remain in dummy will be extra winners - as long as the East-West clubs were divided 3-3. Those 2 extra winners can later be used to discard both of South's spade losers.|
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
What needs to be done in order to take advantage of a lucky club break?|
pg| ***** 236 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
One thing we will need for sure is an entry to the dummy so that the extra winners that we hope to set up in clubs can be cashed. The @HA is the only possible entry to dummy.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Remember that the @CA and @CK must be played ^*Ibefore^*N the club suit can be established - they cannot also act as late dummy entries for the extra winners.|
pg| ***** 238 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The other thing we need to worry about is that the defenders might be able to ruff our extra winners in clubs.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It will be necessary to draw all of the defenders' trumps before trying to use the extra winners that we hope to establish.|
pg| ***** 240 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since we must draw trump before using our extra winners and since the @HA is our only entry to those cards, we should plan to use the @HA to draw the last of the defenders' trumps.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Think about how the East-West trumps might be divided.|
pg| ***** 242 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The North-South hands contain 8 hearts, leaving 5 hearts for the defenders. We must hope that these cards are divided 3 and 2. Only in this way can the @HA be used to draw the last of the defenders' trumps. Yes, that means we will need some additional luck.| 
pg| ***** 243 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
So we have a plan:|
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
First, we will try to set up 2 extra winners in clubs. Next, we will try to draw all of the trump, ending with the @HA. Finally, we will use the 2 extra winners we are hoping for to discard South's 2 spade losers. Let's give it a try!|
pg| ***** 245 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|c|pc|ck|pc|c|at|
A club is led to the @CK (or @CA) in dummy.|
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ca|pc|c|pc|c|pc|c|at|
Dummy's remaining high club is cashed, voiding the South hand of clubs.|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is a good sign that the defenders have followed suit so far in clubs. If one of them had been able to ruff in, we would have ended up with an extra undertrick, but that is not the end of the world. |
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The only chance of achieving the goal requires the existence of a 3-3 club division. Risking an extra undertrick in the hope of achieving the goal is a sound investment.|
pg| ***** 249 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|c|pc|h|pc|c|at|
The next trick brings good news. Both defenders follow to the third round of clubs as South's ruff wins the trick. The East-West clubs were originally divided 3-3, a piece of good luck that we needed for our plan to work.|
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since East and West are now out of clubs, both of dummy's remaining small clubs represent extra winners. Be sure to understand that if clubs had been divided 4-2, then there still would be a club outstanding. |
PG| ***** 251 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Dummy's clubs would ^*Inot^*N be extra winners and it would be impossible to achieve the goal.|
pg| ***** 252 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hk|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|at|
Our next move should be to try to draw all of the outstanding trump, ending up with the @HA in the dummy. As long as the 5 East-West trumps are divided 3-2 we will succeed.|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Both defenders follow suit to the first round of trump, leaving 3 trumps outstanding.|
pg| ***** 254 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hq|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|at|
When both defenders follow suit to the second round of trump, we know that the suit was originally divided 3-2. There is only 1 trump outstanding and the @HA will take care of that card.|
pg| ***** 255 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|H|pc|h|pc|h|pc|s|at|
The @HA draws the last trump (which West was dealt) and East discards a spade.|
pg| ***** 256 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Be sure to appreciate just how nicely we timed the play.|
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We used the @HA at the perfect moment - a moment when the clubs were established and when the defenders had just run out of trump. It is now time to discard our spade losers.|
pg| ***** 258 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|s|pc|s|pc|d|at|
When a club is played from dummy for a spade discard and neither defender can ruff, it is clear that the plan has worked!|
pg| ***** 259 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Make sure that you understand that the 3-2 trump break was just as important as the 3-3 club break. If trumps had been 4-1 then one of the defenders would have been able to ruff in on the previous trick, putting the goal out of reach.|
pg| ***** 260 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
Dummy's last club is played and we discard our last spade loser from the South hand.|
pg| ***** 261 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
After a slow start we have won 9 tricks in a row. South's last card is the only trump left so the last trick will also be ours. The goal will be achieved!|
PG| ***** 262 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It took some luck to achieve our goal, but it also took a good plan to take advantage of that luck.|
pg| ***** 263 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|48|sk||at|
Have a look at all 52 cards, paying special attention to the defenders' clubs and hearts.|
PG| ***** 264 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Notice that both of these suits are divided as evenly as possible. We needed both of these even breaks to succeed in achieving our goal.|
pg| ***** 265 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We needed a 3-3 club break so that all of the defenders' clubs would be exhausted after 3 rounds of the suit were played (South ruffing the third round).|
PG| ***** 266 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Dummy's 2 remaining clubs will only be extra winners if the defenders' club are all gone after the third round is ruffed by South.|
pg| ***** 267 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The 3-2 trump break was also critical. It was necessary to draw ^*Iall^*N of the defenders' trumps ending up with the @HA in the dummy. |
PG| ***** 268 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since dummy has only 3 hearts we needed a 3-2 break to make this possible. If hearts had been 4-1 we could not draw all the trump ending with the @HA in dummy.|
pg| ***** 269 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The play we used to set up extra winners with dummy's long club suit is an example of the technique known as suit establishment. We have seen this technique before.|
pg| ***** 270 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Proper entry management was also vital on this deal. It was important to consider the entry situation when we planned the play. If we had drawn trump immediately, it would have been impossible to access dummy's extra winners. |
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @HA was dummy's only entry outside of the club suit. We had to save that entry until the clubs were established. We then had to wait until the @HA could draw the last of the defenders' trump.|
pg| ***** 272 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Remember that West's opening lead was the @DK. It looked like the defenders would be in control for the first few tricks, so we were able to postpone planning the play without any harm.|
pg| ***** 273 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal, it was reasonable to postpone planning the play until we had a decision to make. In fact, waiting actually made it easier for us to come up with a good plan.|
pg| ***** 274 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^^^-{ Be very careful, however, when you delay planning the play. On some deals

pg| ***** 277 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Planning the play seems easy on this deal. The goal is to win 9 tricks and we have 8 immediate winners, the @SA, @HA, and @HK, as well as 5 tricks in clubs. We will need to establish only a single extra winner in order to achieve our goal.|
PG| ***** 278 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You see, Steps 1, 2A, and 2B are easy enough that they fit into a single paragraph!|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
To make things even easier, diamonds is the only possible suit in which an extra winner can be established. South's diamond holding is certain to produce the extra winner we need by promotion. It would appear that there's not much to this deal.|
pg| ***** 280 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|pc|sa|at|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Have a look at the remaining cards and you will see what is going to happen.|
PG| ***** 283 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When East wins the @DA he will return a spade. West will win the next 4 spade tricks. The defenders will win 5 tricks in total, making it impossible for us to achieve our 9-trick goal.|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We made a mistake on this deal because it looked like we had a clear and easy plan to win 9 tricks. We did not stop to think about how many tricks the defenders might be able to win. We did not ask ourselves, "What could go wrong?"|
PG| ***** 285 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's go back to the beginning and consider the defenders' winners as well as our own.|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


up|3|
nt|^z@3^b@2
We are back at trick 1 and West has led the @SK.|
PG| ***** 287 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In order to figure out how many tricks the defenders can win in spades, we start by counting our own spades. There are 2 spades in the dummy and 3 spades in the South hand, leaving 8 spades for the defenders.|
pg| ***** 288 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In real bridge the declarer would not be able to see the defenders' hands so he would not know how the spade suit was divided between East and West.|
PG| ***** 289 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The declarer can speculate, however. When the 8 outstanding spades are distributed 5-3, as above (remember West has led the @SK already), the goal is in grave danger.|
pg| ***** 290 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
As we saw, the @SK opening lead established 4 extra winners for the defenders in spades. The @DA was the fifth trick for East-West, making it impossible for us to achieve our 9-trick goal.|
PG| ***** 291 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have no chance to win 9 tricks without the diamond suit, but when East wins the @DA the defenders win the race. They have 4 more tricks to cash.|
pg| ***** 292 ***** |


md|0,h9,,s9|
nt|^z@3^b@2
The East-West hands have been changed such that the 8 outstanding spades are now divided 4-4 between the 2 hands. 

On this layout of the spades the defenders are only able to establish 3 tricks in the suit.   The @DA is the defenders' fourth winner and the goal is safe.|
pg| ***** 293 ***** |


cs|4|at|^^^^^-{The goal is not at risk if the defenders' spades are divided 4-4.}|
pg| ***** 294 ***** |


md|0,s9,,h9|
nt|^z@3^b@2
So  - restoring the original cards -  we would be fine if spades are 4-4,  (which there are NOW not).|
PG| ***** 295 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Were we simply unlucky that spades were 5-3 when we first saw this deal and as above ?  Is there anything we could have done to achieve our goal on this layout of the spades?|
pg| ***** 296 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The problem is that with spades 5-3 and the @DA as a trick that must be lost, the defenders threaten to establish and cash 4 tricks in spades. We cannot stop them from establishing those tricks, but we may be able to stop them from cashing them. Do you see how?|
pg| ***** 297 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
Suppose that we allow West's @SK to win the first trick, by ducking the @SA. Does this look familiar at all?|
pg| ***** 298 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
West knows he is on to a good thing and continues with the @SQ and South ducks again.|
PG| ***** 299 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Don't worry about those 2 spades tricks that we just lost. We can afford to lose 2 (or even 3) spade tricks. The idea is to make sure that we don't lose 4 spade tricks. You will soon see that we are moving in the right direction.|
pg| ***** 300 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|pc|h|pc|s|pc|s|at|
West's third spade lead finally drives out the @SA, but East, having followed suit 3 times already, is now void in spades! That gets an exclamation point because East is the hand with the @DA!|
pg| ***** 301 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Yes, this is our friend the hold up play, again. The last time we saw this play the defenders used it against us to disrupt ^*Iour^*N entries.|
PG| ***** 302 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
And that's exactly what we have done to the defenders' with this hold up play - we have disrupted ^*Itheir^*N entries. This time the hold up play is working for us.|
pg| ***** 303 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|at|
Look at what happens now when we lead the @DK to drive out the @DA. We know we will be fine if the spades were originally divided 4-4. We may also be fine if the spades were divided 5-3. It depends on who holds the @DA.|
pg| ***** 304 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|pc|d|pc|da|at|
Since East was dealt the @DA on this deal we are going to achieve our goal. West is sitting there with 2 winning spades, but East has no spades left and there is no other ^*Iimmediate^*N entry to West's hand.|
pg| ***** 305 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have won a trick already and we will win the next 8 tricks regardless of what East leads. The hold up play deserves a lot of credit in helping us achieve our goal on this deal.|
pg| ***** 306 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|16|at|
Here are all the cards again. By holding up the @SA until the third round we were able to exhaust East of all 3 of his spades. Since the West hand contained no entries outside of the spade suit, the hold up play came through.|
pg| ***** 307 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Here's what happened when we failed to hold up the @SA the first time we played this deal:|
PG| ***** 308 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East had some spades left when he won the @DA. West, the hand with the long spades, therefore had an entry in the spade suit itself - the defenders won 4 spade tricks and the @DA, leaving us with just 8 tricks. It would have been a similar story if we had held up the @SA only once.|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |


md|0,da,,d9|
nt|^z@3^b@2
The deal has been changed so that West now has the @DA instead of East. Now not even the hold up play can help us to achieve our goal. |
PG| ***** 310 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West, the hand with the long spades, now has a sure entry. When you can't see the defenders' cards, you don't know if the hold up play will work, but it can never cost for declarer to try it.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
We know from the last deal that the defenders will establish 3 spade winners if their 8 spades are divided 4-4. They will establish 4 winners, however, if their spades are divided 5-3. If we have to lose 4 spades tricks we cannot afford to lose any other tricks.|

The North-South spade holding screams hold up play, but we shouldn't duck the first trick yet.|
PG| ***** 325 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It turns out that the hold up play is correct on this deal, but we really should think about where our extra winners are coming from before starting any plan. We will see a deal shortly where it would be wrong to automatically hold up with this spade combination.|
pg| ***** 326 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Both the diamond and club suits offer some serious potential for extra winners. The King is the only relevant missing card in both of these suits.|

We could simply drive out the King in the suit of our choice. The 3 extra winners that we need will be produced instantly via promotion.|

If some other suit were a greater threat than spades it would not be a good idea to duck this trick and give the
defenders a chance to switch suits.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
So we decide to go for the hold up play. We duck in dummy and allow West's @SQ opening lead to win the trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
West continues with the @SJ and wins trick 2 as we hold up the @SA a second time.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|st|pc|s|pc|s|
nt|^z@3^b@2
West persists in spades, leading the @S10 and dummy's @SA finally wins. East contributes the @SK. That's a pretty high spade! Perhaps our hold up play has succeeded in exhausting East of spades.|
pg| ***** 338 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have to make a discard from the South hand and it sure looks wrong to discard a heart. We can't really make a proper choice between diamonds and clubs unless we know which finesse we are going to take.|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's assume that West started with 5 spades and East started with 3. East is now out of spades, but West has
2 extra winners all ready to go should he gain the lead. If spades are 4-4 there will be no problem (as we can afford to lose 3 tricks in spades).|
PG| ***** 340 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Also assume that the finesse we choose will lose. Is the goal possible with that much bad luck?|
pg| ***** 341 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The goal is still possible if we take a losing finesse provided that the finesse we take is in clubs. In order to see why this is so, we will first try the (incorrect) diamond finesse.|
pg| ***** 342 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|at|
Since we are going to try the diamond finesse, we should keep our diamonds and discard a club from the South hand as dummy's @SA wins trick 3.|
pg| ***** 343 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The lead is conveniently in the right hand to take the diamond finesse. We should start by leading the @DQ or @DJ (that is, not the @D2) to the first trick. If the finesse works then the lead will remain in the dummy so that the finesse can be repeated.|
pg| ***** 344 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dq|pc|d|pc|d|pc|dk|

The next trick brings another storm. West leads a spade and wins the trick as the other 3 players discard. Apparently the spades were not divided 4-4 to begin with.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|h|pc|h|pc|c|
nt|^z@3^b@2
West wins the next spade trick as well. He is now out of spades, but the damage has been done. We have lost 5 tricks, the @DK and 4 spade tricks (2 at the beginning and 2 just now). We cannot possibly achieve our 9-trick goal anymore.|
pg| ***** 347 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|13|at|
We have gone back to trick 3 to try the club finesse instead. West has just led the third round of spades, knocking out the @SA, and we still have a discard to make from the South hand.|
pg| ***** 348 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|at|
Since we plan to finesse in clubs we will not be needing all of those diamonds anymore. The proper discard from the South hand is a small diamond. We should keep all 3 of South's clubs so that the finesse in that suit can be repeated ^*I3 times^*N if necessary.|
pg| ***** 349 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In order to take the club finesse the lead must come from the South hand, but the lead is currently in the dummy. South has entries in both hearts and diamonds. Any thoughts on which of these entries we should use?|
pg| ***** 350 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|at|
It is correct to use hearts as the entry to the South hand for the club finesse. If we use the @DA instead, the 
defenders' @DK would be set up for a trick (and a possible entry that the defenders might be able to use).|
pg| ***** 351 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cq|pc|c|pc|c|pc|c|

It was a nice try by East, but we have another club, the @C2, that can be used to reach dummy's remaining club

pg| ***** 403 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We always would have been OK if both finesses had won, but by winning the @SA at trick 1 we gave ourselves an extra chance to achieve our goal - we would still succeed with only 1 finesse working as long as spades were divided 4-4.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
West was dealt both critical Kings on this deal. The @CK was dealt ^*Iunder^*N the @CA making the club finesse succeed. The @DK was sitting ^*Iover^*N the @DA, however, making that finesse a loser.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
We had to lose a trick to the @DK to come to 9 tricks, but with the spades 4-4 the defenders could win just 4 tricks of their own (the @DK and 3 spade tricks). The @CK did not win a trick.|
pg| ***** 406 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Notice that we needed extra winners from both clubs and diamonds to have a chance. We could only ever win 5 tricks from one of these suits (if the finesse in that suit wins) and there were only 3 Aces as immediate winners on the side.|

The are 2 avoidance plays that have to be made on this deal in order to prevent dangerous East from gaining the lead. The first of these comes at trick 1, when West leads the @DK.|

Suppose we win trick 1 with the @DA as before. Look at the remaining East-West diamonds. Either defender could win a trick in diamonds. That means that the diamond suit can be used by the defenders for an entry to whichever hand they want.|
pg| ***** 452 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is a good bet that dangerous East will be the one to use this entry for the defenders. Should safe West get on lead he will lead his low diamond to reach the dangerous East hand.|

We can afford to lose a diamond trick on this deal, as long as we lose that trick to West. By ducking at trick 1 we make sure that West wins the defenders' diamond trick. We have neutralized dangerous East's possible entry in the diamond suit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dq|pc|d|pc|d|pc|da|at|
West continues the @DQ and this time we win the @DA. Dummy is now void in diamonds and can handle leads of that suit by ruffing. East is not going to gain the lead in diamonds, thanks to our clever duck at trick 1.|

pg| ***** 479 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This duck was not really a hold up play in the same sense as when we saw this play in some earlier notrump deals. In those deals we used the hold up play to exhaust one of the defenders of all of his cards in his partner's long suit. |
PG| ***** 480 ***** |

By doing so we forced the defenders to find another suit to provide an entry to the hand with the long suit.|
pg| ***** 481 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The hold up play on this deal was not designed to make one of the defenders void in diamonds. It's purpose was to make dummy void in diamonds without allowing East to gain the lead.|
PG| ***** 482 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

You may have found our second avoidance play on this deal shocking. Our finesse against the @SQ flies in the face of a reliable rule that we learned earlier, 9 never.|
PG| ***** 487 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
9 never suggests that we cash both the @SA and @SK, not finessing at all in the trump suit. Do you understand exactly why we ignored 9 never on this deal?|

nt|^z@3^b@2
If avoiding a trump loser was all that mattered we would have used 9 never. Our avoidance finesse went against 9 never, but made any resulting trump loser irrelevant as far as the goal was concerned - only safe West could win a trump trick the way we played.

Since there are 9 spades between the 2 hands, 9 never suggests that we should not finesse at all in spades. The @SA and @SK should be cashed in the hope that the @SQ drops singleton or doubleton. That would indeed be the correct play if we could not afford to lose a spade trick.

pg| ***** 504 ***** |


at|On the last deal the threatening distribution was somewhat obscure. West had to hold the @HA, there had to be a trump loser, clubs had to break badly, and East had to have an entry to lead a heart through our @HK. We came up with a neat safety play to guard against this particular unlucky division of the defenders' cards. Our safety play consisted of an avoidance duck in diamonds followed by an avoidance finesse in spades.

If we withhold dummy's @SQ (playing the @S3) there is almost no chance that the @SQ will ever win a trick. East will not play the @SK (unless he was dealt a singleton @SK) and the @SA will be forced out. The @SQ will be left unguarded and will fall under the @SK should the defenders gain the lead.|
pg| ***** 514 ***** |

Unfortunately, East covers the @SQ with his @SK. Our only spade stopper, the @SA, is about to be removed. It looks like it will be a bad idea to lose the lead after that.|
pg| ***** 516 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Now that we know the @SQ is not going to provide the extra winner that we need, let's do Step 2C properly and find the best way to establish an extra winner elsewhere.

|
pg| ***** 517 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The heart suit offers the possibility of several extra winners through ^*Irepeated^*N finesses against the @HK. If East was dealt the @HK the finesse will lose, but promotion will still result in 2 extra winners, more than enough.

|
pg| ***** 518 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If the heart finesse loses, however, we are likely in trouble even though 2 extra winners will be established. The defenders will almost certainly be able to run the spades, defeating the goal.|
PG| ***** 519 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It would be nice if clubs were trump, where we could stop the spades with ruffs, but this is notrump.|
pg| ***** 520 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The diamond suit also represents a chance to establish the extra winner we need. The @DA and @DK will win tricks for sure. We may be able to win a trick with the @DJ as well. Do you see how?

|
pg| ***** 521 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Leading the @DJ from the dummy for a finesse against the @DQ with East is not the correct answer. East would simply cover the @DJ with the @DQ if he was dealt that card. The lack of the @D10 makes the @DJ lead into a pseudo-finesse - it cannot gain if East is on his toes.|
PG| ***** 522 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This East has already demonstrated he knows about covering from his trick 1 play of the @SK.|
pg| ***** 523 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The only legitimate hope of winning a trick with the @DJ is to cash the @DA and @DK, hoping the @DQ will drop singleton or doubleton.|
pg| ***** 524 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The defenders have 7 diamonds between the 2 hands so it is not very likely that the @DQ will fall on the first or second round. Meanwhile, the heart finesse has a solid 50% chance to work - West is just as likely to have been dealt the @HK as East.

|
pg| ***** 525 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
By this reasoning we should rely on hearts, not diamonds, for the extra winner we need.|
pg| ***** 526 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In fact, it is not necessary to choose between hearts and diamonds for the source of the extra winner that we need. If we play our cards in the right order we can try both of these suits.
|
pg| ***** 527 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{ When planning the play you should try not to pin your hopes on any single suit.

pg| ***** 529 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is a different story if we play the @DA and @DK first. If the @DQ drops we will be home without having to rely upon the hearts. If the @DQ does not fall we will still have the lead and be able to try our luck in hearts.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
In fact, it is very unlikely to matter if we hold up the @SA or not. There were only 4 spades dealt to North-South and we can only hold up once. East's spades will only be exhausted if the 9 outstanding spades are divided 7 with West and 2 with East. Not very likely.|
PG| ***** 535 ***** |

At the same time, the hold up play can't really cost. We might as well try it.|

at|Imagine that West had chosen another suit for his opening lead and that East (the safe opponent since he holds the @SK) was able to win trick 1. We can see that East is the safe hand because he cannot harm us with a spade lead from his side of the table. We would win the @SK lead with our @SA and duck a small spade lead around to the @SQ in dummy.

cs|2|at|^-{None of this implies that a defender should never lead away from a King. Sometimes such a
lead will give up a trick to the Queen, but the lead from a King against notrump can also gain.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 565 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In fact, the opening lead from a long suit headed by the King against notrump is considered quite an attractive lead. Having the Queen (and Jack) to go with the King makes such a suit even better to lead from. Even if the Queen is missing, the Jack and Ten often make a difference. A holding like this:
^^^^ ^k|ih|pskjt94|at|
that is, a high card, then a gap, then some touching cards, is known as an interior sequence. 

A holding headed by touching cards with no gap (like @SKQJ) is simply called a sequence.

|
pg| ***** 566 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{The proper card to lead from an interior sequence is the card ^*Ibelow the gap^*N.

at|We have already learned that a 3-card sequence is recommended for a high card lead against notrump and that a 2-card sequence is sufficient for a high card lead when there is a trump suit. There is a similar guideline for interior sequences.

|

cs|3|at|^-{Against notrump you should have 4 cards in an interior sequence to lead a high card.

In each of these interior sequences, either the Ace or King is held, then there is a gap (in some cases a big one), then there are 3 more touching cards. Since the interior sequences above each contain 4 cards in total, the card ^*Ibelow the gap^*N should be led against notrump.|

pg| ***** 571 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|st||at|
Before we move on, there is one more remark to be made about the last deal.|
PG| ***** 572 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This lesson actually applies to several of the notrump deals we have seen in which the declarer is blessed with a long solid suit between his hand and the dummy. In this deal North-South had 6 immediate winners in clubs that could be cashed at any time.|
pg| ***** 573 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In the notrump deals that we have played we concentrated on establishing extra winners during the first few tricks, saving our long solid suits to win tricks at the end.|
PG| ***** 574 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There was nothing terribly wrong with this approach and it made it easier for us to focus on our main task 

^d- to  establish enough extra winners to satisfy the goal.|
pg| ***** 575 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On some notrump deals, however, it is desirable (or even necessary) to run the winners in a long solid suit early in the play. On this deal we really should have run the clubs at once.|
pg| ***** 576 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Recall that West's opening lead in spades knocked out our only stopper. We wisely cashed the @DA and @DK first, prepared to fall back on the heart finesse should the @DQ refuse to drop.

|
pg| ***** 577 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
We were lucky in that the @DQ was doubleton, making the heart finesse unnecessary (which is just as well since East was dealt the @HK).|
pg| ***** 578 ***** |


md|0,d9,,h6|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose that the @DQ was well guarded, as it is now in the above diagram.|
PG| ***** 579 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @DQ will not fall under the @DA and @DK anymore. When the heart finesse also fails the defenders will be able to win several spade tricks and at least 1 trick in diamonds as well. We will suffer multiple undertricks in our attempt at achieving the goal.|
pg| ***** 580 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In general, the declarer should not worry about extra undertricks - he should go all out in trying to achieve the goal. Sometimes declarer can avoid extra undertricks by playing a long suit first.
|
pg| ***** 581 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^^-{If declarer takes his club tricks at once, before proceeding with the rest of the plan,
he loses nothing and greatly reduces the defenders' ability to win extra undertricks.}|
pg| ***** 582 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Our plan was basically sound, but suppose we had run the club suit immediately upon winning the @SA. Then we would cash the @DA and @DK before trying the heart finesse (if necessary).|
PG| ***** 583 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If you add it all up, we would win the first 9 tricks before we had to risk losing the lead. At worst we would come within 2 tricks of achieving our 11-trick goal.|
pg| ***** 584 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
When we played this deal we did not run the clubs at once. Our plan involved winning only 3 tricks, the @SA, @DA, and @DK, before we might have had to lose the lead.|
PG| ***** 585 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That left 9 tricks that the defenders might have been able to win. If our luck was really bad there may have been as many as 7 undertricks!|
pg| ***** 586 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Extra undertricks are not the end of the world - achieving the goal is much more important. Still, it is desirable to avoid extra undertricks if possible - just don't risk the goal to do so.|
PG| ***** 587 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It could not have hurt to run the clubs at once. Playing clubs is unlikely to help as far as the goal itself is concerned, but the potential for extra undertricks would have been greatly reduced.|
pg| ***** 588 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is a further benefit that might come from playing clubs at once and this benefit is directly related to the goal. We have 10 clubs between our hands, leaving only 3 for the defenders. They are going to have to make a lot of discards.|
pg| ***** 589 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^-{It is possible that the defenders will not discard wisely. Imagine, for
example, that West chooses to discard a diamond on any of the clubs.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 590 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West's @DQ is currently guarded by 2 small cards which prevent it from falling when the @DA and @DK are played. If West were to discard a small diamond, however, it would be a different story.|
pg| ***** 591 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Perhaps you think it would be foolish of West to discard a diamond from his holding on the run of the clubs. On this particular deal a diamond discard by West would indeed be a poor choice, but remember, West cannot see all of the cards. |
PG| ***** 592 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
He does not know that the @DA and @DK are in the South hand, making it necessary for him to hold on to all 3 of his diamonds.|
pg| ***** 593 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There are even deals in which a defender has no choice but to discard a ^*Icritical card^*N (such as a small diamond from West) when the declarer runs a long suit.|
pg| ***** 594 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^^^-{A good reason for running a long solid suit at notrump is that the defenders may

bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|^^So we have seen 2 good reasons why, at notrump, a declarer may wish to run his immediate winners in a long solid suit before trying to establish extra winners:

|

cs|1|at|^-{If there is a risk that the defenders may gain the lead when the declarer tries to establish

pg| ***** 598 ***** |


at|This does not imply that it is ^*Ialways^*N correct for declarer to run a long solid suit at notrump. Here are some reasons declarer might choose to wait:

|
pg| ***** 599 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^^^-{Sometimes declarer will need the long solid suit to provide the entries

cs|1|at|{Sometimes it will be you, not the defenders, who has trouble finding good discards.
Always consider what you will discard from the short hand before running a long suit.}

^-

pg| ***** 609 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Our heart loser will be easy to eliminate - dummy has fewer hearts than South so it should be possible to eventually ruff South's heart loser in the dummy.|
PG| ***** 610 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The defenders have only 3 diamonds between them so we can plan to draw all of the defenders' trumps before ruffing South's fourth heart in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 611 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Things are somewhat more grim in the spade suit. Dummy has the same number of spades as South so it looks like we won't be able to ruff the @SQ in dummy.|
PG| ***** 612 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We could always finesse East for the @SK, of course, but it would be nice to find some extra chance to win 13 tricks without having to rely on a finesse. Do you have any ideas?|
pg| ***** 613 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Take a second look at North-South's hearts. There are 7 hearts between the 2 hands, leaving 6 hearts for both defenders. If those 6 hearts are divided 3-3 between the East-West hands, they will all fall under the @HA, @HK,
and @HQ.|
PG| ***** 614 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South's remaining small heart will not be a loser after all - in fact it will be an extra winner.|
pg| ***** 615 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Most of the extra winners that we have seen have been in dummy and were used to discard losers from the South hand.   Can an extra winner in the South hand do us any good?|
pg| ***** 616 ***** |


cs|1|n#|3|at|^^^-{Yes it can. We can use an extra winner in hearts to discard one of dummy's spades.

pg| ***** 619 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The plan is coming together nicely. We will play hearts before spades and discard a spade from dummy if hearts are 3-3. If hearts do not divide evenly, we will fall back on the spade finesse.|
pg| ***** 620 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^^^^-{It is time to ask ourselves, "What could go wrong?"}
^-
|
pg| ***** 621 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
2 things could go wrong. First, the defenders might win a trick with a ruff. It is easy to stop this danger. We can afford to draw all of the defenders' trumps - there will still be trumps left in dummy to handle any ruffs we might need.|
pg| ***** 622 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The other thing we need to worry about is that an entry to dummy will be required in case we have to fall back on the spade finesse.|
PG| ***** 623 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Again this is no big deal. Dummy has the @DA for an entry, but we can also ruff the @H2 (if it does not become a winner) to gain access to the dummy for the spade finesse.|
pg| ***** 624 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
OK - we have a great plan and we have made sure nothing can go wrong (at least nothing we can control - we still might fail if we are unlucky).|
pg| ***** 625 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hq|at|

pg| ***** 626 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|pc|d|pc|d|pc|d|at|
Both defenders follow to the first round of diamonds. East-West began with 3 diamonds so there is only one trump outstanding.|
PG| ***** 627 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

It turns out we will never need the @DA as a dummy entry, but it was still a good idea to retain this card. Keeping the entry position as ^*Iflexible^*N as possible is always a smart move.|

Before you try the exercises that follow, it might be useful to review some of the important lessons we have learned about planning the play as declarer.

|
pg| ***** 645 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{Planning the play is centered around trying to achieve the goal. Overtricks
and extra undertricks are not as important as achieving the goal.}

|
pg| ***** 646 ***** |


cs|3|at|{At notrump, planning the play focuses on winners. Declarer counts his immediate
winners and then figures out how many extra winners he needs to establish.}

|
pg| ***** 647 ***** |


cs|2|at|{When there is a trump suit declarer focuses on losers. Declarer counts his
losers and then figures out how many of those losers will have to be eliminated.}

|
pg| ***** 648 ***** |


cs|3|at|{Then the hard part. Declarer figures out the best way to establish enough extra winners
(at notrump) or to eliminate enough losers (when there is a trump suit) to achieve the goal.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 649 ***** |


at|The declarer has all sorts of techniques at his disposal for establishing extra winners and eliminating losers. We learned about many of these techniques in earlier chapters:

|cs|1|at|^C{Promotion}     {Finesses}     {Suit establishment (setting up small cards in long suits)} 

^C   {Discarding losers on extra winners in dummy}     {Ruffing losers in dummy}|
pg| ***** 650 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|We learned that the proper time to plan the play is at trick 1. Ideally, you should have your plan worked out before you play from dummy to the first trick. In practice, however, it is often the case that declarer can delay making his full plan by several tricks. Here are 2 reasons why declarer might be able to get away with delaying his plan:

|
pg| ***** 651 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{1. The defenders are going to win the first several tricks while declarer and dummy both
follow suit with small cards. The plan can be delayed until there is a real decision to be made.}

|
pg| ***** 652 ***** |


cs|1|at|{2. Some deals are too complex to plan all the way through. The declarer can sometimes
survive by using ^*Igeneral principles^*N on the first few tricks and planning fully later.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 653 ***** |


at|We saw that it was sometimes correct for a declarer at notrump to run a long solid suit immediately (to limit extra undertricks or to force the defenders to make discards). Other times, declarer should delay running a long solid suit and concentrate on establishing extra winners first (the solid suit may be needed for entries, for example). The guideline we came up with was not very satisfying:

|
pg| ***** 654 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{Immediately run a long solid suit at notrump unless you can think of a good reason not to.}

nt|^z@3^b@2

The heart suit could produce an extra trick if a finesse against the @HA were to succeed. |

pg| ***** 670 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The North-South club combination contains a 2-way finesse against the @CQ. Even if the finesse is taken the wrong way and the defenders are able to win the @CQ, the one extra winner you need will have been established via promotion. Losing a club trick is fine on this deal as long as the defenders cannot win 4 more tricks when they gain the lead.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal East is the dangerous opponent. If East is on lead he can attack the @HK, putting the goal at risk when West was dealt the @HA. West is the safe opponent - as long as he is on lead the @HK is immune from attack.

The only possible losers are in the trump suit. At first glance it looks like 8 ever should apply since North-South have an 8-card club fit missing the @CQ. Finessing East for the @CQ would be the correct play (as 8 ever suggests) if the goal was to win all 13 tricks. |
PG| ***** 741 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since the goal is only 12 tricks, however, a club finesse would be an unnecessary risk - if the club finesse were to lose, West might be able to give East a ruff.|

There are several points of interest in this deal. First let's reconsider what happened in clubs. Once the @CA was unblocked and a second round was led from dummy, East's @CK was trapped. If East covered with the @CK, |

South would ruff and later discard on dummy's high club. |

In a sense East's @CK was ^*Itrapped^*N in the same way as it would be by a finesse. In fact, the play we saw in clubs is actually known as a ruffing finesse because ruffing is an essential part of its mechanism. |

Like the other finesses we have seen, the ruffing finesse will sometimes lose. West now has the @CK and will win the trick when South discards.

Dummy's @CJ has been promoted into a winner - the usual consequence when a ruffing finesse fails. On this deal the discard comes too late, but it could be useful on a different deal.|
