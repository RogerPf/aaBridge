^-{  The finesse against a King  }
^-|fp||cs||at|
Your studies of trick-taking and card combinations have come a long way. We have seen some solid suits, suits in which tricks can be won via promotion, and long suits in which the small cards can win tricks.

The card combinations we studied so far have one thing in common: They all contained lots of touching cards.

When there are ^*Igaps^*N in a card combination things get more complicated...|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^b@2|ht|c|cs|2|at|We have seen that this card combination, a 2-card solid suit, is certain to win 2 tricks.
|
ht|e|at|^F  {|ih|ps32|at|}|
ht|g|at|^F {|ih|psAK|at|}
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ht|i|at|We have also seen that a 2-card solid suit missing the Ace, is certain to win 1 trick (with the help of promotion).|

ht|e|at|^L  {|ih|ps32|at|}|
ht|g|at|^L {|ih|psKQ|at|} 
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ht|l|at|What about this specimen with a gap ?    North-South hold the @SAQ, but the @SK is missing ?|
ht|e|at|^S  {|ih|ps32|at|}|
ht|g|at|^S {|ih|psAQ|at|} |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|n|at|It can't be as good as the first combination (since it has the @SQ instead of the @SK). At the same time it must be better than the second combination (since it has the @SA instead of the @SK). Logic suggests that this combination is worth between 1 and 2 tricks, but that seems a bit silly - there are only whole tricks in bridge.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|st||
md|saq,st9,s32,skj|wt|n|at|
As you are about to see, the concept is not silly at all. This card combination is worth about one and a half tricks! Suppose that the lead is in the North hand (the dummy).|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s2|at|
North leads the @S2 and East has a decision to make. Should he play the @SK or the @SJ?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|at|
Suppose that East decides to play his @SK.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|at|
South makes the obvious play of the @SA (it would be silly to play the @SQ and intentionally lose the trick).|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s9|at|
West follows suit with the @S9 and South wins trick 1. It is easy to see that the @SQ is high and that South will win trick 2 as well. North-South will therefore win 2 tricks if East plays his @SK on the first trick.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|1|up|1|up|1|at|
Suppose we let East take back his play of the @SK,|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


pc|sj|at| and let him play his @SJ instead. South now gets a chance to make a cool play. Can you see it?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|at|
South inserts the @SQ which started the trick as the third highest spade.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s9|at|
When West follows with the @S9, however, the @SQ is just big enough to win the trick! South still has the @SA so he is certain to take a second trick. So, even if East plays the @SJ to trick 1, North-South can take 2 tricks with this card combination.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|1|up|1|at|
Make sure that you understand that when East plays the @SJ it is necessary for South to play the @SQ in order to win a second trick.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|at|
Suppose that South plays the @SA instead of the @SQ.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s9|at|
West follows and South has won the first trick as before. The difference is that East's @SK is going to win the second trick. North-South will take just 1 trick. South's play of the @SQ (instead of the @SA) gained a trick.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


md|saq,st9,s32,skj|
nt|^z@3^b@2
It may not be immediately obvious how much North contributed to his partnership's success in taking 2 tricks with this combination. Suppose the lead had started out in the South hand. South can play either the @SA or the @SQ. Let's see how the @SA works.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sj|at|
If South plays the @SA, East will play the @SJ. East has kept the @SK to win the second trick.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|1|up|1|up|1|up|1|at|
Suppose that South tries the effect of the @SQ lead (instead of the @SA which holds North-South to 1 trick).|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sk|at|
East simply wins the trick with the @SK, again holding North-South to a single trick. The lead has to come from the North hand for North-South to come to a second trick. North's contribution is a big one despite his small cards.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||cs|3|n#|5|at|To summarize, with this card combination:|
ht|c|at|^d{|ih|psaq,st9,s32,skj|at|}

2 tricks are available to North-South, provided that:

|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{1. The lead comes from the North hand.}
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


cs|4|at|
{2. If East plays the @SK, South plays the @SA.}
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


cs|2|at|
{3. If East plays the @SJ, South plays the @SQ.}|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|at|

Well, it would be nice if North-South could always come to 2 tricks with the @SAQ facing small cards, but unfortunately only half the story has been told.|
ht|e|at|^C{|ih|psaq,st9,s32,skj|at|}|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


cs|2|ht|e|at|^O{|ih|psaq,skj,s32,st9|at|}

This is the other half of the story. Sometimes West, not East, will be dealt the @SK. 

With proper play North-South can take 2 tricks whenever East is dealt the @SK. Can you see how many tricks will be available to North-South when West is dealt the @SK instead?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|st||
md|saq,skj,s32,st9|at|
Let's see what happens to North-South when West has the @SK instead of East. It is still futile, for the same reasons as when East held the @SK, for South to lead either the @SA or the @SQ out of his hand.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|wt|n|pc|s2|at|
Suppose, therefore, that a spade is led from North - the play that worked so well when East was dealt the @SK.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s9|at|
East follows with the @S9 and South must decide what to play. He can play either the @SA or the @SQ. As you will see, South will win just 1 trick regardless of which card he plays.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|at|
Suppose that South plays the @SA.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|at|
West follows with the @SJ and South's @SA wins the trick. It's game over for North-South, however, as West's @SK will win trick 2. North-South are therefore held to a single trick if South plays the @SA.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|1|up|1|at|
Let's see what happens if South plays the @SQ (instead of the @SA) to trick 1.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|at|
The @SQ was a nice play when East was dealt the @SK.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|at|
When West is dealt the @SK, however, South's play of the @SQ works no better than the play of the @SA did. West wins trick 1 with the @SK, again holding North-South to a single trick.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||at|
To summarize, whenever South is dealt the @SAQ opposite small cards:|cs|3|ht|d|at|^C{|ih|psaq,skj,s32,st9|at|}|
cs|2|ht|o|at|^D{  If West was dealt the @SK,
^DNorth-South can win 1 trick.}
|ht|o|at|^M But...|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


cs|3|ht|d|at|^O{|ih|psaq,st9,s32,skj|at|}|
cs|2|ht|o|at|^q{   If East was dealt the @SK,
^q  North-South can win 2 tricks.}|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|

The @SK is equally likely to have been dealt to either defender so half the time North-South will win 2 tricks with this combination. The other half of the time North-South will win just 1 trick. You can now see that it is not so silly to say that this combination is worth a trick and a half!|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ht|b|cs|3|at|Do you understand why the position of the @SK is so important?|
ht|d|at|^C{|ih|psaq,skj,s32,st9|at|} ^O{|ih|psaq,st9,s32,skj|at|}

|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|It has to do with one of the first rules we learned about bridge:|

cs|1|at|

^-{The 4 players take turns playing cards to each trick in a clockwise rotation.}|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|

^-In the diagram on the left, West holds the @SK. He is sitting clockwise ^*Iafter^*N South. West therefore plays ^*Iafter^*N South and doesn't have to decide which card to play until ^*Iafter^*N South plays first.|
cs|2|ht|d|at|^C{|ih|psaq,skj,s32,st9|at|}|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ht|b|cs|3|at|In the diagram on the right,|
ht|d|at|^C{|ih|psaq,skj,s32,st9|at|} ^O{|cs|2|ih|psaq,st9,s32,skj|at|}

East, sitting clockwise ^*Ibefore^*N South, has the @SK. When North leads East must decide which card he will play ^*Ibefore^*N South does. No matter which card East plays South has an answer - South will play the @SA if East plays the @SK, but South will play the @SQ if East plays the @SJ.|
cs|1|at|

^-{The fact that South plays ^*Iafter^*N East when the lead comes from the North
hand is critical. South's decision will be based on the card that East plays.}|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ht|b|cs|3|at|Let's take the spade layouts we have been studying,|
ht|d|at|^C{|ih|psaq,skj,s32,st9|at|} ^O{|ih|psaq,st9,s32,skj|at|}|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|
ht|d|at|^C{|ih|ps32,skj,saq,st9|at|} ^O{|ih|ps32,st9,saq,skj|at|}

and turn them upside down. Now the @SAQ is with North and South has the @S32. Can you see the difference that this makes?|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|

Now when West is dealt the @SK (the diagram on the left) North-South can win 2 tricks. The lead must come from the South hand. Since North plays ^*Iafter^*N West, North-South can come to a second trick in spades.|
cs|2|ht|d|at|^C{|ih|ps32,skj,saq,st9|at|}|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|at|
When East has the @SK (the diagram on the right):|
ht|d|at|^C{|ih|ps32,skj,saq,st9|at|} ^O{|cs|2|ih|ps32,st9,saq,skj|at|}|
ht|o|at|
Now North-South can take only 1 spade trick. East makes his decision ^*Iafter^*N North and he has an effective counter to both of North's choices.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|at|
When East has the @SK (the diagram on the right):|
ht|o|at|
Now North-South can take only 1 spade trick. East makes his decision ^*Iafter^*N North and he has an effective counter to both of North's choices.

Turning this combination upside down does not really alter North-South's trick-taking prospects. Sometimes 2 tricks will be available (in the left diagram where West has the @SK) and sometimes only 1 trick will be available (in the right diagram where East has the @SK).

pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|
There is a big difference, however, between these combinations, despite the fact that they are mirror images of one another:|
ht|d|at|^H {|ih|ps32|at|} |n#|t|at|^P{|ih|psaq|at|}|
ht|f|at|^H {|ih|psaq|at|} |n#|t|at|^P{|ih|ps32|at|}|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ht|h|at|
With the @SAQ in the South hand (the combination on the left), North-South will take a second trick if East was dealt the @SK and the lead comes from the North hand.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ht|k|at|
When the @SAQ are in the North hand (the combination on the right) North-South will take a second trick if West was dealt the @SK and the lead comes from the South hand.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ht|n|cs|1|at|
^-{In general, the @SK must be ^*Iunder^*N the @SAQ for North-South to win 2 tricks.}

^-The words ^*Iunder^*N and ^*Iover^*N are often used in bridge to describe the position of cards in relation to one another. 
^*IUnder^*N means counter-clockwise while ^*Iover^*N means clockwise.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|n#|5|at|
The play of leading from the @S32 with these combinations:|

ht|d|at|^H {|ih|ps32|at|} |n#|t|at|^P{|ih|psaq|at|}|
ht|f|at|^H {|ih|psaq|at|} |n#|t|at|^P{|ih|ps32|at|}|

ht|h|at|^^with the intention of playing the @SA should the @SK appear, and playing the @SQ otherwise, is an example of a technique that bridge players call a finesse.

There are many types of finesses in bridge and we will examine several of these in this chapter. The finesse is one of the most useful ways for a declarer to win extra tricks at bridge. It is not that easy to come up with a good general definition of the finesse, but the following is reasonable:

|cs|1|at|^-{A finesse is a play that will win an extra trick (or tricks) in a suit, provided
that a key card (or cards) is located in a particular defender's hand.}|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In some ways, this card combination that includes a finesse:|
cs|2|ht|c|at|
^E{|ih|ps32|at|}
|cs|2|at|^E{|ih|psaq|at|}
|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ht|i|at|^-is similar to this combination (and
others) that we have seen before.
^-|ht|c|at|
^S   {|cs|3|ih|ps543|at|}
^S  {|cs|3|ih|psakq2|at|}
|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|
You will recall that luck had some roll to play in the number of tricks that North-South can win with the combination of cards on the right. A 3-3 spade division of the 6 East-West spades will result in 4 tricks for North-South, while any other spade division will hold North-South to 3 tricks. The luck of the deal plays a factor in the number of spade tricks North-South can win.
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|
The same is true of the combination on the left, the one with the finesse. Luck matters. In this case it is the position of a specific card, the @SK, not the number of spades that each defender was dealt, that is critical. If the @SK was dealt ^*Iunder^*N the @SAQ (that is with East) the finesse will succeed and North-South can win 2 tricks. If the @SK is sitting ^*Iover^*N the @SAQ (with West), the finesse will fail to produce a second spade trick for North-South.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
If the combination with the finesse is:

|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psaq|at|}
{|ih|ps32|at|}
^-The @SK is missing and it is equally likely to have been dealt to East or to West. If West has the @SK the finesse will work, but if East has the @SK the finesse will fail.|
cs|1|at|

^-{In general, a finesse is a 50-50 proposition.
A finesse will gain a trick half of the time and break even the other half of the time.}

|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at|^-Just because a finesse gains a trick only half of the time, you shouldn't be afraid to use this technique. On many deals a finesse will be declarer's best (or only) chance to win as many tricks as he can. 

Trying finesses is fun, but don't get into the habit of trying every finesse that you see. As you will learn, there are some deals where a different technique will offer better odds for an extra trick than the 50-50 finesse.|

at|^^Here is a complete bridge deal that contains a finesse similar to the one we just saw.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cj|at|
West's opening lead is the @CJ. And that's a dummy!|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cq|pc|c5|pc|c2|at|
North's @CQ wins the first trick.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have already won the first trick. The dummy has solid suits in both diamonds and clubs. There are 4 certain diamond tricks and 2 more club tricks for North-South.

|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South's heart holding contains the 3 top hearts, the @HA, @HK, and @HQ. That means 3 sure heart tricks and 10 tricks in total outside of spades.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The North-South spade combination looks something like the finesse we just learned about. The dummy has the @SJ now, in addition to the @SA and @SQ, but the @SK is missing.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @SA represents 1 sure spade trick for a total of 11 immediate winners. Perhaps South can take more than 1 spade trick by finessing West for the missing @SK.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The first thing you should remember about finesses is that the lead must come from the hand ^*Iopposite^*N the critical holding. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In this case North has all the high spade cards so the lead will have to come from the South hand. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Unfortunately, the lead is now in the North hand. Can you see any way that South can arrange to get the lead to his own hand (rather than the dummy)?|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
If you thought "hearts" that is very good thinking!|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

There are finesses in bridge against other cards as well. The next specimen that we will examine is the finesse against an Ace. An example of this play is shown in the combination on the right.

pg| ***** 122 ***** |

Remember that the basic reason a finesse works is that it forces a defender to make a critical decision ^*Ibefore^*N the declarer. East and South are the players with the big decisions to make.

The concept of East being required to cover the @SQ with the @SK is very important to understand. If East fails to
cover the @SQ (by playing the @SJ) South will play the @S2 and win a trick he is not entitled to. 

By covering the @SQ with his @SK East is sacrificing his best spade to South's @SA. At the same time, however, East's play of the @SK promotes his @SJ into the master spade, limiting North-South to 1 spade trick.

First, suppose that West elects to play his @SK.|
pg| ***** 287 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s4|pc|s8|at|
North plays his remaining small spade and East also follows suit. West's @SK wins trick 2.|
pg| ***** 288 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
With the @SA and @SK gone, North's @SQ has become the highest spade in the deck. As soon as North gains the lead he will be able to win a trick with that card.|

Suppose that West chooses to play his @SJ (instead of the @SK) to trick 2.|
pg| ***** 291 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|at|
The play of the @SJ makes it harder on North, but he should figure out the correct play. The @s4 is not going to work - West's @SJ would win this trick and the defenders would still have the @SK, rendering the @SQ worthless.|
pg| ***** 292 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|at|
North, therefore, plays the @SQ, finessing West for the @SK.|

Here is a complete deal containing a card combination similar to the one we have just studied.|
pg| ***** 300 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|hj|at|
West's opening lead is the @HJ and North puts down a useful dummy.|
pg| ***** 301 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The spade suit should look familiar - it is exactly the same as the latest combination we studied in our quest to master the finesse. A second spade trick (besides the @SA) should be possible if West was dealt the @SK.|
pg| ***** 302 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's have a quick look at the other suits first. South has a solid suit in clubs that is sure to provide 5 tricks. The @HA, @HK, @HQ, @DA, and @DK bring the total up to 10 tricks outside of the spade suit.|
pg| ***** 303 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @SA is a sure eleventh trick. If West was dealt the @SK then dummy's @SQ will represent a twelfth trick-winner for the declarer once the finesse in that suit has been taken.|
pg| ***** 304 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There are a couple of pitfalls to avoid on this deal. The first test comes at trick 1. Declarer could win the @HJ lead with dummy's @HA or with the @HQ or @HK in the South hand.|
pg| ***** 305 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Does it make any difference where declarer wins this trick?|
pg| ***** 306 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|pc|h|pc|h|at|
In fact it is correct to win the heart lead in the South hand (with either the @HK or the @HQ). Watch what happens if declarer makes the mistake of winning the @HA in the dummy at trick 1.|
pg| ***** 307 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|pc|sa|pc|s|at|
Declarer continues by leading a small spade from the dummy to the @SA. Once every year or so the @SK will fall under the @SA, but not on this particular deal. Both defenders follow suit with small spades.|
pg| ***** 308 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
Declarer continues with a small spade towards the dummy. If all goes as planned West will have the @SK and dummy's @SQ will win a trick.|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|pc|s|pc|s|at|
West plays the @SK and wins trick 3. The spade finesse has succeeded and dummy's @SQ is poised to win a trick for the declarer.|
pg| ***** 310 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is just one problem. Can you see it?

|
pg| ***** 311 ***** |


ht|f|cs|1|at|^-{The @SQ is stranded!}|
pg| ***** 312 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @SQ is the master spade now, but South has no more spades in his hand. Therefore, the lead will have to come from the dummy in order for declarer to win a trick with the @SQ. Unfortunately, the dummy does not have any other cards that might win tricks. The @SQ will be left to rot! Don't you wish the dummy still had the @HA?|
pg| ***** 313 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|11|at|
Let's go back to the first trick and see how much better it works for declarer to win the opening lead in the South hand with either the @HK or the @HQ.|
pg| ***** 314 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @HA is dummy's only sure trick-winner. Declarer should save that card until he is ready to use it. That time has not come yet.|
pg| ***** 315 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hq|at|
Declarer wins the opening lead with the @HQ in the South hand, saving dummy's only sure trick-winner, the @HA, for later.|
pg| ***** 316 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
The @SA is cashed and both defenders follow suit with small spades as before.|
pg| ***** 317 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|sk|pc|s|pc|s|at|
Declarer leads a low spade towards dummy's @SQ. West wins his @SK establishing the @SQ as the highest remaining spade.

|
pg| ***** 318 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The difference this time is that dummy still has the @HA. The presence of that card means that declarer has an easy way to win a trick in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 319 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ht|at|
West continues his heart attack, giving declarer an immediate chance to get to the dummy. West's heart play here is not a mistake. If he had led diamonds or clubs, South would have won that trick in his hand and played a heart to dummy's @HA himself.|
pg| ***** 320 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|pc|h|pc|h|at|
Declarer wins West's heart return with dummy's carefully preserved @HA.|
pg| ***** 321 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
This is the last time that the lead will be in dummy. It's now or never for the @SQ!|
pg| ***** 322 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
After West follows suit, South, who is out of spades, has to find a discard. Any ideas what card South should play?|
pg| ***** 323 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|at|
Hopefully you said the @D2, the only card in the South hand that is not a certain trick-winner. One of the more reliable rules of bridge strategy applies to this situation:
|cs|1|at|^-{Hold on to your winners, discard your losers!}|
pg| ***** 324 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|at|Apparently West is also out of spades. He discards a club and dummy's @SQ wins the trick.|
pg| ***** 325 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have already won 4 tricks and South's 8 remaining cards are all certain to win future tricks. Declarer's good plays in the heart and spade suits (along with some luck in that West was dealt the @SK) resulted in a total of 12 tricks for North-South.|
pg| ***** 326 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Declarer, in fact, made a subtle error on this deal. He was lucky in that his mistake did not cost on this particular layout of the East-West cards.|
pg| ***** 327 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|19|
md|0,s7,,sk|at|
We will now return to trick 1 and see how South might have to pay for his mistake. Yes, you will be told what South's mistake was, but first watch the possible consequences of South's choice of plays...|
pg| ***** 328 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hq|at|
South wins the @HQ as before, saving the @HA as a means to reach the dummy later. This was not South's mistake. Winning the opening lead in the South hand is 100% correct.|
pg| ***** 329 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|cs|1|at|
Declarer cashes the @SA next as both defenders follow small.

^-{^*UHint:^*N South has made better plays.}|
pg| ***** 330 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
A low spade is played towards dummy's @SQ for a finesse.|
pg| ***** 331 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
This time West follows suit with a small spade (he played the @SK at this juncture during the last sequence of plays).|
pg| ***** 332 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|at|
West might still have the @SK, of course, so declarer plays the @SQ from dummy.|
pg| ***** 333 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The alternative play of dummy's remaining low spade (instead of the @SQ) would not be very smart. The defense would win this trick with a low card and later capture dummy's @SQ with their @SK. Playing the @SQ is declarer's best chance for a second spade trick.|
pg| ***** 334 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|at|
On this deal, however, East is able to win the trick with the @SK. You might be thinking, "Well that's no big deal. Sometimes finesses lose. South still has the same 11 tricks he started with."|
pg| ***** 335 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|sk||at|
Losing this particular finesse ^*Iis^*N a big deal. Have a look at the defenders' remaining cards, especially the spades that East still has. East is on lead and he can win tricks with all 4 of his remaining spades. South will have no choice but to discard certain trick-winners as East runs his spades.|
pg| ***** 336 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East has already won a trick with the @SK and he will win 4 more tricks. East will win a total of 5 tricks in spades.|
pg| ***** 337 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South will be able to win the rest of the tricks when East is done, but the resulting total of 8 tricks for North-South will not be very satisfying - South could have won the first 11 tricks.|
pg| ***** 338 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Something has gone wrong. When West was dealt the @SK the successful finesse meant that North-South's 11 certain tricks became 12.|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
With the @SK in the East hand, however, the spade finesse lost and North-South's 11 certain tricks decreased to 8. Losing finesses are supposed to break even, but this one cost 3 tricks!|
pg| ***** 340 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|11|at|
Let's return to trick 1 again and look at South's correct play before trying to sort out what all of this means in the grand scheme of things.|
pg| ***** 341 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hq|at|
Declarer wins the opening lead with the @HQ, preserving dummy's @HA to win a future trick.

Here comes the big play...|
pg| ***** 342 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
Suppose declarer leads his small spade immediately (instead of playing the @SA first - the mistake that declarer made when we went through the play before).|
pg| ***** 343 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Leading the @S2 is not strictly correct from a card combination point of view. On this complete deal, however, the @S2 is a much better play than the @SA.|
pg| ***** 344 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
West follows with a small spade, but from South's point of view he could still have the @SK. Remember, in real bridge the declarer cannot see all 4 hands.|
pg| ***** 345 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|at|
Declarer therefore calls for the @SQ from the dummy. If West had been dealt the @SK, then this @SQ play would result in a twelfth trick for declarer as before.|
pg| ***** 346 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|at|
Unfortunately, East has the @SK. He captures dummy's @SQ and wins the trick.|
pg| ***** 347 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Does South just shut his eyes now as East wins the next 4 tricks with winning spades?

|
pg| ***** 348 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
No!!! South still has the @SA in his hand. If East returns a spade, South can win the @SA and take the remainder of the 11 tricks he was dealt.|
pg| ***** 349 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That's not as good as the 12 tricks that South won when the @SK was with West, but it's much better than the 8 tricks that South won when he took his @SA too early.|
pg| ***** 350 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|3|
md|0,sk,,s7|at|
Just to make sure you see that South could still win 2 spades tricks when West was dealt the @SK, let's give West that card and return to the critical point in the play. South has just led the @S2 from his hand without taking the @SA first.|
pg| ***** 351 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If West plays a low spade now, dummy's @SQ will be played and declarer will have a second spade trick (and 12 tricks in total).|
pg| ***** 352 ***** |


pc|sk|pc|s|pc|s|
nt|^z@3^b@2
West can make life more difficult for declarer by winning the trick with his @SK (as opposed to playing his low spade).|
pg| ***** 353 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ht|at|
West returns another heart and declarer is faced with yet another decision. Should he win the @HA in the dummy or the @HK in the South hand?|
pg| ***** 354 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|pc|h|pc|h|at|
It is correct for South to win this trick in his hand with the @HK. Watch what happens if dummy's @HA wins the trick instead.

|
pg| ***** 355 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose that declarer now tries to win a trick with the @SQ that he worked so hard to build into a winner. There is a problem. Do you see it?|
pg| ***** 356 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Declarer cannot win the next trick with the @SQ - the @SA will get in the way. The South hand contains just 1 spade now and it is the @SA. If the @SQ is played from North it will be wasted on the same trick as the @SA!|
pg| ***** 357 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
So declarer can do no better than to play a low spade from dummy to his @SA. The result is that the @SQ is stranded in dummy! Once again declarer made the mistake of winning a trick with the @HA before its proper time.|
pg| ***** 358 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's back up one more time, go through the whole sequence of plays, and finally get it right!|
pg| ***** 359 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|15|at|
We are back at trick 1 where West has played the @HJ as his opening lead.|
pg| ***** 360 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hq|at|
Declarer makes the first critical play of winning the lead in his hand (as opposed to with the @HA in the dummy).|
pg| ***** 361 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|sk|pc|s|pc|s|at|
South makes his second key play at trick 2. He leads the @S2 towards the @SQ without cashing the @SA first. The finesse succeeds as West wins the trick with his @SK.|
pg| ***** 362 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The mistake of cashing the @SA first would not cost on this layout, but it could have been expensive if East had been dealt the @SK instead of West.|
pg| ***** 363 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ht|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hK|at|
It appears there will be no easy tricks on this deal. West returns a heart at trick 3. In order to win 12 tricks South must take this trick in his hand, still saving the dummy's @HA for just the right moment.|
pg| ***** 364 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
The next big play for declarer is to win trick 4 with the @SA, clearing the way for the @SQ to win a later trick.|
pg| ***** 365 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|pc|c|at|
The proper time to win a trick with the @HA has come at last! Declarer would like the lead to be in the dummy so that the @SQ can win a trick.|
pg| ***** 366 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East discards on this trick, but that is not important. The important thing is that the lead is in the dummy at the perfect time - the time when the @SQ can be used to win a trick.|
pg| ***** 367 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|pc|s|pc|d|pc|d|at|
The @SQ wins trick 6 as South and West both discard diamonds.|
pg| ***** 368 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have won 5 tricks so far and South's 7 remaining cards will all win tricks as well. That's a total of 12 tricks for North-South - a suitable reward for South's excellent play as declarer.|
pg| ***** 369 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||at|
Before we get into the most important lesson that the deal we just saw has to offer, there are a few smaller (but still important) things to reflect on:

|
pg| ***** 370 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{On many deals you will have a choice between winning a trick in the declarer's hand
or the dummy's hand. Think ahead as to where you will want the lead to be later!}

^-In the deal we just saw, the declarer had 2 chances to win a heart trick in either the North or the South hand. It was important to win both of these tricks in the South hand so that North's @HA could be saved. The @HA was needed to access the @SQ. Declarer could not afford to use the @HA until the time was right.

|
pg| ***** 371 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{As declarer, consider the tricks you might lose in addition to the tricks you might win.}

^-If South had not considered the possibility of losing several spade tricks to East, he would have made the mistake of winning the @SA too early. Not only is the @SA a sure trick - it also prevents the defenders from winning any immediate tricks in spades. South must keep this card to control the spade suit.

|
pg| ***** 372 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{Bridge is not a game that is well suited to general rules of strategy. 
^*IHigh card from the short hand^*N, one of most reliable rules, was not right on this deal.}

^-^*IHigh card from the short hand^*N suggests playing the @SA on the first round of spades in the last deal. As we saw, that play is incorrect. Be careful whenever someone tries to sell you a universal rule for bridge strategy. You can always find a deal where any given ^*Irule^*N does not apply!|
pg| ***** 373 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ht|a|n#|5|cs|3|at|Consider the card combination at the center of the last deal:|
ht|c|at|^-{|ih|psq43|at|}

{|ih|psa2|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 374 ***** |


cs|1|at|Here is the most important lesson to be learned from this combination and from the deal in which we just saw it appear:

^-{The correct play for a particular card combination may not be the
correct play in a complete deal containing that card combination.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 375 ***** |


at|When we studied this card combination in isolation, we saw that the right play was to win a trick with the @SA first, just in case the @SK fell. On the deal we just saw, however, it was correct to lead the @S2 from the South hand at once. By placing this card combination in the context of a complete deal, the correct play in the spade suit changed.|
pg| ***** 376 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|The concept of breaking a deal down into 4 card combinations (1 for each suit) is a good one, but it does not always work. That's good news in a sense. If all there was to bridge was studying card combinations then bridge would not be a particularly interesting or challenging game. The fact that the correct play in one suit can be influenced by the other 3 suits is actually pretty cool.

|
pg| ***** 377 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{In bridge the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts!}
^-
|
pg| ***** 378 ***** |


at|That does not mean that your study of card combinations has been wasted. For one thing, on many deals the correct play in each suit in isolation is the same as it is when that suit is plugged into the whole deal. Also, the skills you have developed in your study of card combinations will prove invaluable in discovering situations in which the ^*Inormal play^*N of a suit is not correct.

When we study card combinations we do so ^*Iin a vacuum^*N. We assume that it is possible to transfer the lead between North and South as often as is necessary. We ignore the possibility of the defenders winning lots of tricks. An entire bridge deal is not a vacuum, however, and these factors are often critical when all 4 suits are considered together.

After winning the trick with the @SA or @SK, both of South's remaining spades will also score tricks. Now that the @SQ is gone there is nothing left that beats the @SJ. North-South win 3 tricks in total.|

Suppose that we back up and give East a chance to reconsider his play of the @SQ. North has led a small spade to trick 1 and it is East's turn to play again.|
pg| ***** 394 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
This time East tries a low spade instead of the @SQ. Remember that playing the @SQ made it easy for North-South to win all 3 tricks. Can you see how North-South can still win 3 tricks even if East plays a small spade?|
pg| ***** 395 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|at|
Playing the @SJ for a finesse will work very well (since East has the @SQ).|
pg| ***** 396 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
When West is unable to produce the @SQ (because it was dealt to East), South's @SJ wins trick 1. Both the @SA and @SK will win tricks as well. North-South, therefore, come to 3 spade tricks regardless of which spade East plays to the first trick.|
pg| ***** 397 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Did you notice that there is another way that North-South can play their cards and still manage to take a successful finesse? This plan is even better than the one we just tried.|
pg| ***** 398 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|2|at|
We are back at South's turn to play to the first trick. A small spade has been led from the North hand and East wisely plays a small spade, making South's task more difficult.|
pg| ***** 399 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have already seen how playing the @SJ here will result in a successful finesse and 3 tricks for North-South.|

Suppose that South decides to win the trick with the @SA or @SK instead.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Have a close look at the remaining position. It is very similar to something we have seen already.|
pg| ***** 402 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Now that the @SK has been played, the @SQ is the second highest spade and the @SJ is the third highest. If South's @SJ was the @SQ (which is normally the third highest spade) and East's @SQ was the @SK (which is normally the second highest spade) it would amount to the same thing.|
pg| ***** 403 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The above position is just like a finesse against a King - a play you know well.|
pg| ***** 404 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is still a finesse to be taken, but the lead is in the wrong hand to take the finesse. South won the first trick, but we would like the lead to the second trick to come from the North hand (opposite the critical @SJ).|
pg| ***** 405 ***** |

nt|^z@3^b@2
With card combinations this is never a problem. We can always say, "North regains the lead in some other suit." We are going to do that here.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
In an entire bridge deal it is not always so easy. We have already seen some deals where declarer must be careful to arrange the lead to be in the right hand at the right time.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s3|at|
So the lead is back in the North hand for the second trick in the spade suit. [^*BMM: Of course, it was done by playing another suit.^*n] North leads another spade towards the critical holding in South's hand.|
pg| ***** 408 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Playing the @SQ on the second trick will work just as badly for East as it did on the first trick. South would win this trick with the @SA and the third trick with the @SJ.|
pg| ***** 409 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|st|at|
It will come as no surprise that a low spade does not help matters for East, but at least it forces declarer to make a less obvious play.|

We are back at the point where South erred by finessing with the @SJ. North has led a small spade to the first trick and East has followed suit with a small card.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
The day is not looking as cruel anymore. West has no choice but to drop his @SQ as South wins the trick. Now that
the @SQ is gone the @SJ is sure to win a trick (as is the @SA, of course).|
pg| ***** 422 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If the @SQ had not conveniently fallen under the @SK, the finesse could still be taken on the second round (provided that the lead could be given to North in some other suit).|
pg| ***** 423 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|4|at|
North-South therefore end up with 3 tricks against this East-West spade distribution by refusing the first round finesse. South should play the @SA or the @SK first.|
pg| ***** 424 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On most days the @SQ will not fall under the @SA or @SK, but the finesse will still be available when North leads to the second spade trick.|

When North plays another spade, East follows suit with a low card.

Should South finesse the @SJ or play the @SA?|
pg| ***** 431 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this particular layout of the East-West cards South had better win the trick with the @SA. The @SQ will fall as the @SA wins the trick. The @SJ will complete the 3-trick sweep for North-South.|
pg| ***** 432 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If South finesses the @SJ instead of playing the @SA, East will win his @SQ, holding North-South to just 2 tricks in spades.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
If we move the @SQ over to East, however, the exact opposite is true. Finessing the @SJ will win and North-South will take 3 spade tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Playing the @SA will not work anymore. The @SQ will not drop and the @SJ will not win a trick. North-South will be held to 2 spade tricks on this layout if the @SA is played.|

Sure enough North's dummy contains 4 small cards in both spades and diamonds (along with some nice winners in the other suits). The North-South hands have 9 diamonds and 8 spades between them. Both of these suits are solid except for the missing Queens.|
pg| ***** 455 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
"8 ever, 9 never" tells us how both of these suits should be played.|
pg| ***** 456 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The North-South hands contain 8 spades between them. "8 ever" says we should plan to finesse in spades (after cashing either the @SA or the @SK first).

|
pg| ***** 457 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The North-South hands contain 9 diamonds between them. "9 never" tells us we should not plan to finesse in diamonds. The @DA and @DK should be played in the hope that the @DQ falls.|

West's opening lead of the @HQ is won with dummy's @HK.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
For the sake of this lesson it doesn't really matter whether declarer plays on spades or diamonds now. Let's play on spades, the suit in which we are supposed to take the finesse.|
pg| ***** 460 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|at|
So let's suppose that a spade is played from the dummy towards South's critical holding. East follows with a small spade. Does "8 ever" say that we should finesse here?|
pg| ***** 461 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sk|at|
"8 ever" does say we should finesse in spades. However, the finesse should not be taken on this trick. It is correct to win this trick with the @SA or @SK in case West was dealt the lone @SQ.|
pg| ***** 462 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
"8 ever" will be paid its proper respect. We will finesse in spades on a later trick. This trick should be used to see if there is a lone @SQ out there.|
pg| ***** 463 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
There are no miracles on this deal. West follows with a small spade.|
pg| ***** 464 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In order to continue our plan of taking a finesse in spades, we will have to place the lead back in the dummy (the hand opposite South's critical holding). |
pg| ***** 465 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Dummy has 3 certain immediate winners, the @HA, @CA, and @CK. Any one of these could be used to transfer the lead to the dummy. Any ideas as to which of dummy's high cards we should use?|
pg| ***** 466 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is correct to place the lead in dummy by winning a trick with either the @CA or the @CK.|
pg| ***** 467 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We are planning on finessing in spades. If West was dealt the @SQ, the finesse will lose and West will be on lead. Unless dummy can stop both hearts and clubs, East-West will be able to win several tricks. Dummy has 2 high cards in clubs but only 1 high card in hearts.|
pg| ***** 468 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|c|pc|c|pc|c|at|
By getting to dummy in clubs we are able to maintain a high card in dummy in both of the dangerous suits.|
pg| ***** 469 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|at|
Continuing with the plan, a low spade is led from the dummy. When East follows small it's time to put our faith in "8 ever" and finesse the @SJ (or @s10), hoping that East has the @SQ.|
pg| ***** 470 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|pc|h|at|
"8 ever" doesn't comes with any guarantees, of course, but on this deal it really comes through.|
pg| ***** 471 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The finesse of the @SJ wins the trick as West discards a heart. The fact that West discarded should make us pause for thought. How were the spades originally distributed?|
pg| ***** 472 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South were dealt 8 spades between them, leaving 5 for East-West. West followed suit once, but he discarded on the second round of spades. West began with just 1 of the 5 outstanding spades. That means East was dealt 4 spades (including the @SQ).|
pg| ***** 473 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
How many spades does East have left and what can we do about it?|
pg| ***** 474 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East started with 4 spades and he has followed suit twice already. He has 2 spades left, the @SQ and a small spade. If we play the @SA now, East will follow suit with his small spade and his @SQ will control the fourth round. That's not going to work. |
pg| ***** 475 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Can you see a way to neutralize East's @SQ?|
pg| ***** 476 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Remember how we saw that it was possible to repeat a finesse against an Ace or a King? It is also possible to repeat a finesse against a Queen.|
pg| ***** 477 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South's remaining spade holding has East's @SQ surrounded. Dummy still has some vital small cards to lead for the finesse and the lead can be placed in the dummy with the @HA or the @CA.|
pg| ***** 478 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In fact, the spade finesse that remains is one of the nicest kinds of finesse of them all. It is a finesse that is certain to work as we already know that East was dealt the @SQ. Bridge players refer to a finesse that is certain to work as a proven finesse.|
pg| ***** 479 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
So should we go over to the dummy and take the proven finesse in spades?|
pg| ***** 480 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It would actually be a mistake to finesse spades again now, even though we know that finesse is going to work. In order to see why we have look into the future.|
pg| ***** 481 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If we go to dummy now to repeat the spade finesse, we will have to use dummy's last high card in either hearts or clubs. That will set up several tricks for the defenders, tricks they will be able to win if they should gain the lead.|
pg| ***** 482 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is no longer any danger of the defenders gaining the lead in spades - the finesse in that suit is proven. It might still be necessary, however, to lose the lead in diamonds. "9 never" tells us the best way to play the diamonds, but again there are no guarantees.|
pg| ***** 483 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
So the time has come to play on diamonds. We can always take the proven spade finesse later. If we have to lose a diamond trick, however, we will be happy to still have the @HA and @CA in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 484 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|pc|d|pc|d|pc|d|at|
The @DK is played, but the @DQ does not drop. Should we go over to the dummy to finesse in diamonds?|
pg| ***** 485 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
No! We should not be taking any finesses in diamonds. We started with 9 diamonds between the North-South hands. "9 never" says we should not finesse in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 486 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Besides "9 never", the fact that travelling to the dummy for a finesse would create a major weakness in either hearts or clubs is another good reason not to finesse in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 487 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|da|pc|d|pc|d|pc|c|at|
When the @DA is played West follows with a small diamond and East discards a club. The @DQ is still missing. "9 never" has failed us!|
pg| ***** 488 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Actually the fact that we have to lose a trick to the @DQ has very little to do with "9 never". West was dealt enough small diamonds to go with his @DQ such that we could never drop that card.|
pg| ***** 489 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Also, because the @DQ was dealt ^*Iover^*N the @DAK there was no way that we could have finessed successfully in any case. On this deal there was no way to avoid a diamond loser.|
pg| ***** 490 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Do you know how the East-West diamonds were originally distributed?|
pg| ***** 491 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South began with 9 diamonds, leaving 4 for East-West. East's second round discard means that he started with 1 diamond. West, therefore, started with 3 diamonds (including the @DQ). West has followed suit twice so the @DQ is his only remaining diamond.|
pg| ***** 492 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is too bad that we have to lose a diamond trick, but something good will come of it. Once the @DQ is forced out, South's 2 remaining diamonds will be promoted into sure trick-winners. The time has come to let West win a trick with the @DQ.|
pg| ***** 493 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dj|pc|d|pc|d|pc|c|at|
West wins the @DQ as East discards another club.|
pg| ***** 494 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Now aren't you glad that dummy still has the @HA and the @CA?|
pg| ***** 495 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If you had played one of those cards earlier (say to get to the dummy to take a second spade finesse) the defenders would now be in a position to win several tricks.|
pg| ***** 496 ***** |


pc|hj|pc|ha|pc|h|pc|h|
nt|^z@3^b@2
As it is, West can do no better than to lead another heart. Dummy's @HA wins the trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
The lead is in the dummy again, making it a convenient time to take the proven finesse in spades. There is no reason to worry about West winning the @SQ and then winning some heart tricks. We already know that East still has the @SQ - that's what makes the finesse proven!|
pg| ***** 498 ***** |

Sorry to disappoint you, but there are other situations as well where it is correct to go against "9 never" and finesse in a suit that contains 9 cards missing the Queen. There are also some situations where "8 ever" should be ignored by cashing both the Ace and King in an 8-card suit missing the Queen.

It has already been mentioned that bridge is like that - there are no magic rules that will always tell you which cards to play.

"8 ever, 9 never" is a good bridge rule because it offers correct advice to declarer on ^*Imost^*N deals. It is a good idea for you to learn these sorts of strategy rules for bridge, even if they are flawed. Just make sure you don't rely blindly on such rules. Always double check by thinking about the whole deal. Before playing a card simply because a rule told you to do so, ask yourself, "what will happen next?"

North-South have been dealt the card combination we have been discussing and the 7 remaining spades have been given to East-West. This particular layout of the East-West cards clearly illustrates why leading the @SJ from North is another example of a pseudo-finesse.|

pg| ***** 525 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sq|at|
This time East properly covers the @SJ with the @SQ. South obviously can't play the @S2 here. East's @SQ would win the trick holding North-South to just the 2 certain tricks that they were dealt.|

South therefore wins the trick with the @SA or @SK as West follows suit.|
pg| ***** 527 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Unfortunately, it is now impossible for North-South to win both of the last 2 tricks. The @SA will win a trick, of course, but West has all of the good middle spades. South's @S2 and North's @S43 cannot compete with West's strong spade cards. It would not make a difference if the remaining spades were divided in some other way between the East and West hands.
|
pg| ***** 528 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|4|at|
The bottom line is that leading the @SJ from North will never result in a third spade trick for North-South (as long as East covers with the @SQ whenever he is dealt that card).|
pg| ***** 529 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Recall, however, that there is more than 1 way to win a trick with a Jack when the Queen is missing. There is no real finesse with this combination, but playing for the @SQ to drop under the @SA and @SK might work.|
pg| ***** 530 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
Since leading the @SJ cannot possibly gain a trick, suppose that North leads a small spade instead.|
pg| ***** 531 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|sk|pc|s|at|
East follows with a small spade and South wins the trick with the @SK (or @SA) as West also follows small.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
South continues by cashing the @SA and he is rewarded for his good play when the @SQ comes tumbling down from the East hand.

nt|^z@3^b@2
North's @SJ is the highest remaining spade and it will, therefore, win the third trick. North-South win all 3 tricks by playing for the drop instead of the finesse.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||cs|3|n#|5|at|So it is possible for North-South to win 3 tricks with:|
ht|c|at|^D{|ih|psJ43|at|}

but not by taking a finesse. This combination does not contain any genuine finessing possibilities. The @SA and @SK should be cashed in the hope that the @SQ drops. Note that this advice does not contradict "8 ever". "8 ever, 9 never" only applies when the Queen is the ^*Ionly^*N relevant missing card. When the Jack is dealt opposite the Ace and King the Ten becomes a relevant card as well. The defenders also hold the @S10 so "8 ever" does not apply here.

On many bridge deals the declarer might as well toss a coin to decide which way to take a 2-way finesse. On some deals, however, there are strong clues that point to which defender rates to have the missing Queen.|
pg| ***** 596 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dj|at|
West's opening lead is the @DJ.|
PG| ***** 597 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That looks like a lucky break. We are much stronger in diamonds than we are in hearts. An opening heart lead would not have been welcome.|
pg| ***** 598 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is a legitmate 2-way finesse against the @SQ since the @SA and @SK are split between the North-South hands and the @SJ and @S10 are also present. It does not matter that the @SJ and the @S10 are in the same hand.|
pg| ***** 599 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The club suit also appears to contain a 2-way finesse. The @CQ is the only missing high club and the @CA and the @CK are split. There's something about that club suit, however, that should give you pause for thought.
|
pg| ***** 600 ***** |


cs|1|at|
^-{9 never!}|
pg| ***** 601 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That's right, even though we could finesse either defender for the @CQ, we should not finesse in clubs at all. Notice that there are 9 clubs between the North-South hands.|
PG| ***** 602 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
"9 never" says that when there are 9 or more cards between the 2 hands both the Ace and King should be cashed. It doesn't matter if a 2-way finesse is present. "9 never" still applies.|
pg| ***** 603 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|pc|d|pc|d|at|
So, after winning the opening diamond lead, we should plan not to take any finesses in clubs.|
pg| ***** 604 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
We still have to decide which suit to play first. Clubs is the logical choice - even if we have to lose a trick to the @CQ, it still will be possible to develop 2 more tricks in clubs. The spade suit, where North and South both hold 3 cards, has potential for just 1 extra trick.|
pg| ***** 605 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|c|pc|ca|at|
Suppose, that we decide to start by playing a club to the @CA in the dummy. Something good is about to happen...|
pg| ***** 606 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cq|at|
East follows suit with the @CQ! |
PG| ***** 607 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
See - sometimes lone Queens really do get dealt. East's @CQ is obviously the only club that East was dealt. If East had been dealt another club, it would have to be smaller than the @CQ - East would not have wasted his @CQ under dummy's @CA.|
pg| ***** 608 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Even though spades is the only suit remaining in which it might be possible to develop an extra trick, there is no rush to play the spades.|
PG| ***** 609 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Eventually, we are going to have to guess which defender was dealt the @SQ. By postponing our decision as long as possible, we may be able to uncover some helpful clues.|
pg| ***** 610 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|cj|pc|h6|pc|c8|pc|c5|at|
So we might as well finish taking our club tricks. The order in which the clubs are played is not important. Suppose we win the second round of clubs with the @CJ.|
PG| ***** 611 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East's discard was expected - we knew he was dealt just 1 club when he played the @CQ on the previous trick.|
pg| ***** 612 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c2|pc|ht|pc|c9|pc|c6|at|
We decide to show off a bit on the next round of clubs, winning the trick with @C9 in the South hand.|
PG| ***** 613 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West follows suit (for the third and final time - you know he started with 3 of the 4 outstanding clubs) while East discards another heart.|
pg| ***** 614 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ck|pc|d6|pc|c3|pc|s5|at|
South's @CK wins the next trick. West discards a diamond and East discards a spade.|
pg| ***** 615 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|d|at|
When the @C10 is led West discards another diamond. Dummy must also discard.|
PG| ***** 616 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
As we have seen, all of dummy's spades are important, but the low hearts and diamonds in dummy are not going to win any tricks. We should definitely discard from one of these suits (it doesn't matter which one).|
pg| ***** 617 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|
nt|^z@3^b@2
We decide to discard one of dummy's small hearts and East also discards from that suit as South's @C10 wins the trick.|
pg| ***** 618 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
So far so good, but we are now out of clubs. Has the time come to try to guess the @SQ? Remember, we were trying to postpone that decision for as long as we could safely do so.|
pg| ***** 619 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Well, we could postpone our spade decision by 3 more tricks if we wanted to. The @HA, @DA, and @DK remain as certain trick-winners outside of the spade suit. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to play all of these winners now. 
^^Can you see why?|
pg| ***** 620 ***** |


at|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|^-{ Hint: Use the force }|
pg| ***** 621 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That wasn't really a very good hint. What you should do is look into the future. Suppose we now win tricks with the @HA, @DA, and @DK and then try to guess who has the @SQ. By winning tricks with these high cards in our short suits we will be setting up tricks in the defenders' hands. |
pg| ***** 622 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If we happen to be wrong in our guess for the @SQ we will lose the lead to that card. The defender who wins the @SQ may be in a position to win another trick.|
pg| ***** 623 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is important to retain a high card that can win a trick in both hearts and diamonds. If we play the @HA and top diamonds now, the defenders will be able to win another trick if we happen to finesse the wrong way in spades. It is certainly not safe to postpone the spade decision for another 3 tricks.|
pg| ***** 624 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
Notice, however, that we still have 2 high cards in diamonds, the @DA and @DK. We can afford to cash one of these winners as we will still have a card left that can stop the defenders from winning diamond tricks. |
pg| ***** 625 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We can safely postpone our spade decision by 1 more trick. We cannot afford the luxury of winning any heart tricks now as we only have 1 high heart, the @HA.|
pg| ***** 626 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|pc|d|pc|d|
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
Suppose that we decide to win a trick with the @DK before tackling the spades. West and North both follow suit. Watch carefully - East is about to provide us with a critical clue!|
pg| ***** 627 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
East discards the @S6. What's the big deal about that?

|
pg| ***** 628 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The big deal is we now know that East was originally dealt just 1 diamond. Here's how:|
pg| ***** 629 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East followed suit to the opening diamond lead and he did not discard any diamonds when we ran our clubs (yes, you should try to pay attention to what the defenders discard). East discarded on the second round of diamonds so we know that he must have been dealt only 1 diamond.|
pg| ***** 630 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
North-South began with 6 diamonds (3 in each hand). Of the 7 remaining diamonds in the deck, East was dealt 1 diamond, leaving West with an original holding of 6 diamonds.|
pg| ***** 631 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Do you remember how the clubs were originally distributed around the table?|
pg| ***** 632 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South started with 9 clubs between them (5 with South and 4 with North), leaving 4 clubs for East-West. East was dealt just 1 club, the @CQ, leaving 3 clubs for West.|
pg| ***** 633 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We know that West was dealt 6 diamonds and 3 clubs and that East was dealt 1 diamond and 1 club. Can you see how that information might help you find the @SQ?|
pg| ***** 634 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Each defender started the deal with 13 cards. West was dealt 6 diamonds and 3 clubs, leaving room for just 4 cards in hearts and spades. East, however, was dealt only 1 diamond and 1 club, leaving room for 11 cards in hearts and spades. |
pg| ***** 635 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East, therefore, was dealt 7 more cards than West that ^*Icould be^*N the @SQ. The odds are very good that East was dealt the @SQ. We should resolve the 2-way finesse in spades by finessing through East. Remember how?|
pg| ***** 636 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|s|pc|sa|pc|s|at|
We start by playing a spade to the @SA in dummy as both defenders follow suit with small spades.|
pg| ***** 637 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The lead is now in the right hand (North's) for the finesse against East's hoped for @SQ.|
pg| ***** 638 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|at|
The @SJ (or @S10) is played from dummy.|
pg| ***** 639 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
When East follows with a low spade, we follow through with our plan.|
pg| ***** 640 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
A low spade is played from the South hand, in the hope that East was dealt the @SQ.|
pg| ***** 641 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|at|
West discards and the finesse wins!

|
pg| ***** 642 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{  Finesse - nice guess!  }|
pg| ***** 643 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have won the first 9 tricks and 3 of South's 4 remaining cards, the @SK, @HA, and @DA, will also win tricks. That's 12 tricks in all for North-South.|
PG| ***** 644 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is nothing that can be done about the losing @H2, so winning all 13 tricks was never possible. Be happy with 12 tricks - we played very well to win that many.|

Have a look at how the cards were originally dealt. |
pg| ***** 646 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Note the diamond and club suits in particular. West was dealt so many cards in these suits that there is not much room left for the @SQ. East, with only 2 cards between these suits, had much more space left for the @SQ in his hand than his partner did.|
pg| ***** 647 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We waited as long as possible before deciding which defender to finesse for the @SQ. By doing so, we were able to discover some valuable information - how clubs and diamonds were originally divided between the East-West hands. |
pg| ***** 648 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That information was enough to tip off the likely location of the @SQ. The @SQ was by no means guaranteed to be with East, but it was highly likely once the diamond and club information came to light.|
pg| ***** 649 ***** |

Also remember another lesson we learned from this deal:

^-{If a 9-card (or longer) suit contains a 2-way finesse for the Queen, "9 never" still applies.
We had a 2-way finesse for the @CQ, but we correctly planned not to finesse in clubs at all.}|
pg| ***** 652 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|
The club suit on this deal also reinforced something we have seen before:

^-{It is generally correct to try to establish extra tricks in your longest suits first.
Sometimes the lead has to be lost, but small cards in long suits will often become winners.}|
pg| ***** 653 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
Remember how we said we were lucky that West chose diamonds (instead of hearts) for his opening lead? Did West make a mistake here? |
pg| ***** 654 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
No, West's opening lead did not work out, but it was not a mistake. West had no way of knowing that his partner was so strong in hearts. West could see only his own 13 cards.|
pg| ***** 655 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|
Here is the lesson we can learn from this:

^-{Making good opening leads is one of the hardest parts of bridge. Here is the main reason:

The position of the @CK and the 2-2 diamond break mean that North-South can win all 13 tricks with proper play. |

nt|^z@3^b@2
Now turn your attention to the diamond suit where North-South have 9 combined cards missing only the @DQ. 9 never applies so you should plan not to take any finesses in diamonds. The @DK and @DA should be played in the hope that the @DQ falls.|
pg| ***** 741 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @DK, the ^*Ihigh card from the short hand^*N, should come first. |

9 never tells us to play the @DA on the next trick, refusing the finesse. |

nt|^z@3^b@2
When the @DQ falls the rest of South's diamonds are all winners. Those tricks should be taken at once as the lead will never be in the South hand again. Dummy has 5 small cards in hearts and spades to discard on South's 5 diamonds. |

These cards remain after all of the diamonds have been played.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
The time has come to finesse West for the @CK, but care is required. It is correct to start clubs by leading the @CJ so that the lead can remain in the South hand for a second finesse. |

West withholds his @CK (it would not help him to cover with the @CK) and the @CJ wins the trick. The lead is still in the South hand so a second club finesse can be taken. |

nt|^z@3^b@2
There are 8 hearts between the North-South hands missing only the @HQ.  8 ever suggests that we finesse against
the @HQ.   Since the @HA and the @HK are divided there is a 2-way finesse in hearts - either defender can be finessed for the @HQ. |
PG| ***** 763 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have to decide whether East or West is more likely to have been dealt that card. We got our first clue at trick 1 when we found out that West was dealt all 6 of the outstanding spades.|
pg| ***** 764 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There are 2 reasons why it is a good idea to win 4 club tricks at once. First, this will help us learn more about the East-West hands. |
PG| ***** 765 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Second, if we were to take an immediate losing finesse in hearts, the defenders might be able to win so many tricks that we would never get any club tricks at all. |

Both defenders follow suit to the first 3 rounds of clubs. They both discard a diamond on the fourth round of clubs. East and West were therefore both dealt 3 cards in clubs.|
pg| ***** 771 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The decision about the @HQ cannot be put off any longer. West is known to have started with 6 spades and 3 clubs, 9 cards in all - he has only 4 cards that could be the @HQ. |
PG| ***** 772 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East is known to have started with 3 cards in spades and clubs (all of them clubs). That leaves 10 cards that could have been the @HQ. The odds say that the @HQ rates to be with East since he has so much more space in his hand for that card.|
pg| ***** 773 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since the plan is to finesse East for the @HQ, start the hearts by playing to the @HK in dummy. |

Continue with the @HJ so that the lead can stay in the dummy if the finesse needs to be repeated. |

That precaution proves wise when West discards. East's @HQ is still guarded, but the lead is in the right hand for a second finesse. |
