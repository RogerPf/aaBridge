^-{  Introduction and example deal 1 - The power of a trump suit  }
^-|fp||at|
Bridge is not the only trick-taking card game that uses a trump suit. If you have played games like euchre or spades, you already know quite a bit about the concept of trumps.

Even if you haven't played these games, you have heard the word trump before. Outside the world of cards you might hear someone say, "That's my trump card," to refer to a possession of great power or importance.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|^^
That's exactly what the trump suit is in bridge - a suit of great power and importance. The bidding of a bridge deal determines which (if any) of the 4 suits will be the trump suit for that deal. The presence of a trump suit greatly influences the play of the cards and declarer's strategies for winning as many tricks as possible.

|cs|1|at|^-{Having lots of cards in the trump suit is a very good thing. The more 
trump cards the partnership holds, the more tricks they are likely to win.}

^-The bridge deals that we have seen so far did not contain a trump suit. In bridge we say that these deals were played in notrump. We are about to see a deal in which there is a trump suit. The trump suit for this deal is spades. The deal itself is not very realistic, but it is an example of just how powerful a trump suit can be.|

We can see that spades are trump on this deal. North-South are lucky enough to have all 13 trumps between their 2 hands!|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West, meanwhile, has been dealt a remarkable bridge hand. His 13 cards consist of 2 4-card solid suits (diamonds and clubs) plus a 5-card solid suit (hearts). It looks like West will be able to win all 13 tricks without breathing hard.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
As you will see, however, the fact that spades are trump makes a dramatic difference to the trick-winning prospects of North-South and East-West. It doesn't matter which card West chooses for the opening lead. If West has any sense of the aesthetics of bridge, he will certainly choose the @H10.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ht|at|
Doesn't the rest of West's hand look pretty now that the @H10 is gone?

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
In ^*b face-to-face ^*n bridge dummy lays down his spades on the left. This is no accident.

|at|^-{It is traditional that dummy's trumps are layed down as the leftmost suit. 
When there is no trump suit, the dummy may arrange the suits as he sees fit.}|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cm||pc|h2|pc|h6|at|
The dummy and East both follow suit and it is South's turn to play. South doesn't have any hearts so he will have to find a discard. From what we have learned so far about bridge a discard can never win a trick. Suppose, however, that South chooses to discard a trump (remember, spades are trump). Watch what happens...|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|
nt|^z@3^b@2
That's right - South won the trick even though he discarded. How is that possible?
^^|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{If a card from the trump suit is discarded, it can win the trick. Even the lowly
Two of the trump suit ranks higher than the Ace of one of the other suits!}|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South's @S8 won trick 1 because spades are trump. West's @H10 would have won the trick if there was no trump suit. Since spades are trump on this deal, however, any spade that is played to a trick will beat any non-spade card.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|
The presence of a trump suit does not change any other ^*Ibasic bridge rules^*N that we learned.
^^^-{Even if a deal has a trump suit, the players must follow suit to a trick if they can. North
could not have won the first trick by playing a trump - he had to follow suit with a heart.}|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|
Some trick-taking card games have rules that force players to trump in certain situations. Bridge does not have any rules along these lines.

^-{Players are not forced to play a trump if they cannot follow suit. They are
free to discard from another suit if they wish (but they won't win the trick).}|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South, therefore, could have discarded a diamond (instead of a trump) on the first trick if he thought that was a good idea. South would have lost the first trick in that case to West's @H10. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this particular deal it would not have been smart for South to discard a diamond at trick 1. There are bridge deals, however, where declarer's correct strategy is to discard a non-trump even though a trump discard would win the trick.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|tc|r|at|
So South has won the first trick by trumping West's heart lead. Let's have a look at North-South's trick-winning prospects. South still has 6 solid spades in his hand. He could win the next 6 tricks by leading out his spades, 1 by 1.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South will win the first 7 tricks, but once their trumps are all gone there is no way that North-South will be able to win any more tricks. Can you see any way for North-South to win more than 7 tricks?|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|at|
Suppose South leads a diamond from his hand.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|da|at|
West's diamonds are all equals. Suppose he decides to play his @DA to the second trick. Is there any way that North-South can meet this challenge and win the trick?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|at|
Well the dummy wasn't dealt any diamonds - the declarer must decide on a discard from the dummy. When declarer chooses to discard the @S2 from dummy, the power of having a trump suit really comes to light.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|at|
East follows suit and the dummy wins the trick with the @S2! Even though West followed suit with the @DA, the @S2 was high enough to win the trick because spades are trump. Any trump card will beat any non-trump card in the battle for winning a trick.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|pc|c|at|
Declarer continues with a club (or heart) lead from dummy and East follows suit.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s|pc|ca|at|
South discards a trump and wins the trick as West, in frustration, follows suit with his @CA. All of West's clubs are equals so it doesn't matter which club he plays. How frustrating for West that none of his beautiful high clubs can win the trick once South has played a trump!|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Declarer will spend the next several tricks in this fashion, trumping South's diamonds in the dummy and trumping North's hearts and clubs in declarer's hand. Watch...|

East is also out of diamonds by this time and therefore has to discard. If East had been dealt any trumps higher than dummy's @S5 he could overtrump and win the trick. Alas, East has no spades at all, so he must discard from another suit (and therefore cannot win the trick).|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|at|
East chooses to discard a club and the dummy's @S5 wins trick 8.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|s|pc|h|at|
Declarer leads a heart from the dummy to trick 9 and wins the trick by trumping in the South hand. Do you notice anything unusual about the remaining position?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
What's unusual is that South is the only player with diamonds remaining. South has already led diamonds 4 times, trumping each time in the dummy. All of the defenders'^*N diamonds were exhausted in the process. South's remaining diamonds have become winners in their own right!|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d6|at|
When South leads the @D6, West must find a discard. West doesn't have any trumps to discard so there is no way he can win this trick.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|at|
West chooses to discard a club and it is dummy's turn to play. The dummy could win this trick by playing a trump, but there is no need - South's @D6 is capable of winning the trick without any help from the dummy.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|c|at|
Declarer chooses to discard a heart from the dummy and East (who must really wish he had been dealt a spade) also discards. South's @D6 wins trick 10.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|pc|h|pc|c|pc|c|at|
The next trick is similar. The @D7 is the last remaining diamond and it wins the trick as the other 3 players discard (once again North could win this trick by playing a trump).|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Declarer's last 2 cards are the @SA and @SK. Since spades are trump these 2 cards are the best 2 cards in the deck. The Ace of trumps must always win a trick. If the King of trumps is in the same hand as the trump Ace (as in this deal) it will always win a trick as well.

|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South, therefore, win all 13 tricks! What a great advertisement for the power of trumps!|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|
md|sakqjt98d765432,hakqjtdakqjcakqj,s765432h5432c432|mb|7s|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|at|
Let's have another look at all 52 cards of this deal. Notice, in particular, that North-South were dealt all 13 cards in the trump suit.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since North has no diamonds and South has no clubs or hearts, North-South can win all 13 tricks by trumping back and forth between the 2 hands. This procedure was not completely necessary as South's diamonds eventually became established as winners.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Notice that West has all the high cards in the deck outside of spades. He would win the first 13 tricks at notrump, but he is unable to win a single trick when spades are trump!|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You should know that this is a highly unusual bridge deal. Hands like South's (with cards in just 2 suits) and West's (with so many high cards) are extremely rare. Even the notion of one partnership being dealt all 13 trumps is something you don't see very often.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
Despite the fact that you are unlikely ever to see a bridge deal quite like this one when you are really playing, this deal vividly shows what trumps can do:|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^
^-{Having lots of trumps between the partnership usually translates into 
lots of tricks, even more so when there are lots of short suits about.}|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We have seen deals in which low cards in long suits can be established as tricks. This deal illustrates that short suits can also be an asset. Here North has a short suit in diamonds and South is short in both hearts and clubs. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The result is that the defenders cannot win any tricks in these suits - declarer will simply discard a trump from the appropriate hand.|

^-{Trump Terminology}
^-
There are several useful words that bridge players use to describe plays involving the trump suit. The word trump itself can be used as either a noun, "I have lots of trump," or a verb, "I trumped West's lead in the dummy." The word ruff is often used instead of trump, "I ruffed West's lead in the dummy." We will soon see that there are also overruffs and underruffs in bridge.

|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|The 3 other suits (besides the trump suit) are referred so as side suits or off suits.  The deal we just saw is an example of a trick-taking technique known as a crossruff. In a crossruff ^*Ndeclarer^*N alternates between ruffing side suit cards in the dummy and in his own hand. We will have a closer look at the crossruff later in this chapter.

|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


at|There are also some useful bridge terms for describing various ^*Ishort holdings^*N that a player might be dealt in a suit. When a player is dealt no cards at all in a particular suit he is said to be void in that suit. North had a diamond void on the previous deal, while South was void in both hearts and clubs. 

Being dealt just 1 card in a suit is referred to as being dealt a singleton in that suit, while a 2-card holding in a suit is known as a doubleton. "I was dealt a singleton diamond and a doubleton heart," is an example of how these terms are used.

|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


cs|2|at|If you think that it is not important to learn these bridge terms, consider this:

^-{Having names for various bridge situations and techniques is useful. Learning names makes
it easier to recognize situations and apply the right techniques when you are playing bridge.}
|

nt|^z@3^b@2
The concept of the trump suit opens up a new world of possibilities as far as winning tricks is concerned. The best way to appreciate what a trump suit can do is to see it in action. Most of this chapter will consist of bridge deals in which the trump suit plays a starring role. Before we start, let's review what we have learned about the trump suit so far:

You are free to discard whatever you want. You do not have to ruff.}

can lead trump at any time. You must follow suit if you can when trump is led.}

West is able to overruff and win the trick. Unlike some trick-taking games you are not obligated to overruff at bridge. West was allowed to discard from another suit if he wanted to, but overruffing was a good idea on this particular trick! The next trick will be especially demoralizing...|

North-South will be able to win the last 7 tricks (for a total of 8 tricks). South can ruff East's next diamond return without fear of being overruffed again - the defenders are out of trump. Dummy has the @CA to take care of South's @C2.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Not to take anything away from the defenders, who really played some great bridge there, but we could have done much better as declarer. Remember, we won only 7 tricks in our first try.|

Let's back up to the point where we had our first chance to ruff.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up||up||up||up||up||up||up||at|
East has just led a diamond and the South hand is void. The last time we were in this position we ruffed with the @H2 and West overruffed with the @HJ to win the trick.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose that we decide to ruff with the @HA instead of the @H2. Nothing beats the Ace of trump so we don't have to worry about getting overruffed on this trick.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West could, of course, choose to underruff with his @HJ. However, It is usually a bad idea to underruff. Save your trumps for later and discard from another suit if you cannot overruff.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|
nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c6|pc|d4|at|
On this deal it wouldn't actually hurt West to underruff, but he wisely chooses to discard instead, hoping that the @HJ might win a future trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Can you see how we can play to make sure there are no future tricks for the defenders?|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We should try to get rid of those pesky trumps in the defenders' hands. They keep using their trumps to kill the tricks we were hoping to win. It's time to put a stop to it!|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hk|pc|h|at|
We play a heart from our hand and win the trick with dummy's @HK. The defenders are now out of trump and there is no way they will be able to win another trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have won 3 tricks already and there are 6 tricks remaining. The 9 trick total we came to this time is quite an improvement over the 7 tricks we won before!|

The concept of drawing the defenders'^*N trumps by leading high trumps is a good one. If we had realized this earlier we would have been able to win even more tricks.|

Suppose, after winning the first trick, we decided to draw the defenders'^*N trump immediately. Last time we tried to develop spade tricks at once and the defenders were able to crossruff several tricks.|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Neither defender was dealt more than 3 hearts so our @HA, @HK, and @HQ will be good enough to draw all the trump. Any idea which of these cards should win the next trick?|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal it is unlikely to matter where the first heart trick is won. You might as well get into the habit of playing the ^*Ihigh card from the short hand^*N. This principle we learned about earlier often applies to the trump suit. What does the principle imply on this deal?|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hk|pc|h|at|
The North hand (with only 2 hearts) is clearly much shorter than the South hand (with 6 hearts). We should win the first heart trick with dummy's @HK, ^*Ithe high card from the short hand^*N.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Both defenders follow suit with small hearts. It is a good idea to try to count the defenders'^*N cards when drawing trump. That's 2 so far.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hq|pc|h|at|
We continue the process of drawing trump. Both defenders follow again (that's 4 trumps they have played) as South's @HQ wins (the @HA would do just as well - now that the @HK is gone the @HA and @HQ are equals).|

Now that the defenders'^*N trump supply has been exhausted, it is time to work on developing some tricks in the side suits. The spade suit has great potential so the @SK is played to force out the @SA.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
North-South have won 5 tricks already and they will have no trouble winning the 7 remaining tricks. That's 12 tricks in total and a major victory for drawing trump!|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|24|at|
Have a look at all 52 cards. This deal provides many important lessons about trumps.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Start with West's choice of opening lead - his singleton @DJ.|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^
^-{ A side suit singleton is an attractive opening lead when there is a trump suit. }
^-|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Once West led his singleton diamond, he was left with a void in that suit. West was thus in a position to ruff subsequent diamond leads. |
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this particular deal declarer could counter the singleton lead by drawing trump, but the concept of the singleton lead is still a good one.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
Remember when we saw that long suit opening leads (such as a club by West on this deal) tended to work well when the deal was played in notrump ?  That remains true.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^
^-{Leading your longest suit is frequently the best start at notrump, but consider
a short suit lead when there is a trump suit - you may win later tricks with ruffs.}^-|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs||at|
While we are on the subject of opening leads, consider what might happen if West chose to lead his @SA instead of his singleton diamond. Remember that we frowned on leads of an Ace when there was no trump suit (except from a solid suit, of course).|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|at|
West tries the @SA as his opening lead and the other 3 players follow suit. At first glance it looks like West has done us a favor by setting up 3 spade tricks in the South hand.|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Did you notice that East was dealt a singleton spade and that he is now void? West is not doing us any favors!|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|s9|pc|s|pc|h|pc|s|at|
When West plays a second round of spades, East ruffs to win the trick. Declarer will be able to win the rest of the tricks (as long as he draws trump) regardless of what East returns. East has no way to get his partner back on lead for another spade play.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The defenders win the first 2 tricks, but South can win the remaining 11 tricks. 11 tricks is very good, but not quite as good as the 12 tricks that declarer could win after a diamond opening lead.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The @SA is the best lead for West on this particular deal.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|8|at|
Despite the fact that the @SA works best on this particular deal, the singleton diamond lead is still recommended. |
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Although leading an Ace is slightly more attractive when there is a trump suit (your partner may have a singleton in that suit and be able to get a ruff) than where there is no trump suit, it is still best to avoid leading Aces.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|
Experience suggests that an opening lead of an unsupported Ace will tend to lose a trick more often than it will gain a trick, even when there is a trump suit.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


cs|4|at|^^^^^-{Even with a trump suit, the opening lead of an unsupported Ace should be avoided.
The @SA lead worked well here, but most often such leads will turn out to be poor choices.}
|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|at|
This deal also provided our first look at overruffing and underruffing. Overruffing is usually a recommended play while underruffing is usually not wise (discard from a side suit instead).|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^^^^-{Players are permitted to (but do not have to) overruff or underruff if they can't follow suit.
Overruffing tends to be a good idea while underruffing tends to be a waste of a trump.}^-|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|
Another lesson of this deal is that trumps can be a valuable weapon for the defenders as well as for the declarer. The defenders crossruffed several tricks when the declarer was not careful.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^^^-{Both partnerships can use the trump suit to win extra tricks. The defenders should try
to make the most of the trumps they were dealt and the declarer should try to stop them.}^-|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|at|
The best way for the declarer to neutralize the defenders' trumps is to draw them. On many deals with a trump suit, drawing the defenders'^*N trumps should be declarer's primary goal. |
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Indeed, drawing the defenders' trumps is the most important lesson of this deal.|

Even though the @DA is missing, our trump suit is very strong. The Ace of trump is always a natural trump trick, but we can force out that card. South's remaining trumps should then be sufficient to draw the rest of the defenders'^*N trump. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Drawing trumps worked well on the last deal as it prevented the defenders from winning tricks with ruffs. Let's see how drawing trump works on this deal.|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|pc|d|pc|d|pc|da|at|
We lead the @DK in an attempt to drive out the Ace of trump. The attempt succeeds when East wins his @DA and West follows suit.|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Remember, we are going to try to make a habit of counting the defenders' trumps. They started with 5 trumps between them and we just saw 2 of these cards get played.|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|sj|at|
When East returns the @SJ we are in a position to ruff again. Is there any danger that West is out of spades and will be able to overruff and win the trick?|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If you have been paying very close attention you will know that West is now void of spades. There were originally 2 spades in the South hand and 4 spades in the dummy. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That left 7 spades for the defenders. Both defenders played spades on each of the first 3 tricks. That accounts for 6 of the defenders'^*N spades and East's @SJ is the seventh. West is certainly out of spades.|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It takes a bit of work to realize that West is now void of spades. It takes less work to realize that there is no danger of an overruff.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South's original trumps were completely solid except for the @DA. Now that the @DA is gone, there are no diamonds left that can overruff any of South's diamonds (which are all equals).|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|pc|h|pc|s|at|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dq|pc|h|at|
Continuing with our plan of drawing trump, we lead the @DQ and West discards another heart.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |

The trumps appear to have been distributed unevenly between East and West. How many trumps does East have left and will they represent a problem?|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Remember that we started with 8 diamonds between the North-South hands, leaving 5 diamonds for the defenders. We have seen 2 of these cards already so East has 3 diamonds left.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This should not pose a problem. East will have to follow suit to this trick and South's 2 remaining diamonds will draw the rest of East's trumps.|

Fortunately, that is not really a problem. We are now free to cash our high clubs and hearts without fearing a ruff. We won't be able to win a trick with the @H2, but 4 more tricks are certain. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |

the @SA an excellent opening lead.|

PG| ***** 175 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal South has 4 obvious losers, his 2 small spades, the missing @DA, and the @H2. Can you see any way to turn one of these 4 losers into a tenth trick-winner?|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is nothing that can be done about the @DA - the Ace of trump is always a natural trump trick. Our spade losers are unavoidable as well. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
All we can do is follow suit as the defenders win the first 2 spade tricks. How about that @H2? Does that card have to lose a trick?|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Have a look at the North-South hearts. Dummy has a small doubleton heart and declarer has the @HA, @HK, and @H2. Does the fact that dummy is relatively short in hearts give you any ideas?

|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|
Once the @HA and @HK are played, dummy will be void in hearts. South will then be free to lead the @H2 and ruff it in the dummy. In this way, the @H2 might not lose a trick after all.|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
One problem with this plan is that it will mean not drawing trump at once. Drawing the defenders' trumps will also remove the trumps from the dummy - that will make it hard to take any ruffs in the dummy!|

We are back at the dummy's turn to play. It sure looks like we can afford to ruff with the @D7 - it is not like this card is going to win a later trick. |
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Superficially, it looks like this play shouldn't matter as East can overruff the @D7 (as he did when we ruffed with the @D2).|
pg| ***** 200 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d7|at|
It is East's turn to play and he certainly can overruff the @D7. The only trump he has that can beat dummy's @D7, however, is the @DA.|

Suppose that East decides to overruff with the @DA, winning a third trick for the defenders.|
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Well the @DA was always going to win a trick and that was a good trick for it to win (at least as far as North-South are concerned). East used his certain winner on the same trick as South's loser, the @H2 - 2 of the defenders' trick-winners have just collapsed into 1.|
pg| ***** 203 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We will be able to win whatever East returns (ruffing if East plays his spade), draw the outstanding trumps, and win the rest of the tricks.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We will have lost 3 tricks and will lose no more. 10 tricks is our reward for ruffing dummy's @H2 with the high @D7 in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 205 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up||at|
Let's go back and see what happens if East refuses to overruff with his natural trump trick.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East could underruff if he wanted to (with the @D4, @D5, or @D6), but we have learned that underruffing is usually just a waste of a perfectly good trump.|
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|c|at|
Suppose, therefore, that East discards and allows dummy's @D7 to win the trick. Once again South's @H2 has escaped its apparent fate of being a loser.|
pg| ***** 208 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|at|
Now that there are no more losers to ruff in the dummy, it is a good time to draw trump. East is welcome to take his @DA whenever he wants.|
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|d|pc|d|pc|d|at|

pg| ***** 210 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|dk|pc|h|pc|c|pc|da|at|
We continue the trump assault, leading South's @DK to drive out East's @DA.|
pg| ***** 211 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
That is the third and last trick for the defenders. We will win whatever East returns, draw the rest of East's trump, and emerge with 10 tricks.|
pg| ***** 212 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|up|32|at|
Here we have an example of a deal for ^*Inot^*N drawing trump right away. We needed to keep a trump in the dummy (specifically the @D7) so that South's losing @H2 could be ruffed. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East was always going to get his @DA and it did not matter if he chose to overruff with that card or not. South's losing @H2 is handled regardless and North-South's 10-trick total is 1 better than their 9-trick total when trumps were drawn at once.|
pg| ***** 214 ***** |

You should know that there was a danger on this deal in not drawing trump right away.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose the East-West hearts had been distributed as above. West has been given one of East's hearts, leaving East with just a singleton. |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Do you see what will happen now if declarer does not draw trump immediately (assuming the defenders do not draw trump first)?|
pg| ***** 234 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On the above layout of the defenders' hearts, East will be able to ruff in when declarer tries to cash his second heart winner. East will then lead the @DA and another diamond, voiding the dummy of trumps. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Not only will declarer be left with a losing @H2, but one of his certain heart winners will have lost a trick. North-South will end up with 8 tricks, 1 less than they would have won by simply drawing trump.|
pg| ***** 236 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Does this suggest that declarer should not try to ruff his @H2 in dummy (assuming the defenders do not lead trumps first)?

|
pg| ***** 237 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
No, it does not. Playing to ruff the @H2 loses a trick when hearts are divided 7-1 (or 8-0), but gains a trick on all other divisions of the defenders' hearts.|
pg| ***** 238 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This program has an appendix that lists the odds of various suit divisions. For now, this rule should be helpful:|
ht|h|cs|1|at|^^^-{When declarer and dummy are dealt 6 or fewer combined cards in a suit,
it is very unlikely that a defender was dealt a singleton or void in that suit.}|
pg| ***** 239 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal North-South have only 5 hearts between their hands. The 7-1 heart break that you see above is very unlikely to have been dealt. Declarer should try to turn his 9 tricks into 10 by ruffing his @H2 in the dummy. |
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If the hearts are divided as above this play will limit North-South to 8 tricks, but that would be very unlucky. The odds heavily favor a more even division of the defenders' hearts.|
pg| ***** 241 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Delaying the drawing of trumps is not without risk on this deal, but the risk is well worth taking. Going after that ruff in dummy will gain more often than it will lose.|
pg| ***** 242 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^^^-{Suits tend to divide in a relatively ^*Ieven^*N fashion. The 7-1 heart break is quite unlikely.

Here is another deal where it would be wrong to draw trump as quickly as possible. The trump suit is spades this time. Dummy has only 1 trump card, but South's 6 trumps are very strong. Only the @SQ is missing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|h|pc|h|pc|ha|at|
The first move should be to win trick 1 with the @HA. There are deals where it is correct to intentionally lose tricks that could be won, but this is not one of them. There is no reason to let West's @HK win the first trick.|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West's opening lead has exposed the @H2 as a loser in the South hand. It would be nice to ruff the @H2 in dummy, but dummy has far too many hearts for this play to work.

|
pg| ***** 248 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

pg| ***** 276 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

pg| ***** 281 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The fact the East's @SQ is guarded by 3 small cards means that 2 finesses would be required to play the trump suit without loss. On this deal it was impossible for us to finesse twice in spades so East's @SQ had to score.|
PG| ***** 282 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
8 ever told us our best play in the trump suit, but 1 finesse was not enough on this particular layout of the East-West spades. East's spade holding represented a natural trump trick on this deal.|
pg| ***** 283 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Also think about West's opening lead, the @HK. The lead of a King that is backed up by the Queen is very attractive when there is a trump suit. |
PG| ***** 284 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Look how well this lead worked here, even though South held the @HA. The lead of the @HK immediately established a trick that the defenders could win once they regained the lead.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
West's @HJ and @H10 (as well as the @HQ) made West's @HK lead even more attractive as an opening lead, but the @HQ turned out to be all that was required on this deal.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Well, we haven't said much about dummy's highest card, the @DK. The @DK should be a certain winner as the @DA is in the South hand. During our first attempt at playing this deal the @DK never won the certain trick it was suppose to.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
Can you see a way to remedy that situation?|

nt|^z@3^b@2
There is only 1 diamond in the South hand, the @DA. Once that card is played South will be void in diamonds. If we can later lead dummy's @DK and discard our losing @H2, we should be able to come to an extra trick.|

Let's have another look at all the cards, paying particular attention to the North-South diamonds this time.|
PG| ***** 307 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South has a singleton @DA and North has 5 diamonds including the @DK. There is good news and bad news with this card combination.|
pg| ***** 308 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The good news is that since South has just 1 diamond - he will be void after the @DA wins a trick. The @DK then can be used to win a trick and provide a discard for a loser (the @H2 in this case).

|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The bad news is that the diamond suit is blocked - it is impossible to win the @DA and @DK on successive tricks.|

All that remains is for the dummy to win the lead (the @CQ serves this purpose) so that the @DK can also be cashed.|

Declarer can enjoy all of the available winners without the need of a dummy entry in another suit, provided that he is careful to cash the @DA first (^*Ithe high card from the short hand^*N). This suit has its own built-in dummy entry - the @D6 can be led to get to the dummy ^*Iafter^*N the @DA is cashed.

at|If declarer makes the mistake of using his dummy entry ^*Ibefore^*N the @DA is played (say by leading the @D6 to dummy's @DQ on the first round), there could be trouble.

West now has the guarded @SQ so the trump finesse is booked to lose. The @DA is now in the dummy (along with

We were always planning on finessing in trump and all finesses (except proven finesses) will sometimes lose. It was important to discard our losing @H2 quickly, just in case the trump finesse lost. |

On this deal declarer should also delay drawing trump, but it would also be wrong for the defenders to draw trump. |
PG| ***** 356 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2

nt|^z@3^b@2
The bad news is that we have blocked the heart suit - there is no way to win tricks with the @HK and @HQ on successive tricks. A dummy entry in another suit will be required if the @HQ is to win a trick at all.|

Well, if you knew in advance that the defenders would duck the first round of hearts, there would be no point in playing that suit at once. You might as well draw trump, settling for 10 tricks and making sure the defenders do not get any ruffs.|

East's holding up the @HA was not an easy play to find. This first round duck would have been very wrong if South had been dealt a singleton @HK (instead of his actual doubleton).|

Consider West's choice of opening lead on this deal, the @SQ. We have already seen how leading a high card from a suit headed by the King-Queen is attractive when there is a trump suit. |
PG| ***** 443 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Leading from a suit headed by the Queen-Jack is also a good idea. The fact that West was dealt the @S10 and @S9 in addition to the @SQ and @SJ makes the lead from that suit even better.|
pg| ***** 444 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West's spades are solid except for the @SA and @SK. Once those cards are driven out West will have the master spades. Since North-South held both the @SA and @SK on this deal, it took 2 spade leads before the defenders had control of the spade suit. |
PG| ***** 445 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
If East had been dealt the @SA or @SK (or both cards), West's spade opening lead would have set up the suit for the defenders without them having to wait so long.|
pg| ***** 446 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
This deal can be thought of as a ^*Irace^*N between the declarer and the defenders. Declarer starts with 2 spade winners, the @SA and @SK. |
PG| ***** 447 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Once those cards are gone, the defenders will be able to win a spade trick. West gets his partnership off to a fast start in the spade race, knocking out one of South's high cards with his opening lead.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
The more high cards a partnership holds in the suit they are trying to set up, the better the chances that they will win the race. That is one of the main reasons why an opening lead from a suit headed by the King-Queen or Queen-Jack is so attractive. |
PG| ***** 461 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The opening lead gives the defenders a head start. Leading from a strong suit often allows the defenders to maximize this advantage.|

PG| ***** 582 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Declarer might have been able to win 2 separate tricks with those 2 trumps. Leading trumps means that the
declarer must use 2 of his trumps to win just 1 trick.|
pg| ***** 583 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West did get around to leading trump, but he waited too long. Remember that West won the first 2 heart tricks before leading a trump.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|pc|ha|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|at|
It is hard to fault West for leading from his @HAKQJ. That holding makes a great lead whether there is a trump suit or not.|
pg| ***** 585 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West should pause for thought, however, before playing to the second trick. This deal has all of the signs of a
crossruff.|
pg| ***** 586 ***** |


sk|w|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Remember, West can only see his own hand and the dummy. Here's what things look like from West's point of view.|
pg| ***** 587 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Dummy certainly has quite a few trumps and it is a good bet that declarer does too. As you will see when we study bidding, the declarer usually tends to have several cards in trump.|
PG| ***** 588 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
One of the 2 main signs that there might be a crossruff appears to be present - both declarer and dummy have several trumps.|
pg| ***** 589 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The other sign of an impending crossruff is also present. Dummy has the required short suit, in clubs, and the required diamond suit with several losing cards.|
PG| ***** 590 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Since West and North have 10 diamonds between their hands there are not many left for East and South. It is very likely that South is short in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 591 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Also, since West can see just 3 clubs between his hand and the dummy, it is a near certainty that South has several cards in clubs. West can only hope some of those cards are losers.|
PG| ***** 592 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
West, therefore, has a good idea that both declarer and dummy have a short side suit opposite a long suit with losers - the second key sign that there might be a crossruff.|
pg| ***** 593 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Once West realizes that the deal might contain a crossruff for declarer, he should follow the advice you just learned about defending against a crossruff:|

PG| ***** 596 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Remember that when West won ^*Iboth^*N of his heart tricks before leading a trump we were able to win 10 tricks. It's a different story if West plays a spade after winning just 1 heart trick. Watch...|

Now let's look at the deal from East's point of view. East would like to return a trump in an attempt to cut down the impending crossruff, but he is now void in spades. |
PG| ***** 600 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East started with just 1 trump and that card was played on the first round of spades. Perhaps West has a trump left and can be given the lead so that he can play it.|
pg| ***** 601 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East, in fact, has good reason to believe that his partner has an entry in hearts. West's opening lead was the @HA and we already know that a side suit Ace is a bad opening lead unless the King is held as well. |
PG| ***** 602 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East should lead a heart, hoping to get his partner on lead for another trump play.|
pg| ***** 603 ***** |

East's good heart lead is rewarded. West has the expected @HK, and the @HQ and @HJ are a nice bonus. West also has a trump left, just as East had hoped.|

The excellent play by both defenders leaves declarer in a bit of a spot. The defenders have led trumps twice leaving dummy with 3 trumps. |
PG| ***** 607 ***** |

South has 4 club losers. He will not be able to ruff all of them in the dummy.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
South is going to have a club loser left when the crossruff is done. |
PG| ***** 609 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The defenders will win another trick, their fourth, holding us to 9 tricks - 1 less than we won when the defense led trumps only once. This time the defenders (especially West) deserve some serious congratulations!|
pg| ***** 610 ***** |


sb|s|
nt|^z@3^b@2
It should be noted that we were triply unlucky on this deal. Not only did the defenders play some great bridge, but both clubs and diamonds were dealt 5 and 2 in the East-West hands (remember 1 round of clubs has been played already).|
pg| ***** 611 ***** |

The @CK in the dummy didn't turn out to be so useless after all. It's not that the @CK was ever going to win a trick in its own right, but that card did restrict the defenders' entries.|

Only one defender was able to win a trick in clubs - the defender who was dealt the @CA. Only one defender could ever have a club entry.|

Now West (the hand with the doubleton spade) has the @CA instead of East. On this layout, West has the club entry so it is fine for him to kill his own heart entries.|
PG| ***** 637 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
After cashing the 2 top hearts, West can then lead a trump. The @CA will be his entry to lead a second round of trump. With clubs and diamonds dividing badly, 9 tricks will be declarer's limit.|

md|0,ck,c7,ca|
nt|^z@3^b@2
If dummy's @CK is turned into a small card it does not matter who was dealt the @CA. The defenders now have a choice as to who should win the club trick.|
PG| ***** 639 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
With a low club in dummy, West can get away with cashing his second heart trick. West will switch to a trump and later use his partnership's club entry to lead his second trump.|
pg| ***** 640 ***** |

ht|p|at|At notrump it would be much harder to build a long card trick in this suit (although the defenders might build a trick for you by cashing 4 tricks themselves). When there is a trump suit, however, the possibility of ruffs in the dummy makes the task much less daunting.

For now, just be aware of the fact that a trump suit often makes it easier to set up small cards in long suits as trick-winners. Besides suit establishment, there were many interesting techniques that were introduced in the crossruff deal we just saw. However, the primary objective of this deal was to introduce a new reason not to draw trump immediately:

^-{ When to draw trump }
^-|fp||at|
We have come to the end of the new material in this chapter about the trump suit. Our study of the trump suit started and finished with crossruff deals. In between we saw a deal in which declarer should draw trump right away. We also saw several deals in which declarer should delay drawing trump for a variety of reasons. Before you do the exercises that follow, let's review the reasons that we have seen which might suggest to declarer that he delay drawing trump:

|
pg| ***** 658 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{1. Dummy's trumps might be required to ruff declarer's side suit losers.}

|

cs|2|at|{2. Declarer might need to discard a side suit loser on an extra winner first.}

pg| ***** 660 ***** |


cs|3|at|{3. Dummy's trump winners might be needed as entries for side suit finesses.}

|
pg| ***** 661 ***** |


cs|1|at|{4. In crossruff deals declarer tries to maximize his ruffs in both hands.
Drawing trump often makes this task difficult or impossible.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 662 ***** |


cs|4|at|You may have received the impression that there are not very many deals where declarer should draw trump immediately. That is not the case, despite the high percentage of deals in this chapter where drawing trump should be delayed. The following is a good general guideline that will help you make the big decision as declarer:

|

The next move is to draw all of the defenders' trumps and South's hearts are more than strong enough for this task. The South hand will win the rest of the tricks, with North-South winning 12 tricks in all.|

This deal is deceptive because ruffs in dummy usually take place when the dummy has 2 or fewer cards opposite declarer's losers. |
PG| ***** 706 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal dummy has 3 spades, but declarer can still ruff a spade loser in dummy and wind up with 12 tricks.|

The key lesson of this deal:
^^^-{When it looks obvious to draw trump immediately, think twice before proceeding.
Losers can sometimes be ruffed in dummy even if dummy has no obvious short suit.}
