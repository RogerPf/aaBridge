^-{ How the bidding works }
^-|fp||at|
There are 2 main things that happen on every bridge deal, the bidding, which always happens first, followed by the play of the cards. Up until now almost everything we have learned has been about the play of the cards. This should help make it easier for you to get a good grasp of what the bidding is all about.

|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


cs|4|at|We have already learned enough about bidding to know that it is a very important part of every bridge deal. The bidding determines:

^-{Which player will be the declarer}

|cs|1|at|{Which player will make the opening lead}

|cs|3|at|{What the declarer's trick-winning goal will be}

|cs|2|at|{What the trump suit will be (or if the deal will be played at notrump)}
^-
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|In this chapter we will have a look at the mechanics of the bidding and how all of the above factors are determined in the bidding. We will also have a look at some strategies that a partnership can use to help facilitate accurate bidding.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |

|st||sk||
md|sajt9h2da32ckjt98,s432hqt54djt9ca43,skq87ha987dq54cQ2|rh||at|The best way to get a feel for the bidding is to watch it happen in a real bridge deal. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On each deal of bridge one player is responsible for shuffling and dealing out the cards. This player is known as the
dealer. The dealer is indicated in the top left corner of the screen by the letter ^*bD^*n (it is South on this deal).|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The dealer rotates in a clockwise manner around the table. When the bidding and play of the cards of this deal are finished, West, the next player clockwise after South, will be the dealer for the next deal.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is a nice reward that the dealer receives for his job of shuffling and dealing. The dealer is the first player to participate in the bidding.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
On this deal South is the dealer so he is the first player who has a chance to make a bid.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ha||
at|^^ 
What exactly does making a bid consist of ?       Watch...|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|1c|an|The opening bid|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You can now see a bidding diagram on your screen with a single bid displayed. South, the dealer, has bid 1@C. 

The first bid is referred to as the opening bid.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
In a real bridge game the bidding is done verbally. South would actually say "one club" out loud, to let the other players at the table know what bid he chose to make.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The bidding, like the play to each trick and the rotation of the dealer, proceeds in a clockwise manner around the table.  Bridge is a very clockwise game.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
South has bid 1@C and now it is West (the next player sitting clockwise after South) who gets a chance to bid.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


mb|p|
nt|^z@3^b@2
This particular West decides not to bid at all at his turn. Instead West chooses to pass and it becomes North's turn to either bid or pass.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^^^-{Each player can either bid or pass at his turn during the bidding.
There is a bit more to it than that, but the above rule is a good one for now.}
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Passes only come in 1 flavor, but there are 35 possible bids a player can make. Each of the 35 possible bids consist of 2 parts:|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


cs|4|at|^^^-{1. A number between 1 and 7 (such as the 1 in South's 1@C bid).}^-
|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{2. Any one of the 4 suits (@S, @H, @D, or @C) ^*Ior^*N notrump (such as the @C in South's 1@C bid).}
|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|bt||n#|5|cs|2|at|So each bid consists of a number between 1 and 7 and either one of the 4 suits or notrump. In bridge literature, NT is frequently used as an abbreviation for notrump when bidding is discussed. The number part of a bid is known as its level and the suit (or notrump) part of a bid is known as its strain. Since there are 7 possible levels that a bid can have and 5 possible strains, there are 35 possible bids in total.

|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|^I     {1@C}|cs|1|at|     {1@D}     {1@H}     {1@S}     {1NT}        

^I     {2@C}     {2@D}     {2@H}     {2@S}     {2NT}        

^I     {3@C}     {3@D}     {3@H}     {3@S}     {3NT}

^I     {4@C}     {4@D}     {4@H}     {4@S}     {4NT}

^I     {5@C}     {5@D}     {5@H}     {5@S}     {5NT}
   
^I     {6@C}     {6@D}     {6@H}     {6@S}     {6NT}

^I     {7@C}     {7@D}     {7@H}     {7@S}     {7NT}

You can see 1@C, South's choice of opening bid in the deal we just saw, at the top left corner of this table. 1 is the level and clubs is the strain of a 1@C bid.|
ht|m|at| Here is a table containing all
 35 of the legal bids in bridge:|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ht|S|n#|3|cs|4|at|^-{At a player's turn to bid he can either pass or select one of the 35 bids listed above.
There are a couple of other possibilities in the bidding that will be considered later.}|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ht|b|cs|1|at|^-{Bidding is a ^*Iconversation^*N among the 4 players. The purpose of the conversation
is to decide the declarer, his goal, and which suit (if any) will be the trump suit.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|The ^*Ilanguage^*N that is used for the bidding conversation does not contain very many words. We have learned almost all of these words already:

|ht|h|cs|3|at|^B { 1 }    { 2 }    { 3 }    { 4 }    { 5 }    { 6 }    { 7 }

|cs|2|at|^B  { @C }   { @D }   { @H }   { @S }   {Notrump} 

|cs|4|at|^E  { Pass }|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ht|h|at|^MThere are only 2 other words that are permitted in
^Mthe language of bidding. We will learn about how
^Mthese 2 words are used much later in this program:

|cs|4|at|^P{Double}  ^U{Redouble}

|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{The bidding continues in a clockwise rotation until ^*I3 consecutive passes^*N are made.
The declarer, his goal, and trump suit (if any) are determined from the last bid made.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|So the bidding can go around the table several times, but it will eventually end when 3 consecutive players choose to pass. The last bid is then used to determine the declarer, goal, and trump suit (or notrump). Here's how:

|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{1. The trump suit (or notrump) is determined by the strain of the last bid.}

|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


cs|2|at|{2. Declarer's goal is determined by adding 6 to the level of the last bid.}

|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


cs|4|at|{3. The declarer is either the player that made the last bid or his partner (more on this soon).}

|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


st||
nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's review how the principles we have learned about bidding so far might apply to this deal. Remember that South was the dealer, giving him the right to make the first bid. South chose to open the bidding with 1@C. West's turn came next and he chose to pass. It is now North's turn to bid.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


mb|p|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose that North also chooses to pass, making it East's turn to bid. As you will learn, it would be a poor idea to pass South's 1@C opening bid with the actual North hand, but right now we are just learning the ^*Imechanics^*N of bidding - not the ^*Istrategy^*N. Don't worry if you know something about bidding already and disagree with any of the bids or passes in the first few examples.

|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|p|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose that East also passes. 3 consecutive players (West, North, and East) have now passed. That means that the bidding is over. 1@C is the last bid. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|
Here's how the trump suit and goal are determined by the last bid of 1@C:
^^^-{The trump suit is determined by the strain of the last bid - the trump suit is clubs.}
|cs|4|n#|9|at|{The goal is determined by adding 6 to the level of the last bid - the goal is 7 (6+1) tricks.}
|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The declarer is either the player that made the last bid (South) or his partner (North). Here is how this vital issue is resolved:|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^-{The first member of the partnership to make a bid with the strain of the contract
becomes declarer. South is the only player to have bid at all - he will be declarer.}
|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
So South will be the declarer. His goal is to win 7 tricks (with North's help, of course). The deal will be played with clubs as the trump suit.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^^^-{Bridge players use the word contract to describe the declarer, his goal, and the
trump suit (if any). On this deal we would say, "The contract is 1@C by South."}
|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The notion of the contract is so central to the game of bridge that it is actually part of the game's proper name. That's right, the game you are learning is really called contract bridge, but nowadays most people simply use ^*Ibridge^*N. The name contract bridge appears in the American Contract Bridge League, the organization that produced this program.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|^^ {Historical note:} |cs|1|at|    { ^FContract bridge was born in 1925 when Harold Vanderbilt defined the rules 
^Fand scoring system that are currently in use. Auction bridge, another form of 
^Fthe game, was very popular before Vanderbilt developed ^*Bcontract bridge^*C. 
^FNowadays contract bridge is played almost exclusively.}|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


pc|dj|
nt|^z@3^b@2
You can see that the contract, 1@C by South, is displayed in the lower right corner of the deal above. It is easy to see the trump suit and the declarer from this. Remember to add 6 to the level of the contract in order to know what the goal is (it is 7 tricks for North-South on this deal).|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|
You may think that it is a bit obscure to always add 6 to the level of the contract in order to know what the goal is. There is a good reason for this:
^^^-{The goal always represents a ^*Imajority^*N (7 or more) of the 13 total tricks. 1 is the
lowest level the contract can have. Add 6 to get 7 - the lowest majority of 13.}
|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


up||ub||ub||
nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's back up a little in the bidding to make sure you understand an important point that was made earlier. We have taken back the last 2 passes and, again, it is North's turn to bid.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


mb|2c|an|A raise|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose that North chooses to bid 2@C instead of passing. Again, this would be a poor choice of bids, but don't worry about that now. Since North's partner has already bid 1@C and since North's 2@C raises the level with clubs as trump, we use the word raise to describe this type of bid.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Why would North ever want to raise the level of the bidding? After all, we know that a 1@C contract requires only 7 tricks, but a 2@C contract requires 8 tricks - a more ambitious goal.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|ht|c|at|^^^-{If a partnership succeeds in taking enough tricks to satisfy the contract they will win
points. Some contracts at the higher levels reward success with lots of bonus points.}^-
|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^-{Partnerships will frequently attempt ambitious contracts in order to gain bonus points.
Players raise the bidding level so that they will have a chance to win these bonus points.}

|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ht|c|cs|4|at|^^^-{^*UWarning:^*N Trying for these bonus points is not free. If the declarer fails to win enough
tricks for his contract, it is the defenders' partnership that will score points on the deal.}
|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|^z@3^b@2
Suppose that the next 3 players pass. 2@C becomes the contract. You can see above that ^*ISouth^*N is still the declarer. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
You might have expected ^*INorth^*N, the player who made the last bid (2@C), to be the declarer. Make sure you understand why ^*ISouth^*N is the declarer:|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


cs|1|at|^^^^^-{South is the declarer as he was the ^*Ifirst^*N member of the partnership to bid the trump suit.}
|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The mechanics of bidding are quite simple and you have been introduced to most of these already. The hard part of bidding is learning when you should pass and what bid you should make, if instead, you choose to bid.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
For example, North's 2@C is not a very good choice of bids with his hand. We will learn why shortly.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|ub||ub||ub||ub||at|
We have backed up again to North's first turn to bid. What you are about to see is a recommended bidding sequence for this deal. Do not expect to understand ^*Iwhy^*N the bids and passes you are about to see are recommended. You will understand soon.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |

The response|mb|p|mb|1s|an|Opener's rebid|mb|p|mb|4s|an|Responder's rebid|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|^z@3^b@2
In the bidding sequence above, East and West have passed throughout, but North and South have both been busy - they have each made 2 bids. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The last bid was North's 4@S bid, but since South bid spades first (with his 1@S bid), South will be the declarer. The contract is 4@S by South. South will try to win 10 (4+6) tricks with the North-South cards.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
There is some useful terminology that will make it easier for us to discuss bidding. As we have seen, the first non-pass in the bidding is referred to as the opening bid.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The player that makes the opening bid is known as the opening bidder (or simply the opener) and his partner is known as the responder. Here South's 1@C makes him the opening bidder and his partner, North, becomes the responder.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
The responder's first bid (North's 1@H here) is referred to as the response.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
A player's second bid is called a rebid. Here we would say that opener's rebid is South's second bid of 1@S. Responder's rebid is North's second bid of 4@S.
|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{You will learn all about opening the bidding and how to respond when your partner
opens. You will also learn how the opener and responder should choose their rebids.}
|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is not hard to see that the bidding on this deal was like a ^*Iconversation^*N between North and South, even though you have not learned very much about what the words used in the conversation mean.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
East-West did not participate very much in this bidding conversation. They both passed every time it was their turn. Each pass carried this meaning: "I have nothing to add to the conversation at this time."|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Let's back up and explore North-South's bidding conversation, one bid at a time.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ub|9|
nt|^z@3^b@2
South was the dealer and chose to open the bidding with 1@C. If, instead, South had passed, then another player would have become the opening bidder.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


cs|4|at|^^^^^-{South's 1@C said: "Partner, my hand is strong enough to open the bidding
and I think clubs would make a good trump suit. Tell me what you think."}
^-
|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
^b@2It is easy to see why South wants clubs to be trump. Clubs are South's longest and strongest suit. We will soon learn what makes a hand strong enough to open the bidding.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |

pg| ***** 68 ***** |


cs|2|ht|c|at|^-{North's 1@H said: "Partner, I have a good enough hand to respond to your opening bid.
However, clubs don't thrill me. What do you think about the idea of hearts being trump?"}
^-|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
^b@2We can see why North prefers hearts to clubs - he has 4 hearts and only 2 clubs. We will soon learn what makes a hand strong enough to respond to an opening bid (as opposed to pass).|

^-|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
^B@2South doesn't like hearts because he was dealt a singleton in that suit. South's 4 strong spades, however, make that suit worth considering as a possible trump suit.|

^-|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
^B@2North has 4 nice spades making that suit attractive as trump. We will soon learn why a contract of 4@S earns bonus points and why North should think 10 tricks are possible.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
South has no reason to suggest another trump suit. His hand is not strong enough to try for an even more ambitious contract (like 5@S, 6@S, or 7@S) - we will learn why soon.|

Even though we haven't learned much about bidding yet, some parts of this conversation should already make sense to you. Notice, for example that much of the conversation was devoted to finding the best trump suit. North-South eventually settled on spades as trump (after South suggested clubs and North suggested hearts).

It should come as no surprise that North-South wanted spades to be trump. We learned earlier that ^*Ithe more the merrier^*N applies when selecting a trump suit. The fact that North-South have all of the high spades makes that suit even more attractive as trump.|

North-South have 8 spades between their 2 hands. Bridge players would describe this by saying that North-South have an 8-card fit in spades.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
It is obviously a sound idea for the declarer's partnership to have a ^*Imajority^*N of the 13 cards in the trump suit they choose. A 7-card trump fit represents a small majority of the 13 trumps, but experience dictates that most deals should be played in notrump if no 8-card fit (or better) is present.|

nt|^z@3^b@2
A 7-card trump fit works well on some deals, but in general a minimum fit of 8 cards is required before having a trump suit will be more beneficial than playing in notrump.|

n#|7|at|There are several interesting consequences to the ordering of the 35 bids. On this bidding, for example, if South wanted to suggest that clubs or diamonds should be trump, he would have to bid either 3@C or 3@D to do so - 1@C, 1@D, 2@C, and 2@D are not allowed now that North has bid 2@H.

By bidding 3@C or 3@D South not only changes the trump suit, he also increases the number of tricks in the goal. Always remember that the higher the level of the contract, the more tricks you will have to try to win as declarer!|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
So South can still bid spades or notrump at the
2-level, but he must go to the 3-level (or higher) to
bid clubs, diamonds, or hearts.

A heart bid by South, which would now have to
come at the 3-level (or higher), would be considered
a raise of the suit that North opened.

at|Does it appear that there is something unfair going on here?

If the strain of the contract is notrump then bidding to 3NT and winning 9 tricks is enough to receive the bonus points for game.

Spades and hearts must be bid to the 4-level (4@S or 4@H) where 10 tricks are required for the game bonus. It is even worse for diamonds and clubs. Now the game bonus kicks in at the 5-level (5@D or 5@C) where 11 tricks are required.

^-{It may not seem fair, but all 5 strains are not equal in bridge. Notrump is the most
privileged strain, followed by spades and hearts, then diamonds and clubs.}
^-

at|This inequality of the 5 strains is apparent in 2 ways:

|cs|3|at|^-{1. In terms of the rank of the 5 strains as far as the legality of bids go.}

|cs|2|at|{2. In terms of the levels of the easiest game contracts, 3NT, 4@S, 4@H, 5@D, and 5@C.}
^-

pg| ***** 132 ***** |


cs|1|at|Bridge players have 2 useful words that are used frequently to describe this inequality:

^-{Spades and hearts are the major suits, while diamonds and clubs are the minor suits.
Notrump is not a suit at all, but it is a strain even more privileged than the major suits.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


at|Make sure you remember which suits are the majors and which suits are the minors. This distinction is very important for proper bidding:

|cs|3|at|^-{Major suits: @S, @H}

|cs|2|at|{Minor suits: @D, @C}
^-
|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


at|As you will see, the inequality between the major and minor suits has a large impact on the strategies that the partnerships should employ in the bidding. In particular, players tend to go out of their way to tell their partners when they are long in one of the major suits.|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|n#|5|at|On most deals containing an 8-card (or longer) fit it is possible to win more tricks with that suit as trump than it would be at notrump. There are 2 good reasons for this:

^-{1. A trump suit can be used to stop the defenders from winning tricks in their long suits.}

|cs|2|at|{2. A trump suit can produce extra tricks by ruffing losers in the dummy.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


at|4 of a major suit  (4@S or 4@H) is usually a better game contract than 3NT when the partnership holds an 8-card (or longer) major suit fit. This is true despite the fact that 3NT requires only 9 tricks while 4 of a major requires 10 tricks. The presence of an 8-card trump fit will usually be worth at least 1 extra trick. You have seen the power of a trump suit in action!

|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


at|Experience has shown, however, that the presence of an 8-card (or longer) minor suit fit is not a good enough reason to select a game contract of 5@D or 5@C. 11 tricks are required for these 5-level game contracts - 2 more than the 9 tricks that 3NT demands. On most deals it is easier to win 9 tricks at notrump than 11 tricks with a trump suit.

|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


cs|1|at|The above can be summarized as:

^-{In terms of game contracts, 4@S or 4@H is usually best if an 8-card (or longer) fit exists.
With no 8-card major suit fit, 3NT is usually a better game contract than 5@D or 5@C.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


at|The search for an 8-card major suit fit is one of the main priorities that a partnership has in the bidding. If such a fit can be found (and the hands are strong enough), winning 10 tricks in a major suit game contract will usually be easier than winning 9 tricks in 3NT.|

You now know the basic mechanics and strategies of the bidding. Now it's time to consider 2 of the biggest questions about bidding in bridge:

|cs|1|at|^-{1. How does a player know when to pass and when to bid?}

|cs|3|at|{2. If a player chooses to bid, how does he know which bid to make?}
^-
|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


at|The rest of the chapter and the entire next chapter are devoted to answering these questions. To get started, recall that bidding is like a ^*Iconversation^*N among the 4 players. Here is what each of the 2 partnerships tries to learn from this conversation:

|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{1. Should the declarer be from our partnership or should we be defenders on this deal?}

|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


cs|4|at|{2. If the declarer is from our partnership, what should the level of the contract be?}

|
pg| ***** 184 ***** |


cs|1|at|{3. If the declarer is from our partnership, what should the strain of the contract be?}
^-
|
pg| ***** 185 ***** |


at|The first and second questions are harder to answer than the third one. That is due to the fact that the selection of the best strain does not involve any more than the partnership figuring out in which of the 4 suits they were dealt the most combined cards. Answering the first 2 questions involves figuring out the trick-winning strength of the partnership's hands. This is much harder to quantify than the number of combined cards that the partnership was dealt in various suits.|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Here again are the 3 main partnership objectives for the bidding:

|cs|2|at|^-{1. Should the declarer be from our partnership or should we be defenders on this deal?}

|cs|4|at|{2. If the declarer is from our partnership, what should the level of the contract be?}

|cs|1|at|{3. If the declarer is from our partnership, what should the strain of the contract be?}
^-
We have already made some good progress in how the partnership should go about answering the third question.

|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{First the partnership tries to figure out in which of the 4 suits they were dealt the ^*Imost^*N
^*Icombined cards^*N. They also try to figure out how many cards are in their longest fit.}

|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


cs|2|at|{If the longest fit is less than 8-cards, the deal usually belongs in notrump.}

|
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


cs|4|at|{If the longest fit is 8-cards or more, that suit should usually be the trump suit.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


cs|1|at|We have already seen one exception to the last of these guidelines:
^-
{5@D and 5@C are usually contracts to avoid even if an 8-card (or longer) minor suit fit exists.
3NT is often an easier contract in this case and offers the same game bonus as 5@D and 5@C.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


at|The above guidelines will do a pretty good job with respect to selecting the best strain for the contract. Now let's investigate what considerations apply to selecting the appropriate level.|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|To answer these questions effectively:
|cs|2|n#|8|at|^-{1. Should the declarer be from our partnership or should we be defenders on this deal?}

|cs|4|at|{2. If the declarer is from our partnership, what should the level of the contract be?}
^-
The partnership must judge how many tricks they are likely to win in their best strain.

|
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


at|It is easy to look at a bridge hand and say, "I have 5 spades." It is not so easy to look at a bridge hand and say, "I can win 9 tricks with spades as trump with the help of my partner."

|cs|1|at|^-{Judging the number of tricks the partnership can win is not an exact science.
The best we can do is to think about what features of a hand contribute to winning tricks.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


at|Fortunately, we have already learned quite a bit about how to win tricks. We know:

|cs|3|at|^-{An Ace will always win a trick (unless it is ruffed).}

|
pg| ***** 195 ***** |


cs|2|at|{A King will often win a trick (if the partnership also holds the Ace in that suit,
or by finessing against the Ace, or by promotion if the Queen is also present).}

|
pg| ***** 196 ***** |


cs|4|at|{Queens and Jacks win tricks less frequently, but still represent valuable assets.
Strong middle cards (10s and 9s) will also come into play in many card combinations.}

|
pg| ***** 197 ***** |


cs|1|at|{In general, the higher a card the more likely it is to win a trick.}

|
pg| ***** 198 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
It is no big surprise that high cards tend to win tricks. We have also seen:

|cs|1|at|^-{Having several high cards ^*Iconcentrated^*N in the same suit is a good thing, especially in long
suits. High cards in short suits (especially singletons) often have little trick-winning value.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 199 ***** |


at|High cards are not the only features of a bridge hand that contribute to winning tricks.

|cs|3|at|^-{Small cards in long suits often win tricks through suit establishment.
Having a long suit (or more than one) will often be worth several extra tricks.}

|
pg| ***** 200 ***** |


cs|2|at|{Short suits can also be a valuable asset, but only if a good trump fit is present. Short suits 
can win extra tricks with ruffs and they can stop the defenders from running their long suits.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 201 ***** |


at|So high cards win tricks, low cards in long suits win tricks, and short suits can win tricks (as long an adequate trump fit is present).

We know how to win tricks. What we need now is a way to ^*Imeasure^*N a bridge hand in terms of how many tricks it is likely to win. Ideally we would like to come up with a ^*Iformula^*N for evaluating a hand's trick-winning potential. Such a formula should take into account all of the factors that we have seen that contribute to winning tricks.

|
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{^*UGood news!!!^*N There is such a formula and it is very easy to learn!
The formula is called the 4-3-2-1 point count.}
|
pg| ***** 203 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|
 {Historical note:} |cs|1|at|^F{Charles Goren, arguably the most famous bridge player ever, standardized
^Fand popularized the 4-3-2-1 point count in the late 1940s. Goren's system
^Fmade it much easier for average bridge players to learn bidding and to bid
^Faccurately. Contract bridge quickly became the most popular card game in the
^Fworld, largely as a result of Goren's contribution.} 

|
pg| ***** 204 ***** |


at|The 4-3-2-1 point count is a ^*Iformula^*N for estimating a hand's trick-winning potential. Every 13-card bridge hand is assigned a specific number of points using this formula. The more points a hand contains the more tricks that hand is likely to win. Here's how it works:

|
pg| ***** 205 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{Count ^*I4 points^*N for every ^*IAce^*N in your hand.}

|
pg| ***** 206 ***** |


cs|2|at|{Count ^*I3 points^*N for every ^*IKing^*N in your hand.}

|
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


cs|4|at|{Count ^*I2 points^*N for every ^*IQueen^*N in your hand.}

|
pg| ***** 208 ***** |


cs|1|at|{Count ^*I1 point^*N for every ^*IJack^*N in your hand.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


at|The total you come up with is known as the high card point (or HCP) value of your hand.

|
pg| ***** 210 ***** |


at|It is easy to see why Goren called his formula the 4-3-2-1 point count and why this formula is so easy to remember and to use. Take a moment and make sure you remember:

|cs|3|at|^-{Aces are worth 4 HCP, Kings 3, Queens 2, and Jacks 1.}
|
pg| ***** 211 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Try counting the high card points for this hand using the 4-3-2-1 scale:

|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psak5432hkq2d2ckqj|at|}

|
pg| ***** 212 ***** |


cs|2|at|{The hand contains 1 Ace, the @SA. Each Ace is worth 4 HCP.
The hand contains 4 HCP in Aces.}

|
pg| ***** 213 ***** |


cs|4|at|{The hand contains 3 Kings, the @SK, @HK, and @CK. Each King is worth 3 HCP.
The hand contains 9 HCP in Kings.}

|
pg| ***** 214 ***** |


cs|1|at|{The hand contains 2 Queens, the @HQ and the @CQ. Each Queen is worth 2 HCP.
The hand contains 4 HCP in Queens.}

|
pg| ***** 215 ***** |


cs|3|at|{The hand contains 1 Jack, the @CJ. Each Jack is worth 1 HCP.
The hand contains 1 HCP in Jacks.}


|
pg| ***** 216 ***** |


cs|2|at|{There are 4 HCP in Aces, 9 HCP in Kings, 4 HCP in Queens, and 1 HCP in Jacks.
The grand total is 18. The above hand contains 18 high card points.}
|
pg| ***** 217 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
See, it was not very difficult to figure out that this hand contains 18 HCP:

|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psak5432hkq2d2ckqj|at|}
^-
In fact, this was a relatively difficult hand for the purposes of counting points (because this hand contains several cards that count towards the total).

|
pg| ***** 218 ***** |


at|With most hands, counting high card points is much easier. For example:

^-{|ih|psqj6h6543da543c32|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


at|This hand contains only 3 cards that count for any high card points, the @DA (4 HCP), the @SQ (2 HCP), and the @SJ (1 HCP). There are 7 HCP in total in this hand.

|
pg| ***** 220 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|3|n#|5|at|Here again are the 2 hands that we just saw:

^D{|ih|psak5432hkq2d2ckqj|at|} |n#|t|at|^P{|ih|psqj6h6543da543c32|at|} 
|n^|9|cs|2|at|^d{18 high card points} ^p {7 high card points}


It is a good sign that the first hand (with 18 HCP) obviously rates to win several more tricks than the second hand (with only 7 HCP). It appears that Charles Goren was on to something very useful with the 4-3-2-1 point count!

|
pg| ***** 221 ***** |


at|OK, so we know how to count our high card points and that the more points a hand has the more tricks it is likely to win. How does this help us in deciding what we should bid and how does it help the partnership figure out what the best contract rates to be?

Goren's contribution to bidding theory went far beyond the standardization of the 4-3-2-1 point count. Goren also figured out the number of high card points between the partnership's hands that rate to be enough for various contracts to succeed.

pg| ***** 222 ***** |


ht|S|cs|4|at|^-{The 4-3-2-1 point count is more than just a way to measure a hand's trick-winning

nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Here is an example of how the 4-3-2-1 point count can help the partnership judge an appropriate level for the contract:

pg| ***** 224 ***** |


at|Let's look at the 2 hands we just saw and imagine that North was dealt the 7 HCP hand and that his partner, South, was dealt the 18 HCP hand:

|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psqj6h6543da543c32|at|}
^^
{|ih|psak5432hkq2d2ckqj|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 225 ***** |


at|There are 25 HCP between the 2 hands - enough to suggest that either 3NT, 4@S, or 4@H rates to be a good contract. Since the partnership has a 9-card fit in spades, spades should be selected as the strain of the contract. 4@S rates to be the best contract with these cards.|
pg| ***** 226 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|It turns out that the 4-3-2-1 point count is very accurate in suggesting the 4@S should be the best contract with these 2 hands:
|ht|c|n#|3|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psqj6h6543da543c32|at|}
^^
{|ih|psak5432hkq2d2ckqj|at|}
^-
To see this, count South's losers. North's @SQ and @SJ fill in South's spade suit such that there will be no losers in the trump suit. The @HA and @CA will surely win tricks for the defenders and they may come to a second heart trick as well. Still, that is only 3 losers at the most. North-South should be able to win at least the 10 tricks that 4@S demands. 

|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


at|Now imagine that North is able to give South this message in the bidding: "Partner, I have 7 HCP and 3 cards in spades. Please use this information to pick a contract!"

|
pg| ***** 228 ***** |


at|South would know to pick a contract of 4@S - he would know that the 2 hands contained enough HCP (25 or more) and enough spades (8 or more) to make 4@S into a good bet.|
pg| ***** 229 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Before we talk about how North-South can describe their hands to one another in the bidding (so that one of them is able to pick the best contract) there is an ^*Iextremely important^*N lesson about the 4-3-2-1 point count that you must learn.

pg| ***** 233 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|While high card points are a reasonable measure of a hand's trick-winning potential, they do not tell the whole story. Consider the first hand that we looked at for point-counting purposes:
|ht|d|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psak5432hkq2d2ckqj|at|}
^-
This hand has 18 HCP, but high cards are not the only reason that this hand is so strong. 

|
pg| ***** 234 ***** |


at|The 6-card spade suit is a major asset. If spades are trump this hand will likely win several tricks with small cards in spades. Even at notrump or with another suit as trump, there is a good chance that several small spades will win tricks via suit establishment. The 4-3-2-1 point count does not factor in the trick-winning power of a long suit.

|
pg| ***** 235 ***** |


at|There is a good solution to this problem that leads to more accurate hand evaluation:
|n#|8|cs|2|at|^-{Add 1 point if a hand contains a 5-card suit and 1 point for each additional card

^-
|ht|R|n#|8|at|The hand above contains 2 long suit points courtesy of the 6-card spade suit. By adding the high card points (18) and the long suit points (2), we arrive at the total points (20). Total points are a much more accurate reflection of a hand's value than high card points alone.
|

ht|U|n#|6|cs|4|at|^-{Total points = High card points + Long suit points}

^-
|
pg| ***** 238 ***** |


at|There are 9 high card points (4 for the @HA, 3 for the @DK, and 2 for the @DQ). Both hearts and diamonds contribute long suit points to this hand. The 5-card heart suit is worth 1 long suit point and the 6-card diamond suit is worth 2 long suit points. That makes 3 long suit points between hearts and diamonds. 9 high card points plus 3 long suit points equals 12 total points.

|
pg| ***** 239 ***** |


at|We have seen several deals in which short suits are an asset as well. In particular, if the deal contains a trump suit, a short side suit in the dummy will often produce extra tricks by allowing declarer to ruff his losers. There are times when points should be added for short suits, but we will cover those situations in the next chapter.

|
pg| ***** 240 ***** |


cs|4|at| {Historical note:} |cs|1|at|^F{Goren orginally counted points for short suits (instead of long suits) to
^Fcalculate the total points of a hand. Goren counted 1 short suit point for
^Feach doubleton, 2 for each singleton, and 3 for each void. Over the years it
^Fbecame apparent that long suit points were more accurate, as they provided

at|We also know which contracts award bonus points to a successful declarer and we have some good guidelines for selecting the best strain for the contract. In an prior example we saw:

We now have good set of rules for choosing the level and strain of the contract. If a player is able to tell his partner how many total points his hand contains and how many cards he was dealt in various suits, the partner can use this information to select a good contract. That's exactly what the bidding is all about. This task is easier said than done. Here is the main reason:|
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


cs|1|at|

^-{You cannot simply say to your partner, "I have 6 spades and 20 total points." The very
limited language of the bidding must be used to tell your partner about your hand.}
^-
|cs|2|at|It is possible for a partnership to communicate effectively in the bidding, even with the small number of words that the language of bidding contains. In order for the 2 partners to understand each other they must ^*Iagree on the meanings^*N of various bids. For example, the partnership may choose to make some rules like this:

|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


at|^-{A 1@S opening bid promises 5 or more cards in spades and between 13 and 21 total points.}
^-
|at|Imagine that you and your partner agreed to make this rule. Every time that you opened the bidding with 1@S your partner would know immediately quite a bit about your hand. Your subsequent bids could be used to tell your partner more about your hand (like narrowing the 13-21 total point range or describing your lengths in other suits).

At some point your partner will hopefully have enough information about your hand to select the best contract for the partnership.|

There is a ^*Istandard^*N set of rules that describe the ^*Imeanings^*N of various bids.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


at|It will come as no surprise that it was Charles Goren who developed the initial set of bidding rules for the 4-3-2-1 point count. Goren used the name Standard American for his bidding system (a bidding system is a set of several rules like the one above).

Standard American was so easy to learn and so effective that it quickly lived up to its name, becoming the ^*Istandard^*N bidding system in America as well as several other parts of the world. Standard American made it possible for 2 strangers to sit down at a bridge table as partners and understand each other's bids.

Over the years various bridge theorists have experimented with changing the definitions of some of the bids in Standard American. Some of these changes worked so well that they gradually caught on. Today's Standard American is different in some ways from the bidding system that Goren originally defined.|
pg| ***** 251 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Most of the remainder of this program will be devoted to teaching you a bidding system that is best thought of as a modernized version of Goren's teachings. Once you learn this bidding system you will be able to play bridge with just about anyone as your partner. The bidding system you will learn doesn't really have an official name, but we will call it:

|cs|1|at|^-{Modern Standard American with 5-Card Majors}
^-
|
pg| ***** 252 ***** |


at|You have just learned where the "Modern Standard American" part of this name comes from. The "5-Card Majors" part comes from one of the most important rules in this bidding system:

|cs|4|at|^-{A 1@H or 1@S opening bid promises ^*Iat least 5 cards^*N in the suit named.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 253 ***** |


at|This is one of the biggest differences between our bidding system and Goren's original Standard American. Goren's system allowed for major suit opening bids to be made on 4-card (or longer) suits. The modern theory is that 5-card majors is both easier to learn and more effective than Goren's system of 4-card majors.

|
pg| ***** 254 ***** |


at|Here is another rule that will be part of our bidding system:

|cs|2|at|^-{A 1@C, 1@D, 1@H, or 1@S opening bid promises ^*Iat least 13^*N total points.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 255 ***** |


at|The average bridge hand contains 10 HCP - 1 Ace, 1 King, 1 Queen, and 1 Jack (there are 4 of each of these cards and 4 players so each player on average will be dealt 1 of each of these cards). It makes good sense that an opening bid should describe an above-average hand. With an average hand, it makes sense to pass as you don't really have anything to say.|
pg| ***** 256 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Here again are the 2 bidding ^*Irules^*N that we have learned so far:

|cs|4|at|^-{A 1@H or 1@S opening bid promises ^*Iat least 5 cards^*N in the suit named.}

|cs|2|at|{A 1@C, 1@D, 1@H, or 1@S opening bid promises ^*Iat least 13^*N total points.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 257 ***** |


at|You are going to learn several rules like these in the lessons that follow. First there is something ^*Ivery important^*N that you should know about the nature of such rules:

|cs|1|at|^-{The above "rules" are not rules in the same sense as, "You must follow suit if you can."
A player is always free to make ^*Iany legal bid^*N, regardless of his partnership's bidding ^*Irules^*N.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 258 ***** |


at|That means you are allowed to open the bidding with less than 13 total points, you can pass with 13 or more total points, and you are welcome to open the bidding 1@H or 1@S with fewer than 5 cards if you feel like it. You will be breaking your partnership's rules, but you will not be breaking the rules of the game of bridge.

This does not suggest that it is a good idea to depart from the bidding system you and your partner use. In fact, it is generally a very bad idea - your partner will be misled as to the nature of your hand and he may choose a poor contract as a result.

|
pg| ***** 259 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{It is almost always correct to bid according to the partnership's rules. You are always
allowed to use your judgement, however, and make a non-system bid if you think it is wise.}

^-{  Opening the bidding with 1NT  }
^-|fp||at|
We now have a complete set of rules for deciding which suit to open at the 1-level. The next question we will explore is when a player should open the bidding with 1NT.

We have studied the play of the cards on many deals, both at notrump and when there is a trump suit. Recall that notrump tended to work well when the declarer's hand contained:

|
pg| ***** 270 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{1. Lots of high cards - both for winning tricks and for stopping the defenders' long suits.}

|
pg| ***** 271 ***** |


cs|2|at|{2. No voids or singletons - very short suits must be stopped with ruffs (thus a trump suit).}
^-
|
pg| ***** 272 ***** |


cs|3|at|Our definition of a 1NT opening bid reflects both these conditions:

^-{A 1NT opening bid promises between 15 and 17 HCP (not total points) in a balanced
hand. A balanced hand contains no voids or singletons and at most 1 doubleton.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 273 ***** |


at|There are 10 (4+3+2+1) HCP in each of the 4 suits, therefore 40 HCP in the deck. These 40 HCP rate to be divided evenly among the 4 players, making 10 HCP an average hand.

The 15-17 HCP range for a 1NT opening bid represents a hand that is worth more than an Ace (4 points) above average. That is enough to satisfy the first indication that a notrump contract might be best - lots of high cards. Since a balanced hand is required for a 1NT opening bid, the second indication that notrump might be best is also satisfied by our definition.

|
pg| ***** 274 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|So a 1NT opening bid promises 15-17 HCP and a balanced hand. There is one more thing you should know about 1NT openings before we look at some example hands:

|cs|1|at|^-{Our rule about when to open the bidding with 1NT takes priority over all of our other rules.}

ht|f|n#|5|cs|3|at|For example, with:|
ht|f|n^|5|at|^k{|ih|psKt5HA8DK954CAJ63|at|}

^^Do not open 1@D because you have 4-4 in the minors. This hand is a perfect 1NT opening bid. There are 15 HCP in this hand, just enough for 1NT, and the hand is certainly balanced, having just 1 doubleton. It is nice that there are stoppers in all 4 suits, but this is not a requirement for a 1NT opening bid. Do not open 1NT with the 2 hands below, use the other rules instead:

^B2 doubletons make this hand unbalanced.}
|ht|S|n#|2|at|^N {Open 1@D, not 1NT, despite the hand being
^N balanced. 18 HCP is too much for 1NT.}

qx|lim,wide Limiting your hand|
nt|^z@3^b@2|fp|t|cs|1|at|
^-{  Limiting your hand  }
^-|fp||at|
Notice how our definition of a 1NT opening bid has a relatively ^*Inarrow^*N HCP range:

|cs|1|at|^-{A 1NT opening bid promises between 15 and 17 HCP and a balanced hand.}
^-
|at|The difference between a minimum 1NT opening bid (15 HCP) and a maximum 1NT opening bid (17 HCP) is only 2 HCP. The fact that 1NT limits the opener's hand to such a narrow range is a very powerful concept. The partner of a 1NT opener will know immediately whether the best contract is likely to be a partial, game, small slam, or grand slam.

|
pg| ***** 278 ***** |


at|For example, imagine that your partner 
opens the bidding with 1NT. Your hand is:|
ht|m|cs|3|at|^N{|ih|psAQ87hk964dj32ct8|at|}

|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


ht|q|at|You have 10 HCP and you know your
partner has at least 15 HCP.
 
There must be at least 25 HCP between the 2 hands - enough for either 3NT, 4@S, or 4@H to be a reasonable contract. You know the partnership belongs in a game contract and you can use the rest of the bidding to discover in which strain game rates to be best (you will learn how soon).

|
pg| ***** 280 ***** |


at|Furthermore, since partner's 1NT has an upper limit of 17 HCP you also know immediately that a slam contract is impossible. The partnership has at most 27 points between the 2 hands - not even close to the 33 combined points that are usually required for a small slam.|
pg| ***** 281 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|
^-{One of the main goals in bidding is to limit the strength of your hand as ^*Inarrowly as possible^*N.
Your partner will then be able to judge whether a partial, game, or slam contract is best.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 282 ***** |


at|The 1NT opening bid does a great job of immediately limiting opener's hand, placing the responder in an excellent position to judge the best level of the contract. The point range we have been using for 1@C, 1@D, 1@H, and 1@S opening bids is not as narrowly defined. In fact, we do not even have an upper limit on the strength of these bids:

|cs|1|at|^-{Opening bids of 1@C, 1@D, 1@H, and 1@S promise 13 or more total points.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 283 ***** |


at|Imagine that you are dealt the same hand and your partner opens 1@D intead of 1NT:

|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psAQ87hk964dj32ct8|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


ht|Q|at|If your partner has a minimum hand with 13 total points, your 10 points mean that a partial rates to be best - 23 combined total points are less than the 25 total points that a game contract requires. If partner is a little stronger, however, a game contract should be reached. If partner is very strong, a small slam or even grand slam could be best.

|
pg| ***** 285 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{As 1@D is not narrowly limited, the best level of the contract is unknown.}
|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|It is, therefore, a good idea to place an upper limit on the strength of opening bids of 1 of a suit. It would be nice if we could make the maximum for such bids to be around 15 total points. That would narrow the range of 1-level suit openings to 13-15 total points - the same 2 point difference between a minimum and maximum 1NT opening bid.

It turns out that placing such a narrow range on opening bids of 1 of a suit causes more problems than it solves. Our effective range for these bids will be quite wide, but at least they will now have an upper limit:

|
pg| ***** 287 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{Opening bids of 1@C, 1@D, 1@H, and 1@S promise between 13 and 21 total points.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 288 ***** |


at|So now when you hold this hand and partner opens the bidding with 1@D:

|cs|3|at|^-{|ih|psAQ87hk964dj32ct8|at|}
^-
You won't know for sure what the level of the contract should be, but you will know that it must be either a partial or a game contract. Even if partner has a maximum hand with 21 total points, the 33 total points required for a small slam will not be present. As you will learn, in most cases opener can use his rebid to place a much more narrow limit on the number of total points in his hand.|

You are probably wondering what you are supposed to do as the opening bidder if you are fortunate enough to be dealt 22 or more total points. You can't open these hands with 1 of a suit because of our new and improved rule for these bids:

|cs|1|at|^-{Opening bids of 1@C, 1@D, 1@H, and 1@S promise between 13 and 21 total points.}
^-
If you opened a 22 point (or stronger) hand at the 1-level your partner would be misled into thinking that you had a weaker hand (21 points at the most). As such your partner could easily place the contract at too low a level. We will use 2 different opening bids to describe very strong hands:

|
pg| ***** 332 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{1. A 3NT opening bid promises between 25 and 27 HCP and a balanced hand.}

|cs|2|at|{2. A 2@C opening bid is used for all other hands with 22 or more total points.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 333 ***** |


at|The first of these rules is intuitively very sensible. We have already learned that 25 total points are usually sufficient to make 3NT (or 4@S or 4@H) a reasonable contract. By opening the bidding with 3NT you are giving this message: "Partner, I have enough points in my own hand to make 3NT a reasonable contract even if your hand contains no points at all!"

The balanced hand requirement for a 3NT opening also makes sense - we have already seen how such hands are suitable for notrump play.|
pg| ***** 334 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|
Our second rule for opening the bidding with very strong hands is not very intuitive at all:

^-{A 2@C opening bid is used for all hands with 22 or more total points that
are unsuitable for a 3NT opening bid (a balanced hand with 25-27 HCP).}
^-
|
pg| ***** 335 ***** |


cs|3|at|Suppose, for example, that you are dealt this beautiful hand:

^-{|ih|psakhakqjt83da97c6|at|}
^-
This hand contains 24 total points (21 HCP and 3 long suit points for the 7-card heart suit). According to the above rule, the correct opening bid with this hand is 2@C.

|
pg| ***** 336 ***** |


at|How can that be right? What if your partner passes your 2@C opening bid? This hand will almost certainly win 10 tricks with hearts as trump (enough for a game contract of 4@H) without any help from partner. The play is not likely to be very pleasant, however, if clubs are trump (not to mention that 2@C is a partial contract that awards no bonus points to a successful declarer).

|
pg| ***** 337 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{The 2@C opening bid is an example of an artificial forcing bid. The artificial part means
that the 2@C bid says nothing about clubs. The forcing part means that partner cannot pass.}
|
pg| ***** 338 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
We just got our first look at 2 new bridge words, artificial and forcing. These words were used to describe the 2@C opening bid - the bid we will be making on all hands with 22 or more total points that are unsuitable for a 3NT opening bid.

An artificial bid is a bid that says nothing about the strain named and does not suggest a final contract. The opposite of an artificial bid is a natural bid. A natural bid suggests a final contract and says something about the strain that was named.

You may have heard the word convention used to describe these artificial bids. For example, "the 2@C opening bid is my partnership's convention for showing a very strong hand," or "the 2@C opening is a conventional bid."

|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{A convention is like a ^*Icoded^*N bid that the partnership uses to exchange information.
Thousands of conventions have been devised, but only a few have become widely accepted.}

|
pg| ***** 340 ***** |


cs|1|at|{It is a very important rule of bridge that the ^*Icodes^*N used by conventions are ^*Inot secret^*N.
If your partnership adopts a particular convention, you must inform the opposing partnership.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 341 ***** |


at|Imagine that you are sitting South and open the bidding with 2@C. It is West's turn to bid. He has the right to ask, "What does that bid mean?" The rules of bridge obligate you to tell him, "2@C is an artificial forcing bid showing 22 or more total points."

The same rule applies to natural bids. Suppose you opened 1@H as South. West could ask, "Do you use 5-card majors?" You would have to truthfully answer his question.

|
pg| ***** 342 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|2|at|
^-{Bridge is a very honest game. Any agreements that a partnership makes about
the meanings of various bids must be ^*Idisclosed^*N to the opposing partnership.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 343 ***** |


at|You may be wondering why we are going to open almost all of our very strong hands with 2@C. It wasn't always this way. In Goren's original Standard American, 2@C, 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S opening bids were all used to describe very strong hands. Goren's 2-level suit openings were natural bids - the opening bidder with a very strong hand would bid his longest and strongest suit at the 2-level. This approach became known as strong 2-bids.

Over the years it became apparent that it was quite rare to be dealt a hand strong enough to qualify for a strong 2-bid. The idea of opening 2@C on all such hands was born, freeing up the 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S openings to describe other types of hands (more on this soon). 2@C became an artificial bid - it said nothing about clubs, only that the opening bidder held a very strong hand.

The concept of using 2@C as the only strong 2-level opening bid worked so well in practice that nowadays it is more or less the ^*Istandard^*N among top bridge players in North America. There are still some partnerships that use Goren's strong 2-bids, but their numbers get smaller each year.

|
pg| ***** 344 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{Standard American evolved as new conventions and approaches were developed.
A few of these have withstood the test of time and have become part of the ^*Imodern standard^*N.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 345 ***** |


at|Goren got a lot of things right, but there were some areas of his bidding system that left room for improvement. The decline of strong 2-bids and 4-card majors represent the 2 biggest changes from Goren's Standard American to the accepted ^*Istandard^*N of today.|
pg| ***** 346 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Not only is our 2@C opening an artificial bid, it is also a forcing bid.

|cs|2|at|^-{When your partner makes a forcing bid you must never pass. 
No matter how weak your hand is you must find some bid to make.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 347 ***** |


at|It is easy to understand why our 2@C opening bid should be defined as forcing. Have another look at the example hand that was given for a 2@C opening bid:

|cs|3|ht|h|at|^g{|ih|psakhakqjt83da97c6|at|}|
pg| ***** 348 ***** |


ht|m|at|Suppose you are dealt the hand on the left and properly open the bidding with 2@C. Suppose further that your partner was dealt the terrible hand on the right with a 6-card club suit.
|ht|h|at|^Q{|ih|ps432h2d432c543287|at|}
|
pg| ***** 349 ***** |


ht|p|at|Your partner's first instinct might be to pass your 2@C opening bid - he certainly would want clubs to be trump and he does not have enough points to suggest a game or slam contract. Passing 2@C would be a serious error. 
A game contract of 4@H is almost certain to succeed with these 2 hands, even though the weak hand will not be able to win any tricks.

|
pg| ***** 350 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{Never pass when your partner opens 2@C! Your partner's hand is likely strong enough to win
enough tricks for a game contract without any help from you. That's why 2@C is a forcing bid.}
|
pg| ***** 351 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|4|at|
^-{It is not a rule of bridge that you must not pass when your partner makes a forcing bid.
Remember that you can always make ^*Iany^*N legal bid or pass whenever you feel like it.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 352 ***** |


at|The reason you should not pass when your partner opens 2@C (or any of the other forcing bids that we will learn about) has nothing to do with the rules of bridge. It is all about trusting your partner and having confidence in the bidding system that you are using.

Whenever your partner makes a forcing bid he is saying:

"Partner, I have not finished describing my hand yet. Even if your hand is very weak I think we may be able to win enough tricks for a game or slam contract. Please respect my judgement and keep the bidding open no matter how horrible your hand is!"

|
pg| ***** 353 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{Trusting and respecting your partner in the bidding is vital to success at bridge.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 354 ***** |


cs|2|at|Here are the 2 main ways you can show trust in and respect toward your partner:

^-{1. Never pass when your partner makes a bid that is forcing in the bidding system.}

|cs|3|at|{2. Make sure that the bids you make accord to the definitions that we have established.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 355 ***** |


at|The rules of bridge do not force you to bid within the guidelines. However, by doing so, you not only make your partner happy, you also increase your chances of finding the best possible contract.|
pg| ***** 356 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|n#|5|at|We have already seen:

^-{1. A 1NT opening bid promises between 15 and 17 HCP and a balanced hand.}

|cs|4|at|{2. A 3NT opening bid promises between 25 and 27 HCP and a balanced hand.}
^-
How about a 2NT opening bid?|
pg| ***** 357 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^^^-{A 2NT opening bid promises between 20 and 21 HCP and a balanced hand.}
^-
It makes sense that the 2NT opening bid also promises a balanced hand and that its HCP range is about halfway between 1NT and 3NT. Notice that the range of a 2NT opening is only 2 HCP in size while 1NT and 3NT openings both have 3 HCP ranges.|
pg| ***** 358 ***** |

pg| ***** 359 ***** |


at|^^^^The hand on the right contains the @DJ as well, bringing its HCP total up to 22. This hand is too strong for a

^-{  Preemptive opening bids  }
^-|fp||at|
It is time to have a look at opening bids of 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S as well as suit opening bids at the 3-level and higher. It was mentioned earlier that Goren used all opening bids of 2 of a suit to describe very strong hands (strong 2-bids) and that nowadays most bridge players use 2@C as the only strong 2-level suit opening. 

In modern Standard American 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S opening bids are known as weak 2-bids. Here are some example hands for these openings:
^^|
pg| ***** 361 ***** |


cs|3|at|^c{|ih|ps52h86dkqj943cJ63|at|} |n#|t|at|^k{|ih|pd52h86skqj943cJ63}|at| ^s|ih|ps52d86hkqj943cJ63|n^|t|at|

|cs|2|at|^B      {A Weak 2@D opening}^J      {A Weak 2@S opening}^R      {A Weak 2@H opening}

|
pg| ***** 362 ***** |


at|Notice that each of these hands contains only 7 HCP, less than the 10 HCP of an average bridge hand. Each hand also receives 2 long suit points for having a 6-card suit. The 9 total points of each of these hands is not close to enough for a 1-level opening bid (which would require 13 total points).

How can it be right to open the bidding at the 2-level on 
^l   a hand that is not even strong enough for a 1-level opening bid?|
pg| ***** 363 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Have another look at these 3 hands and consider their potential to win tricks:
|cs|3|n#|5|at|^c{|ih|ps52h86dkqj943cJ63|at|} |n#|t|at|^k{|ih|pd52h86skqj943cJ63|at|} ^s{|ih|ps52d86hkqj943cJ63|n^|t|at|}

Each of these hands is very likely to win 5 tricks without any help from partner if their respective long suits are made to be trump. If another suit is trump, however, each of these hands might not be able to win any tricks at all. These hands may be useful in notrump, especially if partner's hand contains the Ace of the long suit.

|
pg| ***** 364 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{A weak hand with a long suit will usually be able to win several tricks if the long suit is
trump. Such hands tend to win far fewer tricks if the contract is in any other strain.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 365 ***** |


at|There are 40 HCP in the deck so if you are dealt only 7 of these HCP there are a lot of high cards in the other 3 hands. If partner is dealt his fair share of the 33 outstanding HCP there is a good chance that the partnership will be able to win enough tricks to succeed in a 2-level contract with the long suit as trump.

If partner also has a weak hand it is likely that the partnership will fail to win the 8 tricks required by a 2-level opening bid. The weak 2-bid might still work, even if partner also has a weak hand and the contract fails. In this case, it is very likely that the opposing partnership win enough tricks in some other strain to succeed in a game or slam contract of their own.|
pg| ***** 366 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|When you open with a weak 2-bid on hands like these:
|cs|3|n#|5|at|^c{|ih|ps52h86dkqj943cJ63|at|} |n#|t|at|^k{|ih|pd52h86skqj943cJ63|at|} ^s{|ih|ps52d86hkqj943cJ63|n^|t|at|}

you know that your contract may not succeed if partner also has a weak hand. Your partnership will lose points in this case, but the points you lose will be less than the bonus points that the opposing partnership would win if they were to succeed in a game or slam contract.

|
pg| ***** 367 ***** |


cs|2|at|If you pass with these sorts of hands the opposing partnership can start to explore for their best contract at the 1-level. By opening with a weak 2, however, the opponents must start exploration at a higher level of bidding. The weak 2 opening preempts the entire 1-level and part of the 2-level. This will almost always make life harder for the other partnership.

|
pg| ***** 368 ***** |


at|^-{Weak 2-bids are part of a class of bids known as preempts or preemptive openings.
Preempts take up bidding space, making it hard for the opponents to find their best contract.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 369 ***** |


at|Besides 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S, all 3 and 4-level suit openings in our bidding system are also preemptive in nature. It is difficult to rationalize the requirements for such bids without knowing more about how the scoring works in bridge. Bridge scoring is described in the Appendix section of this program, but don't worry about that for now - just try to learn the following definitions for the preemptive openings in our bidding system.|

|
pg| ***** 374 ***** |


at|In each definition there are not enough total points for a 1-level opening bid. The higher the level of the preempt, the more cards that are required in the long suit. A weak 2-bid requires a 6-card suit, while 3 and 4-level opening preempts require 7-card and 8-card suits respectively.

|

|HT|I|AT|Open 2@C. This hand has 23 total points (21 HCP and 2 long suit points). That is too strong for a 13-21 total point 1@S opening bid. Open 2@C on all hands with 22 or more total points that are unsuitable for a 3NT opening bid.|

|HT|S|AT|Pass - do not open 4@D as your suit is not strong enough. A preemptive opening bid suggests 2 of the top 3 cards (the Ace, King, and Queen) in the suit named. This hand has only 1 of the top 3 diamonds - not good enough for a 4@D opening.|
