^-{ ^*bWhat you will learn in this chapter^*n }
^-|fp||at|
In the last chapter we learned all about opening the bidding and how to decide if your hand qualifies for an 
opening bid of 1 of a suit, 1NT, 2NT, 3NT, 2@C, or a preempt. If your hand does not qualify for any of these
opening bids you should pass and give another player (hopefully your partner) a chance to open.

This chapter is all about what happens ^*Iafter^*N the opening bid has been made. In particular, you will learn:
^^|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{1. How to respond to an opening bid made by your partner.}

|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


cs|2|at|{2. How the opening bidder decides upon his rebid.}

|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|^^In the next and final chapter you will see that in many bridge deals ^*Iboth^*N partnerships get involved in the bidding. 

For now, however, we are going to assume that once an opening bid is made the opposing partnership will pass throughout the bidding.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


qx|1su,Responding to a 1 of a suit opening|
nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|5|fp|t|at|
^-{ Responding to a 1 of a suit opening }
^-|fp||at|
Your partner has opened the bidding and the next hand passes. You are the responder and it is your turn to bid. When should you pass your partner's opening and if you choose to respond, how do you decide which bid to make?

There are no simple answers to these questions - it depends a great deal on which opening bid your partner has made as well as the strength of your hand and the number of cards you were dealt in various suits.

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|Regardless of which opening bid was made, the responder must always be aware of what the partnership is trying to accomplish:

|cs|1|at|^-{1. To discover which trump suit (if any) would be best for the partnership. In particular, 
the search for an 8-card major suit fit is one of the primary objectives in the bidding.}

|cs|2|at|{2. To discover the combined strength of the partnership's hands so that a decision can be 
made as to whether the contract should be a partial, game, small slam, or grand slam.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|Some opening bids reveal a great deal of information about both the strength and distribution (the number cards held in various suits) of the opener's hand. The more responder knows about opener's hand, the easier it will be for him to select the best strain and level for the contract. Notrump opening bids and preempts, for example, will often tell responder at once everything he needs to know to select the best contract for the partnership.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Responder's task is usually more difficult when the opening bid is 1 of a suit. Suppose that your partner opens 1@C and you are dealt the following hand:

|ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp?|at|}
|ht|d|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|pssaq987hk632d9cJ76|at|}

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|^^So far all you know is that your partner has between 13 and 21 total points, at least 3 clubs, probably no 5-card major (unless he also has 6 or more clubs), and a hand unsuitable for a 1NT or 2NT opening bid. That may seem like a lot of information, but you still have no idea what the best strain or level for the contract is.

|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|If your partner has 3 or more spades, your 5-card suit means an 8-card major suit fit will be present and spades should be trump. You also have 4 hearts and if partner has 4 hearts then you will have an 8-card fit in that major suit. If there is no 8-card fit in either major then either clubs or notrump might make the best strain. All you really know about strain at this point is that diamonds should not be trump.

|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|The best level for the contract is also a mystery. You have 11 total points (10 HCP plus 1 long suit point). If partner's opening has only 13 total points, the partnership will not have the combined 25 total points required to make game contracts of 4@S, 4@H, and 3NT attractive - the best contract could be a partial. If partner has a maximum hand with 21 total points, however, the partnership is close to having the 33 total points required for a small slam.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|The bottom line is that you need more information about both the strength and distribution of your partner's hand before you can accurately place the contract.

|ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp?|at|}
|ht|d|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|pssaq987hk632d9cJ76|at|}|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp1s|at|}



It will probably come as no surprise to you that the correct response to your partner's 1@C opening bid on this hand is 1@S. You have 5 cards in spades, a major suit, and if partner has 3 spades, the magic 8-card major suit fit will be present. By bidding 1@S you are sending 2 messages to your partner:

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{1. You think that spades could make the best trump suit.}

|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


cs|4|at|{2. You have a strong enough hand to keep the bidding going.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|The fact that spades could make the best trump suit when you hold this hand is obvious, but how strong a hand do you need to make a bid when your partner opens 1 of a suit? There is a widely accepted guideline that answers this question:

|cs|1|at|^-{When your partner opens the bidding with 1 of a suit, you should make some bid whenever
you are dealt 6 or more total points. Otherwise, you should pass your partner's opening bid.}
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|So when responder makes a bid like 1@S after a 1@C opening he is promising his partner that he holds 6 or more total points. Is their any worry that the opener might pass at his next opportunity and that a game contract could be missed?

|ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp1sp?|at|}
|ht|d|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|pssaq987hk632d9cJ76|at|}

|cs|2|at|^^^^^-{No, there is no need to worry. In almost all bidding sequences, when the responder
introduces a new suit he is making a forcing bid - the opener should never pass.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


cs|4|at|The reason that 1@S is considered a forcing bid here is that it has no upper limit as far as total points. This particular hand has 11 total points - not quite enough to insist upon a game contract opposite an opening bid. Responder could have a much ^*Istronger^*N hand, however, and still bid 1@S. In that case it would be a disaster if the opener passed - the partnership would certainly belong in at least a game contract.


^-{In the same way that responder should never pass a forcing 2@C opening bid, the opener
should always make some bid when the responder forces by introducing a new suit.}
^-
Once again, the rules of bridge allow the opener to pass here, but it is highly recommended that he never do so. Passing a forcing bid usually leads to both a poor contract and an unhappy partner!|
ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp1sp?|at|}|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|The example hand that we have been considering contains 2 new suits, hearts and spades, worthy of consideration as the trump suit:
|ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp1s|at|}
|ht|d|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|pssaq987hk632d9cJ76|at|}

^^Responder will often be faced with the decision of which new suit to bid first. Here are a few simple rules that responder can use to resolve this decision:
|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


n#|7|cs|2|at|^-{Responder must have ^*I4 or more cards^*N in a new suit in order to respond in that suit.
5-card majors only applies to the opening bid - responder can bid a 4-card major.}

|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


cs|4|at|{If responder has 2 new suits with 4 or more cards, but with unequal
length, he should respond in the suit that contains the greater length.}

|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


cs|1|at|{If responder has 2 new suits that each contain ^*Iexactly^*N 5
cards he should respond in the higher-ranking of these suits.}

|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


cs|3|at|{If responder has 2 (or 3) new suits that each contain ^*Iexactly^*N 4 cards
he should respond in the suit that keeps the bidding as low as possible.}

|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


cs|2|at|{At least 10 total points are required for a new suit response at the 2-level.}|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2
Here are some example hands to illustrate the principles of which new suit to respond. Try to think about what you would bid as responder in each case:

|ht|f|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp?|at|}
|ht|e|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|pssAQ98h742dj8632ct|at|}
|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ht|f|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1cp1d|at|}



Respond 1@D, not 1@S. The spades are stronger and spades is a major suit, but the diamond suit contains 5 cards while there are only 4 cards in spades. Length is more important than strength for both opening bids and responses.
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ht|q|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1dp?|at|}
|ht|p|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|pshAQ98s742cj8632dt|at|}
|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ht|q|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1dp1h|at|}



Respond 1@H, not 2@C. The club suit is longer, but you would have to go to the 2-level to bid clubs. A new suit response at the 2-level promises 10 or more total points. This hand has only 8 total points (7 HCP plus 1 long suit point for the 5-card club suit). The 5-card majors principle applies only to the opening bidder - it is fine for responder to bid a 4-card major.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|ht|c|at|^C {|ia| 1dp?|at|}
|ht|b|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|psK9642hakq83da2c7|at|}
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


cs|1|ht|c|at|^C {|ia| 1dp1s|at|}



Respond 1@S, not 1@H. The heart suit is considerably stronger than the spade suit, but you should always respond in the higher-ranking of 2 5-card suits (the same principle applies when the opening bidder has 2 5-card suits).

This is a very strong hand with 18 total points (16 HCP plus 2 long suit points for the 2 5-card suits). If opener has a strong hand there might even be enough combined total points for a grand slam. There is no need to worry about partner passing your 1@S response - a new suit bid by responder is forcing.

|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ht|s|cs|1|at|^C {|ia| 1dp?|at|}
|ht|r|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|psqj83hj964d6cAK74|at|}
|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


cs|1|ht|s|cs|1|at|^C {|ia| 1dp1h|at|}



Respond 1@H, not 1@S or 2@C. With exactly 4 cards in 2 or 3 new suits you should respond in the suit that keeps the bidding as low as possible.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|ht|c|at|^C {|ia| 1hp?|at|}
|ht|b|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|psQt832h7d832dcJ876|at|}
|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


cs|1|ht|c|at|^C {|ia| 1hpp|at|}



Pass, do not respond 1@S. That was a bit of a trick question. Remember that you need 6 total points in order to respond to an opening bid of 1 of a suit. The hand has only 4 total points (3 HCP and 1 long suit point for the 5-card spade suit) - not enough for a response.

|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|It is true that hearts might not make the best trump suit for your partnership. Your partner's 1@H opening promises at least 5 cards in hearts, but he also could have several spades. It is not at all unlikely that the partnership has more combined cards in spades (or clubs or diamonds) than it does in hearts.

The danger in bidding 1@S in an attempt to improve the trump suit is that your partner will expect you to hold a hand with at least 6 total points - he could easily place the contract at a high level and be very disappointed at the quality of your hand. It is best to keep the contract as low as possible when you are dealt this weak of a hand. Passing your partner's 1@H opening bid is the best way to keep the bidding low.

|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{Making a bid that promises more total points than you have is called overbidding.
The usual result of an overbid is to arrive in a contract that cannot possibly succeed.}
|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|You have learned pretty much all there is to know about responding in a new suit to your partner's opening bid. It is frequently the case, however, that you should respond either in notrump or by raising the suit that was opened to a higher level. Here is an example:

|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ht|f|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1hp?|at|}
|ht|e|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|psKJ65hq752d92cQ76|at|}
|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


cs|1|ht|f|at|^C{|ia| 1hp2h|at|}



Raise to 2@H, do not bid 1@S. Your partner's 1@H opening promises at least 5 hearts and he cannot have more spades than hearts (or he would have opened 1@S). You already know that your partnership has at least 9 hearts between the 2 hands - more than enough to make hearts an attractive trump suit. There is no reason to confuse the issue by suggesting another suit as trump. Let your partner know about your fine support for his suit immediately!

|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{The raise of a major suit opening to the 2-level (a single raise) promises between
6 and 9 total points and at least 3-card support for the opening bidder's suit.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|One of the main advantages of a 5-card majors bidding system is that you can comfortably raise your partner's major suit opening bid with 3-card support and be secure in the knowledge that an 8-card major suit fit exists. The above example contains 4-card support for opener's heart suit, but it would still be correct to raise to 2@H (and not bid 1@S) on a similar hand with only 3 hearts.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|cs|1|n#|5|at|The responder sends the opener 2 messages with a single raise of a major suit opening bid:

^B{|ia| 1Hp2H|at|} ^O{|ia| 1Sp2S|at|}

|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{1. I know that the major suit you opened should be the
trump suit as we must have at least an 8-card fit in that suit.}

|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


cs|2|at|{2. I have enough total points to keep the bidding going. A game contract is still possible,
but only if you have significant extra values beyond your minimum of 13 total points.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|The first of these messages is obviously useful to the opener - it tells him what the trump suit should be. Here's how the opener makes use of the second message: The 1@S opening bid promises between 13 and 21 total points. The 2@S single raise promises between 6 and 9 total points. 25 combined total points are required for a game contract of 4@S.

|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{If the opener has between 13 and 15 total points he will know that the partnership
has 24 combined total points at most - not enough for a game contract of 4@S.}

|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


cs|1|at|{If the opener has between 16 and 18 total points he will know that the partnership
^*Imight^*N have the requisite 25 combined total points for a game contract of 4@S.}

|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


cs|4|at|{If the opener has between 19 and 21 total points he will know that the partnership is
^*Icertain^*N to have at least 25 combined total points - enough for a game contract of 4@S.}

|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|We have had our first look at raising the opening bidder's suit. Before we go on and look at some other raising situations (such as a jump raise like 1@H-3@H), there is an important lesson to learn about how the responder should count his total points when considering a raise. Take this hand for example:

|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ht|e|n#|7|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1hp?|at|}
|ht|e|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|ps8hk765daj87ct842|at|}

|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|^^We have been counting 8 total points for this hand, all in HCP. There are no long suit points because there is no 5-card or longer suit. There is something of great value in this hand beyond its 8 HCP after partner opens 1@H. Can you see what it is?

|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|The hand contains a singleton spade. The opening bidder is likely to have small cards in spades. He will be able to ruff some of these losers in your hand when you are dummy in a contract with hearts as trump.
|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


cs|3|at|^^^^^P{|ih|ps872hk765daj8ct84|at|}
|ht|q|at|The first hand above is clearly better than this balanced
hand with the same hearts and high cards. It would be
nice if our method of counting total points took the
side suit singleton into account.


|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


cs|2|at|^^^-{We should be counting points for ^*Ishort suits^*N when we think about raising opener's suit.}

|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Here's how short suit points work:

|cs|2|at|^-{When raising a suit that partner has bid, count short suit points, not long suit points. Count
1 short suit point for each side suit doubleton, 3 for each singleton, and 5 for each void.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|So the hand we just saw:|
ht|h|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1hp?|at|}
|ht|g|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|ps8hk765daj87ct842|at|}
^^
is worth 11 total points once partner opens the bidding with 1@H. There are still 8 HCP, but the singleton spade is worth 3 short suit points.

|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


cs|4|at|Notice how this hand became ^*Ibetter^*N after partner opened 1@H. The hand was worth only 8 total points before partner bid hearts. Once the responder knows he is going to be raising, 3 additional total points are added in the form of short suit points for the singleton spade.

^-{The number of total points a hand is worth sometimes ^*Ichanges^*N as the bidding develops.
This adjustment of total points during the bidding is known as reevaluating your hand.}
^-
The above hand reevaluates to 11 total points after partner opens the bidding with 1@H.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|Once partner opens 1@H this hand reevaluates to 11 total points - too much for a single raise that promises to deliver a hand in the 6 to 9 total point range.

|ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1hp2h|at|}
|ht|d|cs|3|at|^P{|ih|ps8hk765daj87ct842|at|}

|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ht|e|cs|1|at|^C{|ia| 1hp3h|at|}


|n#|5|at|The correct response to partner's 1@H opening bid with this hand is 3@H, a jump raise.
|cs|2|n#|7|at|^-{In our bidding system the jump raise of a major suit opening bid promises 10 or 11
total points and at least 3-card trump support. Another name for this bid is a limit raise.}
^-|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


n#|7|at|Like its little brother, the single raise, the limit raise of a major suit opening sends 2 messages from the responder to the opener. The first of these messages is the same as it was for the single raise:
|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


n#|6|cs|4|at|^-{1. I know that the major suit you opened should be the
trump suit as we must have at least an 8-card fit in that suit.}

|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


cs|1|at|{2. I have almost enough total points to insist on a game contract in your major suit.
Please go on to the 4-level unless your opening bid is based on a very minimum hand.}

at|Let's figure this out by process of elimination. This hand is back to being worth only 8 total points. Do not count short suit points unless you are going to raise partner's suit. The hand has only 1 spade and we would need at least 3-card support to raise.

There are 3 new suits that each contain 4 cards, but we cannot bid any of these suits without going on to the 2-level. We already know that 10 total points are required for a new suit bid at the 2-level and this 8-point hand does not quite measure up.

We can't raise spades and we can't bid a new suit. We have to bid something, however, as all hands with 6 or more total points should respond in some way to an opening bid of 1 of a suit. There is only 1 possibility.

|n#|5|at|This hand is extremely unbalanced as it contains 2 singletons. The singleton heart is not the end of the world as far as notrump is concerned. Your partner's 1@H opening promised a 5-card suit and he is very likely to have some high cards in hearts - the defenders are not likely to get rich from the heart suit against a notrump contract. The spade singleton is another matter as the defenders could easily win several spade tricks at notrump.

You would really like to bid clubs here to suggest your own long suit as trump. Unfortunately, you would have to bid 2@C to mention that suit and you do not have the 10 total points that a 2-level response in a new suit demands. Since raising partner's hearts is out of the question and since this hand is too strong to pass, a 1NT response is the only alternative. You don't have a good hand for notrump, but you have to bid 1NT, nonetheless, in our bidding system.

Respond 2@D, not 3NT. This balanced hand with 18 total points looks just right for a 3NT response. The hand is flawed for a 3NT response because it contains 3-card support for partner's known 5-card major. There is a danger that partner might pass your 3NT response, not expecting 3-card support for his major. Your known 8-card major suit fit could be lost forever.

It is best to start with 2@D on this hand. You don't have to worry about your partner passing this forcing bid. You will be able to describe the strength of your hand as well as your spade support later in the bidding (you will learn how to do this soon).

This is one area of our bidding system that is not very intuitive. Remember that we already have a way of describing hands with support that are too strong for a 10-11 point limit raise - we start with a forcing bid of a new suit and plan to show our strength and support later.

If the next 3 players pass then 4@S will become the contract. You may think that's not so great - South has a minimum 13 total point hand and North has only 8 total points. These hands do not have even close to the 25 combined total points that a 4@S contract is suppose to require.

Luckily, point count does not really work here. Try counting the losers between the 2 hands. The @SA is the only missing high card in the majors. South's singleton club and North's singleton diamond will limit North-South's minor suit losers to 2. With only 3 losers North-South should be able to win 10 tricks and succeed in 4@S, despite holding only 21 combined total points.|

Even if this hand had fallen within the range of a notrump response, the lack of major suit stoppers suggests that a club contract could be better than notrump.

This hand, with 7 HCP and 1 short suit point, is strong enough to keep the bidding going. With 3-card support for partner's known 5-card major it is best to raise at once. There is no reason to confuse the issue by introducing your 4-card spade suit. You already know that hearts is at least an 8-card fit. Let partner in on the good news.

Make a single raise to 2@D. 5-card support is good enough to raise a minor suit (4 cards will do in a pinch). Also, this response denies a 4-card major. This 8 total point hand (6 HCP and 2 short suit points) meets all of the qualifications for a 6-9 total point single raise to 2@D. If your 4-card suit had been a major (instead of clubs) it would have been correct to respond in that suit.|

Respond 2@D. This hand is worth 18 total points once partner opens 1@S (15 HCP and 3 short suit points). Despite holding 4-card support for partner's major there is no raise we can make to show this strong of a hand. The solution is to start with a forcing new suit bid.

2@D is the correct response. Partner will not pass and you will be able to show your strength and spade support later in the bidding.|

When the opening bid is 1NT the responder immediately knows a great deal about both the strength and distribution of the opening bidder's hand:

|cs|1|at|^-{Responder knows that the opening bidder has between 15 and 17 HCP.}

|cs|2|at|{Responder knows that the opening bidder has a balanced
hand (no singletons or voids and at most 1 doubleton).}
^-
|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


at|As the 1NT opening paints a very accurate picture of opener's hand, the responder is often in a position to immediately decide on the best strain and level for the contract. This is generally not the case when the opening bid is one of a suit. Suit opening bids are wide-ranging, both in terms of strength (13-21 total points) and distribution.

|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


at|The narrow HCP range of a 1NT opening lets the responder know right away if a game or slam contract is either possible or certain. If, for example, the responder has 11 total points he will know that the partnership has between 27 and 29 combined points - more than enough for the game contracts of 4@S, 4@H, and 3NT (requiring 25 combined total points), but not enough for 5@D, 5@C, or any slam contract.

|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


at|The 1NT opening also tells responder that the opener has at least 2-card support for all 4 suits, which will often allow the responder to know the best strain at once. For example, when responder is dealt any 6-card suit he will know that the partnership has at least an 8-card fit.|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |

Raise to the game contract of 3NT. With 10 HCP and 1 long suit point the partnership is certain to have more than the 25 total points that 3NT requires, even if the opening bid is based on a minimum hand of 15 HCP. There is no need to worry about an 8-card major suit fit as partner is unlikely to have a 5-card major for his 1NT opening. Don't worry about your lack of major suit stoppers either. Partner has a lot of high cards and it is very likely that he has stoppers in both major suits.

Respond with 4@H (a game contract). You have 10 total points (8 HCP and 2 long suit points). The partnership must have at least the 25 combined total points required for 4@H. You know hearts is the strain of choice as the partnership must have at least an 8-card fit in that major suit.|

pg| ***** 186 ***** |


at|In a sense, a signoff bid is the opposite of a forcing bid. A signoff bid tells partner that you know what the contract should be and that he must pass. A forcing bid suggests that you need more information to know what the contract should be and that partner must not pass.

As with forcing bids, the rules of bridge do not demand that a player respect his partner's signoff bids. It is perfectly legal for the 1NT opening bidder not to pass after both of the above bidding sequences. It is legal for opener to keep bidding here, but it would be a horrible idea for him to do so. The opener has already described his hand, allowing the responder to make the final decision for the partnership.

at|The first hand has only 4 total points (2 HCP and 2 long suit points). Even if the notrump opener has a maximum hand with 17 HCP there is no way that the partnership has even close to the 25 combined total points that a game contract requires. This hand would like to signoff in a partial contract. There is a known 8-card fit (or better) in the spade suit. It would be nice to play in 1@S, but the 1NT opening makes this impossible. How about 2@S?

|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


at|The correct bid is 2@S. A new suit by responder is forcing opposite a 1 of a suit opening bid, but it is a signoff bid opposite a 1NT opening. The message of the 2@S response is: "I already know you have a strong hand partner, but I have a weak hand with long spades. Please leave me alone and let me play a contract with spades as trump at the lowest possible level!"|

ht|u|n#|5|at|Similarly, the second hand should signoff in 2@D. The chances are good that an 8-card fit exists in diamonds. Even if the opener has only 2 diamonds, the resulting 7-card fit could well be better than notrump (since responder has a weak and unbalanced hand).|

When responder signs off in a partial contract opposite a 1NT opening he is forced to go to the 2-level. That means that 8 tricks will be required for the contract to succeed as opposed to the 7 tricks that 1NT requires. Nevertheless, when responder is dealt a weak hand with a long suit, it is usually best to have that suit as trump despite the necessity of increasing the level of the contract.

Think about how many tricks these hands rate to be worth both at notrump and with their long suits as trump. Neither hand is likely to be of much help in winning tricks in 1NT. Both hands are likely to win several tricks, however, with their respective long suits as trump. The advantage of a trump suit will usually more than compensate for the extra trick that a 2-level contract demands.

nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|8 total points is a magic number when your partner opens 1NT.

Pass. With only 7 total points (all in HCP) you know a game contract is not recommended since partner has 17 HCP at most. You might have an 8-card fit somewhere, but you would be taking a big risk in signing off by bidding 2 of a suit. Diamonds is your longest suit, but you have only 4 of them. If partner has a doubleton diamond then 2@D will be a very silly contract.

This hand looks good for notrump anyway as it is very balanced and contains some useful high cards. Pass 1NT and let partner play there - he will thank you for providing such a nice dummy.

This 9-point hand is too strong to pass 1NT. If the opener has a hand with 16 or 17 HCP the partnership will have enough combined total points to try the game contract of 3NT. Yet, this hand is not quite strong enough to bid 3NT. If partner has a 15-point 1NT opening then 3NT rates to be too high (as there will be only 24 combined total points). What to do?

|

The 2@C response to a 1NT opening bid is the second example we have seen of a conventional bid.

This 8-point hand is only strong enough to invite game opposite a 15-17 HCP 1NT opening bid. If this hand contained no 4-card major it would invite by responding 2NT. With 4 spades, however, it is a good idea to investigate for an 8-card fit in that suit. Stayman does the trick.

Respond 2@S, a signoff bid. You have 6 total points (5 HCP and 1 long suit point). That's not enough for a game contract even if partner is at the top of his 15-17 HCP range. 2@S rates to be a better contract than 1NT with this unbalanced hand. Partner is certain to have at least 2 spades (as his 1NT denies holding any singletons or voids).|

Respond 3@H, a forcing bid. With 11 total points (10 HCP and 1 long suit point), a game contract is certain opposite partner's 15-17 HCP. If partner has 3-card support for hearts, an 8-card major suit fit will be present. He will raise to 4@H, likely the game contract of choice. If partner has only 2 hearts he will rebid 3NT which will probably turn out to be a good contract.|

The 33 combined total points that a small slam requires are sure to be present, but a grand slam (requiring 37 combined total points) is out of reach. The contract certainly belongs at the 6-level. The balanced nature of this hand points strongly towards notrump as the best strain. 6NT is very likely to be the best final contract. Let partner in on the news!|

If partner shows a 4-card major by bidding 2@H or 2@S, you will raise his suit to game, secure in the knowledge that an 8-card major suit fit has been found. If partner denies a 4-card major by bidding 2@D, you will place the contract in 3NT.|

Respond 2@C, the Stayman convention. This hand has 9 total points (8 HCP and 1 long suit point). That falls into the invitational range - you only want to get to game if partner is maximum.

To invite game on a hand with a 5-card major you should start with Stayman. If partner responds 2@S (showing 4 spades), your hand becomes strong enough to go to 4@S. If your partner responds 2@D or 2@H to your Stayman inquiry, you can then bid 2@S, suggesting a hand like this.|

Pass. You would like to signoff in clubs with this weak unbalanced hand, but there is no way to do it. 2@C would be Stayman and 3@C is a forcing bid that shows a very strong hand. 1NT may not be the best contract, but there is nothing you can do about it. You have to pass and hope for the best.|

If this hand contained another Ace, 3@C would be the correct response. It would then have 16 total points (14 HCP and 2 long suit points) - enough to invite a small slam.|

Stayman would be a disaster, however, if partner responded 2@D. Play it safe and pass 1NT. You may be better off in 2 of a major, but it is too dangerous to try to find out.|

Respond 7NT. You have 25 HCP. There are only 40 HCP in the deck so your partner must have the other 15 HCP. 37 combined total points is enough for a grand slam and you know that the partnership has more than that. Your partner will win all 13 tricks without breathing hard!

By the way, it is extremely rare to be dealt a hand this strong opposite a 1NT opening bid. If you are ever dealt a hand of this strength, you will know what to do!|

^n|cs|1|ia| 2cp?|at|}

|ht|g|n#|8|at|Recall that we use the 2@C opening bid to describe any hand with 22 or more total points that is unsuitable for a 3NT opening (which would show a balanced hand with 25-27 HCP). The 2@C opening is both artificial and forcing. That makes our first rule about responding to 2@C easy:

cs|3|at|^-{You must respond ^*Isomething^*N to a 2@C opening. The 2@C opening is forcing - never pass!}
^-
|
pg| ***** 327 ***** |


at|2@C is perhaps the easiest of all opening bids to respond to. Since the 2@C opening shows such a strong hand, the other 3 players tend to have weak hands after this opening has been made. The most common response to 2@C is 2@D, an artificial negative that carries the message: "I do not have a very good hand." All other responses to 2@C are called positive responses.

|
pg| ***** 328 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{When partner opens 2@C and you have less than 8 total points, always respond 2@D.
This 2@D bid is an artificial negative that denies the ability to make a positive response.}

|
pg| ***** 329 ***** |


cs|4|at|{Other responses to a 2@C opening are natural positives, promising at least 8 total points.}
^-
|
pg| ***** 330 ***** |


at|So, when partner opens 2@C you should always respond with a negative 2@D if your hand has less than 8 total points. This artificial bid says nothing about your diamond holding. All hands with 8 or more total points, should make some positive response.|
pg| ***** 331 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|The rules for which positive response to make are quite simple:

|cs|1|at|^-{The 2@H, 2@S, 3@C, and 3@D positive responses to 2@C show a good 5-card (or longer) suit.
Note that the 3@D positive is a jump bid since we use 2@D as an artificial negative.}

|cs|2|at|{With enough total points to make a positive response, but without a long enough
or strong enough suit for 2@H, 2@S, 3@C, or 3@D, make the positive response of 2NT.}

at|Respond 2@D, an artificial negative. Do not even think about passing 2@C, despite having such a horrible hand with long clubs. Partner could have a strong enough hand to make a game or slam contract without any help from you. He will not appreciate it if you pass his forcing opening bid. Don't worry about having only 1 diamond for this bid. 2@D is an artificial bid - it says nothing about your diamond holding.|

at|Respond 2NT, a positive response that denies a good long suit. This 13-point hand is a monster opposite a 2@C opening. Partner has promised 22 or more total points. A small slam (requiring 33 combined total points) is certain and a grand slam (requiring 37 combined total points) is not unlikely.

This hand has a nice heart suit, but it is only 4-cards long - a 2@H positive would require at least a 5-card suit. The positive response of 2NT is used when no suit positive is appropriate.|

Respond 3@D, a natural positive. Remember that the 2@D response to a 2@C opening is an artificial negative. You have to jump to the 3-level to make a positive response in diamonds. The 6-card length of the diamond suit and good spot cards in that suit makes up for the fact that this hand has only 4 HCP in diamonds. Besides, the only other possibility is a positive response of 2NT. Try to avoid the 2NT positive if your hand is unbalanced.

Your author's judgement is that a 2@H positive is the least of evils on this hand. 2@H is only wrong by one small heart, while 3@D on such an ugly suit, 2NT with a singleton, and 2@D on a 12 total point hand all seem like greater distortions.

2@D is the correct response on this hand, showing a negative hand (less than 8 total points). This hand is about as good as a negative hand can be.

Your partner opens with a weak 2-bid in hearts, showing a strong 6-card heart suit and less than 13 total points. Once partner has shown long hearts, this hand is worth 13 total points (9 HCP and 4 short suit points). It is most unlikely that the partnership has the 25 combined total points that 4@H requires. Does that imply we should pass?

We have seen that some opening bids (like 1NT and preempts) narrowly define opener's strength and distribution immediately. This is not the case when the opening bid is 1 of a suit.

Suppose that you open the bidding 1@C. Your partner knows that you have anywhere between 13 and 21 total points and at least 3 clubs. You could have lots of clubs and/or you could have 4-card support for any of the other 3 suits. In other words, the 1@C opening bid does not place a very narrow limit on either opener's strength or his distribution.

|
pg| ***** 451 ***** |


at|Suppose now that your partner responds 1@H, a forcing bid promising 6 or more total points and 4 or more hearts. It is your turn to rebid and you should use this opportunity to tell your partner more about your hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|n#|5|at|One of opener's primary missions with his rebid is to limit the strength of his hand to a much narrower range than the 13 to 21 total points shown by the opening bid.

The last example is special because opener's new suit rebid does not specifically place opener's strength into only 1 category. This rebid could be based on either a minimum (13-15) or a medium (16-18) strength hand. It cannot be based on a maximum strength hand.|

ht|u|at|It is usually not that hard for a minimum opener to decide upon his rebid. First, he checks to see if he has support. If he does, he raises. Next, he looks to see if he has any new suits to show. If he does, he bids a new suit. Next, he checks for extra length in the suit he opened. If he has extra length, he rebids his suit. Otherwise, he rebids in notrump.

ht|m|at|This hand has 13 HCP and add a short suit point for the doubleton now that you are considering a raise. Your hand is worth 14 total points and falls right in the middle of the 13-15 range of minimum hands. Your 4-card support is about as much as partner could ever hope for.

cs|4|at|When opener raises responder, he is sending the message that he accepts responder's suggestion of a trump suit. Responder promises only 4 cards in hearts for his 1@H bid which is why it is desirable for opener to have 4-card support for a raise. That is the only way that opener can be sure of an 8-card fit.

ht|q|at|Your partner will know that you have a 13-15 total point hand with long clubs. He will also know that you lack support for hearts or the ability to bid a new suit. That 2@C rebid goes a long way towards describing your hand to your partner.

This rebid is not even close to being forcing. Partner knows that you have 15 total points at the most and that clubs rates to be a reasonable trump suit. He is welcome to pass your 2@C rebid if his hand is too weak to explore for a game contract.

ht|p|at|Opener's 1NT rebid reveals a great deal of information to the responder. The 1NT rebid shows a balanced minimum and denies the ability to raise, show a new suit, or rebid the suit that was opened. It is nice to have stoppers in the unbid suits for this rebid, but 1NT is sometimes the best choice without stoppers.

Raise to 2@H. Your first priority is to raise partner. There is no good reason to introduce your spades as you already know that the partnership has at least an 8-card major suit fit in hearts. With 14 total points (13 HCP and 1 short suit point) this hand falls in the range of the single raise (showing 13-15 total points).|

Rebid 1@S. Your 6-card club suit is good enough to rebid, but showing a new suit is a higher priority than showing extra length in the suit that was opened. Partner might still have 4 spades.

The alternative, a 1@S rebid, is inferior. 2NT gets the nod because this rebid immediately limits both the strength and the distribution of your hand. A 1@S rebid, however, could be based on either a minimum or a medium hand - it does not limit opener's strength. Also, a 1@S rebid could be based on either a balanced or an unbalanced hand - it does not limit opener's distribution.

A maximum opener (with 19-21 total points) must ensure that the partnership reaches at least a game contract (since responder's 6 promised total points ensure that 25 or more combined total points are present). A maximum opener has 4 ways to force to game:|

The last of these rebids, a jump in a new suit, does not take the partnership to game at once, but it does create a game force. Responder must not pass when opener makes a jump rebid in a new suit. We use the term jump shift to describe this type of maximum rebid.|

at|^^Rebid 2NT, showing a balanced hand with 22-24 HCP. This hand has 23 HCP, too strong for a 20-21 2NT opening bid and not strong enough for a 25-27 3NT opening bid. The range between the 2NT and 3NT openings is shown by opening 2@C and rebidding 2NT. This 2NT rebid is non-forcing, but responder would have to be very weak to pass.

at|^^Rebid 3@D, your longest suit, even though your spades are stronger than your diamonds. It's kind of strange that your partner will end up as declarer if diamonds are trump.|
