	^dThis for those who want to localize ^*b aaBridge ^*n (and / or lin files) to a new language.

^b@2^*bQ.^*n   @2What is   ^*bLocalization^*n  ? 

|cp|red|at|^*b^bA|cp||at|.^*n    @2^*bLocalization^*n is where you adapt,  an existing application  OR  some content,  to a new language.

Compare that to ^*b Internationalization^*n (google - ^*bi18n^*n), which is where you change an application so that it can be localized by other people.  ^*b aaBridge ^*n is an Internationalized application.
^b@2
The  ^*b Books-Z ^*n(Inserted-menu-Z) folder contains an example of a localized lin file.  The file text is the first verse of the Poem 'If'  by  Rudyard Kipling in Chinese, English and French.
