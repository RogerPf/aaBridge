^b@2^*bQ.^*n   @2What is a     ^*bDouble Dummy Solver^*n      (DDS) ? 

|cp|8|at|^*b^bA.^*n|cp||at|   It is a piece of code that takes a deal and a contract e.g. "hearts" and by looking at all four hands (hence the expression Double Dummy) can check all the combinations of plays and so work out (assuming best play) the most tricks that each side can make.

A  how to use the Double Dummy solver  document is available called

^b@2^*bQ.^*n   What is a the Analyser ?  

|cp|8|at|^*bA.^*n|cp||at|   When you are  ^*bInside a Deal^*n  and have switched on the ^*bDDS^*n  then in addition to the green and amber ovals you will see a button saying  ^*bAnalyse^*n, meaning analyse  ^*bTHIS DEAL^*n.   Clicking this button will take the existing deal and pass it to the DDS which will then return with a table of who can make what in which contacts.

This table is displayed with 20 entries (4 seats by 5 denominations).  Hovering over any entry will tell you how many can be made by that declarer.  Clicking on a entry will set that as the contract and allow you to play the cards of THAT deal in the new contract.   ^*bOR^*n  by just looking at the ovals you will be able to see the more complex winning lines more easily.


|fp|3|cp|2|at|Hint|fp||at|^*n      Select the ^*bAutoPlay^*n TAB (right column) and switch to both sides auto play.  
Once finished you can use  ^*bReview^*n  to inspect the chosen line (with the DDS ovals showing) and so investigate an optimal line.|cp||at|^*n


^b@2^*bQ.^*n   Some deals appear to take a long time to Analyse ? 

|cp|8|at|^*bA.^*n|cp||at|   Yes  -   a very few, normally especially created deals, can take along time to Analyse, aaBridge will pause until the analysis is complete.   

^*bAdvice:^*n  Don't use the Analyser or even the DDS on such 'created' deals.|
