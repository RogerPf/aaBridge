ht|f|at|    @.  You can have two copies of  ^*baaBridge^*n  open at once  -  one reading this, the other following along.
|n^|9|at|	
On the aaBridge  ^*bWelcome^*n  page is a button marked  { ^*bPlay Bridge^*n }  click that.
In the right hand column the  ^*bNew Deals^*n  tab will now be showing.  
Click on a radio button   eg:   ^i ^*b31+  H Slam two Suit 4-4, 4-3^*n
                      ^gOR      ^i ^*b32+  6NT  -  Easy or Hard ?^*n
|n^|c|at|
Click the 5th  |cp|red|at| ^*b'Interesting'  Deal Selector^*n |cp||at|  button   (hard)
Next click the   { ^*bNew Board^*n }   button  center left.
|n^|9|at|
Once the new board appears (after a few moments) you can use the ^*b Hide / Show ^*n  button to quickly examine the deal and see if the target, here 12 tricks, will be easy to make,  allow yourself to take any finesses that will make and to drop singleton Kings and take easy ruffs.
|n^|4|at|
If you decide it will be too easy to play click   { ^*bNew Board^*n }   and examine the next deal.
|n^|9|at|
When you think you have one that is not so simple, for safety, click ^*b Save ^*n (top right).  Now click ^*b Hide ^*n (was labelled as ^*b Show ^*n) and play it out against the computer.  With luck you may have hit an interesting endplay or even a squeeze.|

|cp|green|at|^*bHint^*n  |cp||at|If you see the aaBridge bots choose a particularly poor defense, please follow the hint that will be displayed and start the bots off on a better line.  (It is very hard to write bots that can, pick the line of play, that ^*b human beings ^*n will find most difficult).|
