^B@2hondo717: Yes, well bid and played, but of course I have a few comments : First, kia's 3N bid is very clear. he has 5 HCP, so the minimum they have is 25 HCP, usually enough for game.  kia also has a pretty good 5 card suit, which will often be a good source of tricks. So, for example, even without the J of spades, he still should bid 3N. Granted, if kia wanted to be a pessimist, if aggie has a small doubleton diamond, his diamonds are not worth much, but that is very unlikely. Therefore, 3NT is pretty clear cut.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, as to the play. aggie took the right approach. The only suggestion I have regards the diamond suit. If you have a 9 card suit between you, missing the K and J, it is best to play the Ace first. Quite often a singleton honor will drop. And if that doesn't happen, then it will be clear what to play when moe plays something on the 2nd diamond. So, attacking the diamonds immediately was correct aggie. it's just that a better play would be to play the A first.

@D@Dnome: As in all the boards, before clicking the forward arrow you can play this hand double dummy.|

PG| ***** 26 ***** |


SB|W6-10 and I cannot bid 2NT.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: I will explain how you figure out what to bid.  You have 19 points. So  the minimum number of points between you two is 6+19 = 25 = 3NT. If you had 16 or so, you would bid 2N, inviting kia to bid 3N with a max 1N bid.  Because with 16, unless kia had 9 or 10, you don't want to be in game. The basic idea is that if you know as opener you should be in game, then bid it. So with 18+ points you should bid 3N, with a 16 or 17 bid 2N.|

^B@2hondo717: A very hard hand, but you can play it slightly differently kia but still end up with the same number of tricks. Let us analyze it a bit more. You can count 2 spades, 2 diamonds, and 3 clubs for sure. The problem is, you only have one entry to your hand. So you get only one chance to finesse in the black suits. First of all, you should take the club finesse at trick one hoping that I have the club Q and get 4 club tricks if it works. Then, you should play A of diamonds, low spade to the K, and another diamond.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Finding the club finesse failed you might as well try spade finesse, since that is the last time you will be in your hand. Next, you will find out that the spade Q is offside as well, and the hand is hopeless. The bidding was fine, and hand just not makable. |

^B@2hondo717: ok, let me discuss how to respond to a takeout double. 
With less than 10 points, bid your best suit as cheaply as possible
With an invitational hand, 10 or 11, jump in your best suit 
With an opening (game forcing) hand, cue bid the opponent's suit. In this case, since I have an opening hand, I will bid 2@C. |

^B@2hondo717: First some comments on the play. Then I want to discuss moe's double. moe did a very good job counting his winners. the heart play at trick 2 was correct. He can count 5 diamonds, 2 hearts, and 2 clubs for sure. so the contract makes. His plan was well thought out. One other minor issue on the play.  When aggie gets in with the A of hearts, the spade is a good play.  Although on opening lead, we lead A from AK, in the middle of the hand, it is better to lead K from AK. Because, when moe doesn't take the A, then kia knows aggie has it. Whereas, when she leads the ace, kia is not sure who has the K.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, as to moe's takeout double  Here are my guidelines for takeout doubles. they are my opinion, not absolutes.
First of all, you should have an opening hand.  moe is just a smidgen short, as he does not have an opening hand by the rule of 20. Further, I tend to subtract one point for 4-3-3-3. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: The other guideline I like for takeout doubles is to have 4 cards in the unbid major(s). That works great if the opponents open a major, but if the opponents open a minor, it is less likely you will have 4 cards in both majors. I play if the opponents open a major, your takeout double should promise 4 cards in the other major. If they open a minor, you are allowed to have one 4 card major and one 3 card major -a total of seven card of both majors. So, because moe's hand is both slightly short of points, and slightly short of major suit cards, I would pass it. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: however, many people would double with moe's hand. It is more a matter of style. I like my guidelines, but you and your partner simply need to agree. Now, let us assume moe passed. How do we get to 3N, which is a good contract. East should pass regardless of whether moe doubles or passes. So after passes by moe and kia, I would bid either 1@D, or more likely make a takeout double myself because I meet my guidelines of having 7 cards in the unbid majors. Also, I didn't mention that in balancing seat, the rules for doubles need to be relaxed, in order for you to be able to compete effectively. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, moe has a couple of choices.  Either 2@D or 2@C (cue bid) or 2N  which I like better.  Anyway, if he bids 2@C, 2@D, or 2N, we get to 3N. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


AT|
nome: And with a pass by moe, I am too weak for inverted minor raises. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: Yes, I think you are too weak for 3#C, although some people might bid it. One problem with your bidding 3@C with that weak a hand is that partner might put you in game if she has a strong hand herself. I play that you pretty much need at least 5 HCP to make an inverted raise. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: One of the kibs asked about Rule 20. Let me explain it now. The rule of 20 is one method, that I recommend, to determine if you have an opening hand. You take your HCP, plus the length of your 2 longest suits. If that adds up to 20, you have an opening hand. So, if you have 11 HCP, and a 5 card suit and a 4 card suit, that is 11 + 9 = 20
hondo717: however, if you are 5-3-3-2 with 11 HCP, that only adds up to 19 (11 + 5 + 3.)   |

^B@2hondo717: Interesting hand. judy's bid of 3@D is a bit aggressive, but I like it. The singleton heart is very valuable. When the opponents have a long suit, a singleton in their suit is powerful. a void even more powerful. Because she has such a good suit, and heart shortness, despite her being a bit short of HCP, I think 3@D is a very reasonable choice. Next, I have to decide what to bid. By the law of total tricks, since I know we have a 10 card fit, 4@H is certainly one possibility. The reason I did not was I was hoping they would not bid game, and bidding 4@H is more likely to push them there than 3@H.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: So although bidding 4@H is reasonable, I decided tactically that 3@H was better. but one could make a case for either bid. Now, as to what norma should bid.  3@S pretty much guarantees a 5 card suit. The idea being that if judy had spades, she might make a takeout double. However, you do have a problem over 3@H. your spade suit is very good, so if you are willing to play in a 4-3 fit, 3@S might work out. And in this case it worked out very well. 5 diamonds goes down 1,  and 4@D is a bit of an underbid.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: So I think your choices are 5@D and 3@S.  As long as you understand that 3 spades promises 5, 3@S is ok. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


AT|
peppygal: I knew that, but had such a big count.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Right, 3@S is forcing, so that was a good choice. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


AT|
dae: Do you play    bid opposite overcall as forcing?? I don't. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, I think you should play new suit by partner of overcaller is forcing, just like new suit by responder is forcing. Otherwise, it is often hard to find the right game when partner of overcaller has a good hand.|

^B@2hondo717: Nicely played dorothy. First let me discuss why I bid the way I did. I did not bid 2@H over 1@S because the auction was still "live." By that I mean that it was not clear how good the combined hands of my opponents were. Since 1@S is forcing pretty much, I knew it was likely I would get another chance to bid. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


AT|
dae: Not really forcing  by passed hand? |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Right, that's why I said "pretty much."  Anyhow, once judy bids 2@C over 1N, it now is clear that my partner has some points, since 2@C is a weak bid.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: The point I am making here is by listening to the auction, I can determine if the points are evenly balanced or not. And once judy bids 2@C, it looks like they are, making it safer for me to now bid 2@H. 2@H is a bit aggressive, especially vulnerable, but as you have heard me say many times, better to be aggressive than not.  Now, as to the defense. It turns out, because of the bad heart break, the hand can be set. It is hard for norma to visualize, but here is a slightly better defense. |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: If norma ducks the second heart as well (recall my note after trick five), then dorothy is in trouble. If she plays a 3rd heart, removing hearts from dummy, then norma can take it and make dorothy trump a club.  That runs her out of trump (she drew three rounds and ruffed twice. Therefore, norma will score her 9 of hearts. That is an expert defense norma, so don't feel bad about not seeing it. |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: There is a defensive technique known as "forcing" declarer (to trump), which often works out well. Many less experienced players are reluctant to play a card that they know declarer will ruff, but, at worst, that is usually a neutral play, as declarer can do that themselves. Anyway, so it doesn't cost anything and sometimes, it can be used to run declarer out of trump, and therefore, score low cards or long trumps in defenders hand, as this deal demonstrates. So the bottom line is, do not be afraid to make declarer ruff. It is usually at worst neutral, and sometimes very effective. |

^B@2peppygal: I don't like my bid, but I have been scolded for not bidding it.
hondo717: Yes, I suggest you use the rule of 20 to determine if you have an opening hand, and follow it pretty much all the time. No expert player would pass your hand. |

^B@2hondo717: Now, I have an interesting bidding problem here.  norma made a nice bid of doubling 2 clubs, to show me she really has clubs. And we are not vul and they are, and I have virtually no defense, and have length in clubs. It is likely from my perspective that they are making 4@H.  So on average 5@C is probably the right bid. The only time it is wrong is if they are not making 4@H, it is not likely we are going down too many. |

^B@2hondo717: it turns out on that hand, they are down in 4@H, but only because of the way clubs are distributed. If clubs are either 3-1, or the K of clubs is in the other hand, 4@H makes. So, my sacrifice turned out not to work, but that was rather unlucky. almost all the time it will be right. As you know I can see all hands, I already knew that the sacrifice was not correct. But I made the bid I would have made had I not been able to see all 4 hands, and I feel confident it was correct. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717:And,  I would bid it again, looking at my hand and norma's because on average we would come out ahead.  The other thing that sometimes happens is, because the opponents know they have to beat you 4 tricks, they decide to bid at the 5 level. So, there are 2 reasons why the 5@C bid could work out well. Remember, you can go down up to 3 tricks in a sacrifice if you are not vul and they are. Thus, often a sacrifice at that vulnerability is a good bet.|

^B@2hondo717: Well it turned out you made 1N, so it worked out ok anyway.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT|
joyable: Should have kept a diamond for dorothy. Then down.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, you should. we will discuss the play shortly. But first let us discuss the bidding. norma has no perfect bid over 1@H. Her 3 choices are 1N, 2@C, and 2@H. I personally would have chosen 2@H. It is ok to raise with 3 card support, under special circumstances. The circumstances are, if you have a singleton or void, or if you have good 3 card support. |
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717:  So, in this case because her hearts are so good, 2@H is a reasonable bid. It is least of evils. And 2@H probably makes. The problem with 1N is that she  has no spade stopper. Finally, 2@c should promise a better club suits. Therefore, although a raise to 2@H tends to show 4, there are hands where you only have 3 card support, and partner must keep that in mind. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|
dae: 1 nt  just says balanced and no other good bid? |
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, that is what 1N says, but I felt that 2@H was a better choice on this particular hand. On another note, my hand is too weak to bid NMF. I either have to bid 2@H or pass. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, as to the play. norma you should pitch clubs from your hand, not diamonds. You can count six tricks for sure, 5 hearts and a diamond. The possibilities for another trick are either in clubs or diamonds. Once they finish with spades, they will probably lead a minor suit, and if you keep diamonds, that gives  you 2 chances for you 7th trick. However, once norma pitches diamonds, and dorothy leads the K of diamonds, judy should definitely keep a diamond, because she knows dorothy has the Q of diamonds at least. So, given the way the hand was played, it should be down 1.|

^B@2hondo717: First the bidding. kia made a nice bid of 3@C, with a six-four hand, and no spade points.  And my guidelines for whether or not to compete to 3@S are as follows:  
You should compete to 3@S if you know we have a nine card fit, which we don't from aggie's perspective. Or if you have a singleton or void in their suit, which aggie does. So 3@S was a good bid aggie, even though it happened to not work here. Further, your thought that the singleton club was an asset was correct.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now as to the play. kia made a great heart shift, and once they did that, you were sunk aggie. You can save one trick by ruffing the club high, but still down 2. One minor point. moe should probably cash the ace of hearts before giving kia a ruff, in case kia had 2 hearts.  Other than that, everyone did very well on this hand.|

SB|nI bid 2NT for feature.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


mb|2N|NT|
^B@2hondo717: Good, in this hand if I show a feature, which shows a max, you should bid 4@S. Because, 10 card fits are very powerful. And with no feature,  I would bid 3@S, and you would pass. However, let me teach you Ogust which I think is a better method over a weak 2.  With Ogust, I can describe my hand in terms of how good my suit is, and how good my hand is. My suit can either be a "good" suit or a "bad" suit. Let me explain further.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


SB|S|SB|N|NT|
^B@2A "good suit" is defined as having 2 of the top 3 honors.
A "good" hand is defined as being at the top of the weak 2 range, 8-10 HCP.
A "bad" hand is defined a being below the weak 2 range, 5-7 HCPs, some use 3-7HCPs.
All my responses to 2N are artificial, in that they have nothing to do with the suit I bid
3@C shows a "bad" suit and a "bad" hand. |AT|^m3@D shows a "good" suit and a "bad" hand.
3@H shows a good hand and a bad suit. |at|^M3@S show a "good" hand and a "good" suit. |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|
^B@2To summarize 3@C = bad hand/bad suit, 3@D = bad hand/good suit, 3@H = good hand/bad suit, 3@S = good hand/good suit. Or saying it differently, the minors show a bad hand and the majors show a good hand. So on this hand I bid 3@D, which shows 5-7 points, and a suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. Since you only have 13 hcp, you would bid 3@S, as we don't have enough points for game. Had I bid 3@H or 3@S, showing a good hand, you would have bid 4@S.|

^B@2nome: I needed the 9th. trick and had only one spades stopper. Both opponents were dangerous because if South was out of spades could play a diamond and put North in the lead with the killing spades. Hearts was the only place i could get the extra trick if I could correctly place the @HQ. I chose North having the Q and was wrong. I thought to get my obvious eight winners first and worry about the ninth later. That way I would have been down only one which makes sense after the facts are in. Had I played for the Q being with South I had the contract in the bag.|
PG| ***** 260 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: ok, you need to come to 9 tricks, you can count 5 clubs and a spade and 2 hearts. Based on the bidding, it is likely that aggie has the A of diamonds. So, you were right, that you must try for a 3rd heart trick. However, because you are missing the 10, your best play is to finesse the J and hope I have the Q. The way you played the suit, if aggie has the Q and covers, you still only have 2 heart tricks.  Granted, aggie might not cover, if she does not have the 10.  Right, you might as well play for the legitimate make, as opposed to the opponents making a mistake. |
PG| ***** 261 ***** |


NT|
^B@2moedraznin: All he needed was 1 more, if aggie does not cover once, he can go to town.|
PG| ***** 262 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: But if she does cover, then he only gets 2 heart tricks. On the other hand, if you run clubs, we might have trouble discarding, and you might get some clues as to hearts and diamonds. In general, the best line is to run clubs and then play heart to the A heart back to the J. |

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at|

* To respond to a takeout double: 
    With less than 10 points, bid your best suit as cheaply as possible;
    With an invitational hand, 10 or 11, jump in your best suit; 
    With an opening (game forcing) hand, cue bid the opponent's suit.

* It is better be aggressive than not.

* Do not be afraid to make declarer ruff. It is usually at worst neutral, and sometimes very effective.

* Use the rule of 20 to determine if you have an opening hand, and follow it pretty much all the time.

* Often a sacrifice when you are not vulnerable and they are is a good bet.

* A "reverse" is defined as|CP|8|AT| voluntarily |CP||AT|bidding past your suit at the 2 level, as opener.

* It is ok to raise responder's major with good 3 card support, particularly if you have shortness elsewhere. 

* A new suit by an unpassed responder (whether partner opened or overcalled) is forcing.

 She was not even trying to hide the pity and sarcasm in her voice. 

Down but not totally out, in spite OF well founded sarcasm I decided to carry on. Who knows, as Howard occasionally says, "kia's bid (wish) though extremely aggressive may not be too unreasonable."   Therefore, this week and each week thereafter I shall devote one page to important instructions by Howard collected from his weekly sessions and I am going to do what I said I would. Now please click the forward arrow if you wish to go along. At the bottom of thIS page you can find the link to the site to listen to the Emperor Concerto. So, click the link, set yoour speakers as high as you wish, wait for a few moment for the introduction and then start reading the PEARLs with me.
