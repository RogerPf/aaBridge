hondo717: |cp||at|Let me discuss the 2H response to 2C, and then the follow ups.  Many people play that a 2@H response to 2@C shows a hand with no aces or kings. It doesn't really limit your point count, just limits your hand in terms of aces and kings. When you play 2@H showing no ace and king then  a 2@D bid promises at least one ace or king. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The reason aces and kings are important is that, 2@C is a game force, and aces and kings become much more important when bidding slam. It is nice for the 2@C bidder to know if partner has no aces or kings, and can avoid unnecessarily trying for slam. Another important point is, 2@C is forcing to game as far as responder is concerned. So, dee can make bids below game, and I cannot pass. For example, dee can bid 2@S, and I cannot pass.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|If she does that, we get to 4 spades, which is a better contract than 3N.  dee was a bit unlucky in that terry found a terrific defense, but 4@S is cold no matter what. It is important to remember that 2@C  is a game force. The only exception is if dee bids 2N over 2@H. in that case she is showing 22-24, so if I have 0-2, I could pass. But any other bid by dee cannot be passed by responder if it is below game.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Let us first discuss the defensive technique I employed. It is called making declarer lose control of the hand. If you can run declarer out of trumps, then you end up playing NT, and can run tricks in your long suit. That is what happened on this hand. Many less experienced players are reluctant to let declarer trump tricks. However, at worst, that can be a neutral play, as it rarely costs your side a trick. And, sometimes, as on this hand, it can cause declarer to prematurely run out of trumps.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Ok. A few things to discuss on our inaugural hand. First of all the bidding. Had Ira passed, pam has a classic "limit raise with 3 card support" hand. If Ira passes, she would bid a forcing 1N, and, assuming ally bids 2 of a minor (which she wouldn't on this hand), pam would then bid 3@S. That is the standard way in 2 over 1 of showing a limit raise with 3 card support. Bid the forcing NT and then jump in opener's major on the next round. However, once Ira bids 2@C, that option is not available to pam and  she has no good alternatives.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|She can either bid 2@S, which is a slight under bid,  bid 3@C, which shows a limit raise with 4 trumps (and she has only 3),  or bid 2@D, which is forcing, but her diamond suit is pretty bad. Because her spades are so good, I think I would have chosen 3@C myself, but I do not fault 2@S. It worked out fine anyway, since ally can bid game as she has a strong hand.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|As to the play. ally has 10 tricks for sure if trumps behave. However, she should make 5. The reason she should make 5 is, since she has KJ10 of clubs, she can knock out the AQ of clubs and take a club trick. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, the kibs have brought up some other interesting points, which I would like to discuss. First, some people play you can cue bid a limit raise with 3 card support. I personally do not like that, because I like to know if pard has 3 card or 4 card support. A 9 card fit plays, on average 1/2 to 3/4 of a trick better than an eight card fit with the same number of HCP. So, I prefer to have the limit raise promise 4 card support, because it allows opener to better judge when to bid close games. But, if you and your partner want to play cue bid only promises 3 card support, that is fine. you just need to agree. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The other point that was brought up, is 1N forcing by a passed hand. If you do not play Drury, 1N still has to be forcing, otherwise you can't handle a hand such as pam's, a limit raise with 3 card support. My recommendation is you play 1N forcing, even by a passed hand, because it is a nice flexible bid, and can be used to get you to the right spot on many hands. However, again, you have to have a partnership agreement about that.|

PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, that was a very good contract. So, when I tell you what I didn't like about the bidding, lol, you can call me crazy. How about just 6N pam, or 4C? Now, let us discuss slam tries over a 2N opening bid.  There is a concept known as 4N quantitative, which is what pam's bid is supposed to mean.  First, with pam's hand, since she knows they have a minimum of 35 HCP, she can just bid 6N. At the very least as she noted, she should be worried about missing 7, which without some sophisticated conventions, hard to find.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|In fact, 7@D is a good contract, but 7N is not. In 7N, unless you get a club lead, you have a spade loser. However, in 7@D, you can ruff your spade loser. Now, let me explain the mechanics of 4N quantitative. If partner opens 1N or 2N, and responder bids 4N, many people play that as a "quantitative 4N." What responder is saying is, "partner we may have slam; if you have the top or your range, bid 6." Here, if pam had 12 points or so, since she knows ally has 20 or 21, she knows they are close to slam.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|So, with a 12 point balanced hand, pam might bid 4N quantitative, asking ally to bid 6N with 21 points, or 20 points and a good 5 card suit. Since ally had 5 diamonds, and they were pretty "chunky", I think 6N over a quantitative 4N is reasonable. On the other hand, if you play quantitative 4N, how do you distinguish between quantitative 4N and Blackwood? |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|This is the method I recommend. The only auctions where 4N is quantitative are as follows:
1N-4N, 2N-4N, 
2@C-2@D-2N-4N, 
1x-1y-1N-4N, and 
1x-1y-2N-4N
Those are auctions where the NT bidder's hand has a well defined range. On any other auction, 4N is still Blackwood.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|And, if you decide you never want to play quantitative, I think that is fine, as it rarely comes up. Now, a few words about Gerber. If you take those same quantitative 4N auctions and substitute 4@C for 4N, 4@C is Gerber on those auctions. I play, that is the only time Gerber applies. Otherwise 4@C is natural. Now then, if you decide to play Gerber and possibly 4N, you have to agree with partner under what narrowly defined circumstances they apply.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|Ok, final point which is 2@C-2@D-3NT-4NT. First, you have to decide what 2@C-2@D-3N-4@C is. Most play that as Stayman. If you play that as Stayman, then, to ask for aces you can bid Stayman and then bid 4N. Further, if you want, you could play 2@C-2@D-3N-4N is also quantitative, although if you just wanted to play that as ace asking, that would be ok too.|

hondo717: |cp||at|Ok, let us discuss the auction a bit. My 3@C bid is a little aggressive, particularly vulnerable, but I wanted to put a bit of pressure on the opponents. Even if Ira has nothing at all, I can count six tricks, and it is unlikely that I will be doubled, since my clubs are so good, and it is hard to double a part score unless you have  some trump values. Therefore, my 3C bid was a calculated risk.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at| Next, I have one comment on my defense at trick three. Normally, you should not underlead an ace, even though I did with the A of diamonds. However, this hand illustrates a common situation where it is ok to underlead an ace.If you have the A, and there is KJ on the board, it is ok to underlead an ace, because declarer must guess as to whether to put up the K or J. |

Many experts do not agree with me, but my experience tells me that more often than not, the value of preempting far outweighs the few times you might miss a 4-4 fit. And even if you have a 4-4 fit, often it is just as good or better to play in opener's 6 card suit. I think it is more a matter of style.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|But assuming ally passed, she can bid 2@H over 2@D.  Since I have another suit besides @C, and Ira has @D, it is highly probable that my other suit is hearts or spades  and ally has support for both.|

camilleln: I passed because I knew you had a chance to bid your second suit and had no idea in DONT that you wouldn't.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, the problem with your argument is, I don't know you have support for my 2nd suit. you have to tell me. It is dangerous for me to bid it unilaterally. It is much easier if I know you have support.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, let us look at pam's opening weak 1N. Although technically she meets the requirements of 12-14 HCP, I usually pass 4-3-3-3 12 counts in first and second seat. In general, I tend to discount 4-3-3-3 hands by a point, and you will note that pam's hand does not meet the rule of 20. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Next, let me discuss why I prefer DONT or natural to CAPP. I like DONT because it lets you keep the bidding at a lower level  compared to CAPP. The downside of DONT is you cannot make a penalty double of 1N. However, in real life, I have found that you rarely do well doubling 1N, even a weak NT. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|Now as to Lebensohl. It is a complicated convention, and I don't recommend you play it if you play strong NT. I recommend you use "stolen bid" doubles and systems on if you play strong NT and there is interference. However, playing the weak NT, where there is often interference, I have found Lebensohl works well. Without getting into too much detail, let me describe a few of the basics of Lebensohl.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Suit bids are natural (other than a cue bid of the opponent suit). 2 level bids are to play, 3 level bids are a game force. So, in this hand, ira's 2@D bid is a desire to play 2@D. I suspect that playing Lebensohl except over double and 2@C works well with strong NTs, but not as well with weak NTs.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, it turns out seven is cold, but hard to bid. Now, let me discuss this auction, and why I chose the bids I did.  Everything through 2@C was pretty straight forward. My 2@S bid was "fourth suit forcing" which  is a convention that takes effect when responder bids the only remaining suit.  The idea is, if opener has already bid 2 suits, it is unlikely that opener has support for the remaining suit.  Bidding the remaining suit is an artificial bid. It merely establishes a game forcing auction.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|My next bid will clarify why I bid the fourth suit. In this particular case, I wasn't sure where the final contract should be, NT, diamonds, or possibly even hearts.  Opener should continue to bid naturally over 4th suit forcing. ally has a few choices:
if she has a spade stopper she can bid 2N;
if she has heart support she can bid 3@H. I already know she doesn't have 4 card support, since she didn't raise right away. In general, ally's 3@H bid should promise 3 card support. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|I would have chosen 3@D with ally's hand, although ally's doubleton heart support is quite good, given she only has two, so I think 3@H has some merit. But she is showing 3 card support, so it is a bit of a lie. Anyway, once she bids 3@H, I am pretty sure we want to be in slam.  She should be short in spades, since she has bid diamonds, clubs, and hearts. I have control of all the side suits. But, I was worried about making seven, but decided to just bid six right away. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The reason I chose diamonds instead of hearts is I thought ally could throw away her losers on my long hearts.  The reason I didn't bid 4N is because of my void in clubs. Had I bid 4NT, I suppose if she shows 2 aces, I could think about 7, as I know we have a 10 card diamond fit with the A and K. But, if she shows one ace, as she will, I don't know whether it is the ace of clubs or the ace of diamonds. There actually is a convention known as "exclusion Blackwood" or "exclude clubs", where I can bid Blackwood, and tell ally to ignore clubs.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|But it is a bit involved, and I didn't want to go into it.  I neither play nor teach Exclusion Blackwood, because the need for it rarely comes up, and it is a bit complicated. I am not saying it is a bad convention, just that I do not give it much priority, as I feel there are many other more important things to learn first. In fact, I think this is only the first (or maybe 2nd) time I have encountered a hand on BBO in the last couple of years where it might have been useful. And even on this hand, I am not sure it would have gotten us to the grand slam, although without it, there was no way to bid the grand slam.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Let me just briefly expand a little bit further. Basically, if you jump in a suit, where it is clear you are trying for slam, that would be exclusion Blackwood. So, on our auction, 1@D-1H-2@C-2@S-3@H, exclusion Blackwood would work as follows (hearts is the presumed trump suit, even though I intended for us to end up in diamonds):
4@S - exclusion Blackwood for spades;
5@C - exclusion Blackwood for clubs;
5@D - exclusion Blackwood for diamonds.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Exclusion Blackwood is a bit more complicated than what I explained. For a more complete explanation, you can go to ^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/E/Exclusion_Blackwood_Voidwood.htm^*N. 
In this hand, if I bid 5@C over 3@H, that is exclusion Blackwood and except ally doesn't count the club ace as an ace when she answers.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his important @E@3instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|FP|2|cp|8|at|

^C@2** |FP||cp||at|I think any time you have 5-10 points and a six card suit (assuming you don't meet the rule of 20), you should open a weak two.|FP|2|cp|8|at|
 
** |FP||cp||at|Once you describe your hand, you can pass if you have no further information to give to partner.|FP|2|cp|8|at|
 
** |FP||cp||at|In modern bidding, there are many different kinds of raises available, depending on how many trumps you have, and how many points. It is important that you pick the correct one in every auction. In a competitive auction, where partner bids a suit and the next person overcalls, the cue bid as limit raise or better is an excellent bid. Therefore, if you raise without making a cue bid, that denies a limit raise. BTW, I play a cue bid promises 4 trumps, although some people will do it with three.

The reason I like it to show 4 card support is that a nine card fit is worth about half a trick more than an eight card fit with the same number of points, so partner can bid close games if they know you have a nine card fit.|FP|2|cp|8|at|
 
** |FP||cp||at|Odd/even discards are a defensive signaling system. It applies when |FP|2|CP|8|AT|the first time |FP||CP||AT|a defender discards, that is does not follow suit.  

If the defender discards an odd card, it means the defender likes that suit, and is showing some cards in that suit.
If the defender discards an even card, it means he/she does not like that suit.

If you play odd/even, I suggest you keep it simple -- odd encourages, even discourages and remember it is only the first time.

^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
