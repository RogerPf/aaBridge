^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

^B@2hondo717: terry, if you were going to pass 5@H, showing all the key cards, why bother to bid Blackwood to start with. You should never bid Blackwood until you have planned out what you are going to do with all the answers. Since there were only two key cards left, if you were planning on passing even if deb had both of them, you might as well have just played 4 hearts. |

^B@2hondo717: I understand, But deb gave you just about the strongest answer she could have, and you still passed at the 5 level. So, if you were planning to pass even if you had all the key cards, there is no reason for you to bid Blackwood. You needed to decide before you bid Blackwood whether you were going to slam or not. The 2@C and 2@S bids by terry were natural to answer kia'a question.|

^B@2hondo717: You did well deb. It was not an easy play. Now, back to my harangue on Blackwood. Before bidding Blackwood, you need to decide what you are going to bid based on all the answers you could receive from pard. If you are going to pass no matter what partner answers, then there is no reason to bid it, since you are going to be an extra level  higher. Unless terry wanted to make sure deb was up for the challenge, as she obviously was.  |

^B@2hondo717: Good bidding and playing. terry's 3@D bid shows a constructive spade raise, 4 spades and 7 to a bad 9 HCP. And deb, with 18HCP, clearly wants to go to game. Yes, terry is playing what is known as "reverse Bergen Raises", where 3@C shows a limit raise, and 3@D a constructive raise. I have a slight preference for Reverse Bergen over regular Bergen. The reason is, with Reverse Bergen, when partner has a limit raise, it gives you more room to explore for game and you are more likely to want to explore for game over a limit raise than over a constructive raise. On  BBO, Bergen Raises are alertable. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|
^B@2As far as bidding 3N, deb has a hand where she could bid 3N, balanced 18 with all suits stopped. But, as I said before, it is rare that 3N plays better than 4@S, when you have a 9  card fit. |

^B@2hondo717: Well, deb, let's see if we can plan out the hand better. although you are right, it probably does not make. You can count out 8 tricks for sure. 2 spades, 4 hearts, and 2 diamonds. And you are slightly worried about spades, since you only have two stoppers, and if I have 5, you will lose 3 spade tricks. So probably your best bet is to hope I have the Q of diamonds, and lead low towards the J. |

hondo717: Well done again deb.  |

NT|
^B@2Now let us discuss whether terry should bid 1@D or 1@S.  The modern tendency is to play what is sometimes known as "Walsh", bypassing bidding 1@D to bid a 4 card major over a 1 club opener.  So, assuming terry plays that, he should bid 1@S rather than 1@D.  It really depends on your style terry. Actually, the worse your hand is, the more important it is for you to show your major. If you have a strong hand and good diamonds, you can bid 1@D, intending to bid your major later. However, if your hand is only worth one bid opposite a min opener, as terry's is, then you should bypass diamonds and bid your major. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: You need to be consistent. Therefore, the basic rule is, if partner opens 1@C, and you have a hand that is worth only one bid, bid the major if you have it. Also, "walsh" is no longer alertable, since it is now common practice. |

PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Because terry overcalled, deb only needs 4 diamonds, and sometimes even 3, if she is short of spades. If terry had opened rather than overcalled 1@D, then, yes, deb should have 5 to make a limit raise in competition. There are also tactics for deb to consider here. She might decide that 3@D is more preemptive, so even though she has a limit raise, she might feel 3@D is a more effective bid. |

Pear: If you had a 6crd @S suit would a double here show that? |

hondo717: Exactly terry, double here by me is a "stolen bid" double, indicating I would have bid 2@S, showing 6 spades. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, because I am pretty certain deb and terry have a nine card fit, I know we have a fit somewhere as well, but I am not sure I want to possibly go to the 4 level, since deb has ... shown a strong hand. So I am going to reluctantly pass, but worry that we can make a part score somewhere. |

^B@2hondo717: Let us discuss whether or not kia should make a negative double. It is close. If his Q of diamonds was in another suit, he should make one for sure. The reason he can make a negative double, even with his hand, is that, since he has 2 spades, he can stand a 2 spade bid by me, and he has support for the other suits and is short ... in diamonds. Yes, if you felt in an aggressive mood, you could make a negative double, only because you have spade support. But pass is fine as well. With a stiff spade, you should pass for sure. In the next panel I will recap the negative double. |

^C@e@2A "negative double" is defined as a double made by responder after partner has opened and there has @E@3been an overcall. It typically denies enough points to make a free bid over the overcall. It shows at least 4 cards in the unbid major or majors. Usually, the negative doubler either has tolerance if partner rebids his suit, or a long suit of his own that he can bid (often the major) if he has no tolerance. Some partnerships play that the negative doubler promises both unbid suits, but the modern tendency is for it to just guarantee the unbid major.

You must decide through what level to play negative doubles. Most experts play negative doubles through either 3@S (which is what I do) or 3@H.

The number of points the negative doubler must have depends on to what level he is forcing the bidding. If opener must only bid at the 2 level, then the negative doubler can have as little as 6 or 7 points. If forcing to the 3 level, the negative doubler should have at least a good 8 or 9 and, if at the lower end, some nice outside feature such as shortness in the overcalled suit.

If responder has a 5 card suit and 10 or more points, he would tend to make a free bid of that suit. Therefore, since negative doubles at the 3 level tend to show 10 or more points, they also tend to show exactly 4 cards in the unbid major; otherwise responder would have bid the major directly.

One other thing to note. If responder makes a negative double, and then pulls opener's rebid to his own suit, that tends to show a weaker hand with a long suit. Here is an example auction (partner opens 1@D): 1@D-1@S-X-P-2@C-P-2@H. In this case, the negative doubler is showing a weakish hand with long hearts. If responder had 10 or more points and long hearts, he would have bid 2@H immediately. Making the negative double first allows him to show a weaker hand with long hearts.

^B@2hondo717: Normally you are supposed to lead partner's suit, but in this case a trump lead is called for, because of my long spades. However, if the lead is wrong, terry is allowed to say 'Howard, you lost the postmortem for not leading hearts' :)|

hondo717: Let us see what deb could have done. She has an awfully good hand. My recommendation would be to simply bid 4 spades over 1@H. that is likely to be a good contract  even if kia has nothing, including shortness in spades and clubs both, it will still probably make or be down one at worst. |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: In this case, "bid what you think you can make" works out the best. |

AT|
hondo717: you could Michaels also, but you can make 4S even opposite shortness in kia's hand, so I think just bidding spades is fine. |

^B@2hondo717: First, let me answer kia's question  about my taking "two bids." As responder, I am allowed to repeat my suit as cheaply as possible. That simply shows a long suit, not a good fit for terry, and a weak hand. What I couldn't do is bid 2@C with my hand, as that would show a hand stronger than what I had.  If responder switches suits at his second bid, that shows a stronger hand. The 2@H bid is to play. terry would normally pass in many cases. Now, let me discuss terry's hand. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: His hand is actually very much like the last one. terry has a good hand, yet did not describe it as such. Even though his diamonds are longer and stronger than his spades. there is a case to be made to open his hand 1@S, and then jump shift to 3@D. The reason being is that otherwise it is hard for him to show a 5 card spade suit. However, if he chooses to open 1@D, then his best bet is to probably be 2@S over 1@H.  In either case, we will get get to 3N, which is clearly our best contract. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|
^B@2bizmiz: Why didn't you bid NT? |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: The reason I did not bid 1N over 1@S is I felt my hand was too distributional, and would take more tricks in hearts than NT. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|
gavilanes: What about a weak jump shift in the form of two hearts?  or is there a flaw with that bid? |
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: my hand is too strong to make a weak jump shift. that usually shows around 3 or 4 points. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: When Terry bid 3@D isn't he showing a strong hand or just 6-4 distribution? |
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: 3@D is just showing 6-4 with good diamonds but not necessarily as good as his hand. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: so, the lesson on the last two hands is to let partner know when you have a good hand. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|
Pear: What was the preferred bid over 2@H please Howard? |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: The problem was your only bidding 1@S over 1@H terry. Once you do that, I can never figure out how good your hand is. You have to jump to 2@S to show a good hand. From my perspective, you could have some 12 or 13 count with 4 spades and probably 4 diamonds. Here are two possible sequences:
1@D-1@H; 2@S-3N
1@S-1N;  3@D-3N |

^B@2hondo717: We seem to be having the same lesson on all 3 hands regarding bidding, although in this case it worked out ok. With 17 HCP and 2 doubletons and good club support, kia has a very good hand. So I think 3@H would be a better bid than 2@H. Once deb bids 2@C, which, since they are playing sayc is not game forcing, kia knows they should be in game. As opener, you have an obligation to jump when you have a real good hand. |

^B@2hondo717: Let me discuss terry's lead. He made a "deceptive" 8 of diamonds lead, which fooled kia. so I am sure he thinks that is good. However, it also fooled me. and it is more important not to fool partner when defending. In this case, it didn't matter, but it might have. To kia, it looks like the 8 of diamonds is from top of nothing or 108xx or something like that. |

hondo717: kia was unlucky that spades broke 4-1. However, with proper planning the hand makes. Admittedly, even if terry has the 10 of diamonds, kia still probably has a diamond loser, so he might as well play the Q just in case terry had something like K10x. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: However, if I were declarer, I would assume I had one diamond loser from the lead, just like kia. He should plan on losing 1 spade and 1 diamond for sure. and maybe a club. So, he should win the A of diamonds, play a spade to the K. Now, take the club finesse, even if it loses, he is setting up club tricks on which he can pitch a heart or two. In this case the club finesse wins. Now he can play the ace of clubs, and another spade to the A. Then he can play the J of clubs, taking a "ruffing" finesse against me, to set up yet another club trick. This will let him get rid of his heart losers, but ruffing one heart, and pitching one on the good club. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: So, again the idea is for kia to give himself as many options as possible. the bad break is unlucky, but can be overcome.  As usual, it comes down to planning the hand at trick one. |
