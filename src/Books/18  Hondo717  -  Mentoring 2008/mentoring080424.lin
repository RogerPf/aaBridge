^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: Let us talk about lead directing doubles. Over 3 clubs, it is possible for deb to double, to tell terry to lead clubs. Honor wise she has a good lead directing double. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|  Badmonster: I worried that there wasn't enough to gain that if Terry had a great lead to discourage him from it. Length wasn't an issue. Not in a trump contract. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: That is possible, but I have found that, in general, if you have a good lead directing double, it is usually a good idea to double. You have about the min honor holding possible to make a lead directing double. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Opening leads are hard, and anything you can do to help pard usually works out well. Basically, any double of an artificial bid is lead directing. In this particular case, kia's 3@C bid is artificial, it says nothing about clubs, so a double by deb would indicate she wants a club lead. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Lead directing doubles come up in several other common situations - over Bergen, as on this hand and they often come up over Stayman,transfers and over responses to Blackwood.
hondo717: you should be on the lookout for opportunities to make lead directing doubles. many less experienced players don't think of them, but they are a good defensive tool. 
 
I thought about investigating slam, but decided since kia did not open, the chances of slam were not that good. But, it turns out slam is cold as long as I do not get a club lead.  |

^B@2Badmonster: I don't like my bid. I am tempted to make a stronger one. And terry's @H bid isn't exciting me. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: terry's bid makes your hand a bit worse, so 2@C is probably better than 3@C. If terry had bid 1@D or 1@S, your hand would be better. The value of your hand changes as the auction proceeds. So, you should re-evaluate your hand after each bid. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4C|AT|
hondo717: terry, why did you blast past 3N? If you can take 9 tricks, that is often easier than taking 11 tricks in a minor. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |

Pear: I was looking for a game in clubs  or small slam. And I wasn't comfortable in my hand in NT.|

^B@2hondo717: However, now that deb has made a slam try, you should love your hand. terry, what do you think deb 4@s bid is? |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|
Pear: I am assuming she has spades stopped. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, that is true, but she is also trying for slam. It normally should show first round control of spades. This bid, however, could be misleading. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: I play Italian cue bids. If I bid it at the five level it guarantees an ace. |

FP|Y|AT|
hondo717: You had the right idea deb, about the hearts, but you played the wrong person for the K of hearts. Your play only succeeds if I have both the K of diamonds and the K of hearts. A better play is to play kia for the K of hearts and  lead a heart to the ace, and lead the Q of hearts off dummy. If kia has the K, you can pitch  diamonds on  hearts. It is just that you have to take a "ruffing finesse" against kia. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now let us talk a little about cue bids. deb, can you explain Italian cue bids for us? Then I will explain how I play cue bids. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: Ok, regular old cue bids you bid all your aces first. Then you can show your kings. this takes up a lot of room. So, with Italian cues you bid your first or second round controls up the line. Then once you're sure there aren't two fast losers in any suit you can finish with RKC. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: So your 4@S bid promised either first or second round control. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: Right. So, I didn't mislead. I was misunderstood.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: What deb explained is how some people play cue bids. However, I prefer a slightly different method that deb alluded to. deb indeed did not mislead us. We just needed to agree on which method was in use. I play that the first time you cue bid a suit it promises first round control. So, if I was playing with a regular pard, I would have assumed 4@S showed the ace of spades or a void. Either method works. you just have to agree.

^B@2hondo717: It turns out a heart is the best lead kia. terry played it well, he can count on 5 clubs and 2 hearts for sure. If I have the ace of diamonds, he can count on 2 diamonds if I go up with my ace. And if I don't go up with my ace, he can count on a diamond and a spade. If kia has the ace of diamonds, there is still a chance the J of diamonds comes down in 2 rounds, and the 10 of diamonds is terry's ninth trick. So terry gave himself the maximum chances to make the hand. Good job! |

^-{              WHAT 1NT SHOWS AFTER A DOUBLE                }
^-|
CP||FP||at|
^C@e@2With no intervening bid or double, responder is required to bid with 6 points or more. The reason @E@3for this is that opener can have up to 20 points or so, and if responder passes with 6 or more points, game might be missed. However, once there is an intervening takeout double (or overcall for that matter), opener has another chance to bid even if responder passes. Therefore, responder is relieved of the responsibility of having to bid, even with 6 or more points, and should only do so if he has something important to add to the auction.

Up to a few years ago, responder's choices over an intervening takeout double were easy. Responder|cp|8|aT| redoubled|CP||AT| with 10 or more points. Any suit bid showed a 5+ card suit, and less than 10 points. A |cp|8|at|1N |cp||at|response was "constructive", showing 8-10 points and inviting a raise from opener if he had more than a minimum hand.

This basic structure still holds, up to a point. |cp|8|at|Jordan 2N |cp||at|bids were added, showing a limit raise or better in opener's suit. The biggest change was that most experts now play that a one level bid by responder is now forcing, and. although it can be done on as little as six points, it can also be done with 10 or more points (in other words, it shows the same thing, more or less, as if there were no intervening takeout double). 

Two level bids are not forcing, and still show less than 10 points (responder can still redouble). Responder is not obligated to make a one level bid with a weak hand of up to 8 points. He should only do so with a good suit (if only 4 cards, then it should include a high honor or two.) Remember that the takeout doubler is ostensibly showing good support for all unbid suits, especially majors, so responder should avoid bidding a weak 4 card suit if he also has a weak hand. 

We can now resume the play of the hand.|

^B@2hondo717: ok, now when I said you should lead 4th best, I should qualify that statement. It is rarely correct to lead a suit the opponents have bid. So you should lead your longest suit after eliminating the suits the opponents have bid. Here, clubs are probably not a good lead terry. |

hondo717: terry has a tough lead. however, on this auction it is likely we have clubs, since I didnt bid a major. Basically, to review, against NT, lead your best suit, eliminating suits the opponents have bid. In this case, with terry's hand, I would have led a spade. |

^B@2hondo717: Let us discuss the auction, starting with lisa's double. Recently, I talked about lead directing doubles. These occur after an artificial bid by the opponents, such as Stayman, a transfer, or a response to Blackwood. In those situations, if the next person doubles, then that is lead directing, asking partner to lead the suit bid. For example, had eileen opened 1N and I bid 2@C Stayman, then double by lisa would be lead directing, asking judy to lead clubs. However, my 2@C bid was natural, not artificial and  lead directing doubles do not apply. |

^B@2hondo717: eileen, I suggest you study inverted minor raises, as most people play them these days.

Regarding kia's question, playing inverted raises, clearly 2@D would be the best bid over 1@D. In the absence of inverted raises, I had 3 choices:
2 clubs showing 10+ and clubs, 3 spades which shows diamonds and a singleton spade and 2NT. I chose 2@C as what I thought was the best bid. I did not like bidding 2NT with a singleton spade. And I did not like bidding 3@S because it took up too much room. |

^B@2hondo717: Good playing. Now, let us discuss the auction. judy's first instinct was to bid 4@H because of her long hearts. But  you need to resist that temptation.  4@H does show long hearts, but it also shows less than a limit raise. You should not jump to 4@H with a good hand, otherwise you could easily miss slam. So, even with long hearts, you should bid Jacoby 2N or make a limit raise if you have enough points. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |

vybdt: With minimum points and 5 hearts would still bid 4@H using the law of total tricks. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, with 5+ hearts and even 0 points you should bid 4 hearts. |

^B@2hondo717: ok, lisa, what are you planning to bid over a 1N or 2@C rebid by your partner? With only 7 HCP, I am not sure you are strong enough to bid 2@H. Therefore, you should consider bidding 1@H rather than 1@S. That at least gives you some chance of finding a spade fit. |

^B@2hondo717: Nicely played. we are seeing some good declarer play tonight. And, indeed, lisa's 3@S bid was very good. Now, let me discuss how to respond with 4-4 and 5-5 in the majors. With 4-4 in the majors, if partner opens one of a minor, you always bid 1@H. With 5-5, it is a bit more complicated. If you have enough points to bid both hearts and spades, you should bid spades first, and then hearts twice. That way, you show your distribution, while keeping the bidding at a lower level. However, if you only have enought points for one bid, as with lisa on this hand, you should bid hearts first, even with 5-5. That gives you the most flexibility to find the major suit fit. If you bid spades first with 5-5 and a weak hand, you could easily lose the heart suit. |

^B@2hondo717: First, the bidding. Had I opened 1@S terry, you have either a very good constructive raise, or a weakish limit raise. I probably would consider your hand a bit weak for a limit raise, but a limit raise is not unreasonable. However, once kia opens 1@H, your hand gets worse, because the K of hearts is ill placed. Therefore, I think your initial bid of 3@S was fine. However, be aware that 3@S merely shows 4 card support, and can be done with as little as 6 points. Now, why I did change your original 3@S bid. |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: When I asked you what you thought 3@S showed, you said 8-11, which indicated to me that you thought it showed a limit raise. 3@S merely shows less than a limit raise, with 4 card support. It can be done with as few as 5 or 6 points. If the K of hearts was, say, the K of diamonds instead, so your hand is 10xxx xx, KJxxx Ax  I would consider that a limit raise, and tell you to bid 2@H. I think 2@S by you is not quite as good as 3@S, as 2@S tends to show 3 card support. terry 3@S shows 4 trumps, and probably some distribution, which is what you have on this hand  and it was a good bid, just wanted to make sure you knew what it meant exactly. |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, as far as the play goes, if you remember our discussion from last weak, I said I recommend leading low from 3 small in pard's suit if you have not supported. That approach works well on this hand, as deb's high low promised 2 hearts. kia now knows that a third heart will not give me a ruff and sluff. And, the 9 of hearts is suit preference asking for the higher non-trumps, in this case diamonds. |

If I have 10xx or 10xxx and choose to lead the suit, I tend to not like to lead the 10. The reason being that the 10 is high enough that my retaining it might be important. For example, on this hand, by leading the 10, terry set up deb's 9. |

^D @g@2"Up The Line"  refers to one very specific situation when pard opens one of a minor. If you have @E@34 hearts and 4 spades, you respond "up the line", meaning you bid hearts first. Several years ago, it also meant that if partner opened 1@C, and you had 4 diamonds and at least one 4 card major, you responded 1@D (again, bidding 4 card suits "up the line"). In modern bridge, many experts prefer what is known as "Walsh" when partner opens 1@C, bypassing even a long diamond suit to show a 4 card major. Similarly, as opener, if partner responds 1@D to your 1@C, "up the line" means that if you have both 4 hearts and 4 spades (e.g. your distribution is 4-4-2-3), you bid 1@H rather than 1@S. Therefore, "up the line" did not apply to the hand in question.

In general, as opener, your first obligation is to raise responder's suit if possible. Thus, on the hand in question, kia should raise 1@D to 2@D. Similarly, let us assume you are 4-4-2-3 and partner bids 1@H over your 1@C opener. You should bid 2@H rather than 1@S, even though you have 4 spades.

I have a few problems with  1N rebid over 1@D on the hand in question. First of all, as we already discussed, it denies diamond support. Also, the hand does not really have NT distribution, since it has 2 doubletons. And, finally, the stoppers in both of the unbid suits (Kx) are somewhat weak. Just because in this case we didn't get to 3N is not a justification for making an incorrect bid.  |

^B@2hondo717: Let us discuss kia's double first. He has enough points to do it. The only flaw is that he is tending to promise 4 hearts, but his hearts are good enough that I think it is a good bid anyway. As it turns out, he kept us from finding our heart fit, as I assumed he had 4 and was not willing to bid my hearts as a result.  terry has a problem over 2@D. He has an awfully good hand, and I could have some points, just nothing to bid over the double. However, he has no good bid over 2@D.  2@S is quite risky, as I did not support spades. A takeout double is out of question too. |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: As for me balancing with 2@H. That turns out to work out, but there are a couple of arguments against it. First, I have a stiff spade. and 2nd, kia will tend to have 4 hearts. So, it looks to me that the hand is somewhat of a misfit. If I were to choose to balance, 3@C would probably be better in general, although not on this hand. |

^B@2hondo717: It turns out if you pitch a heart instead of a diamond deb, you hold it to down 1. And since we have a diamond partial, down 1 would be ok. deb was not happy about her 2@S bid, and many experts would agree. I am a big fan of opening a weak 2 with any hand containing 5-10 HCP and a six card suit, because I think weak 2s are very effective bids. |
