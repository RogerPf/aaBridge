^d @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of the play, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: ok, pretty interesting hand. these distributional hands are hard to bid. The 3@S bid is clear. I bid 4@S because I had 3 spades, although because I also happen to have a good hand, I expect to make it.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: In general, if partner opens a 3 level preempt, you almost always should bid 4 with 3 card support, because you have a 10 card fit. And by my competitive theory of bidding to the level based on the number of trumps you have, a 10 card fit means you can bid to  the 4 level, which is a 10 trick contract. deb, with her void in spades, and long clubs, made a very reasonable call. Now, normally, kia should pass, because he has no idea what kind of hand I have. It could be strong, it could be weak, he doesn't know. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: However, with the void in clubs, I think 5@S is reasonable, but it could be wrong. It turns out we make with careful play, losing 1 diamond and one heart. On the other hand, although terry has 4 clubs and nothing else, his 6@C bid is ill considered, as he is not sure 5@S is making. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: I thought after 3@S bid you are the captain? |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: ira brings up a good point, which is why I need to clarify. I said, normally kia should not bid 5@S, for the very reason that I am the captain, and kia's hand is well known. It is very rare that kia should bid 5@S, but with his void in clubs and no defense outside of spades, and good spades, 5@S is reasonable on this hand  but pass would be ok too. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
gimit: If  nome passes, do you bid 5 spades? |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: no, if kia passes, I double 5 clubs. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Pear: I was thinking IF Deb could bid at level 5 after my pass she must have a powerhouse. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
nome: I too knowingly violated the well established rule of not to bid after a pre-empt because I could not ignore my unusual distributional hand.  |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Let me answer both. First, you don't know what she has terry, and because she knows we have a fit, she may be bidding on a long suit and short spades which is why you should pass. you probably have one more club than she is hoping for, but other than that, you have a much worse hand than she has a right to expect. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: And it was ok to violate the rule on this hand kia, but as I said, it is very rare that you have a hand that justifies a 5@S bid. After all said and done, these distributional hands are hard to judge. bidding them only comes with experience, and even then experts often get them wrong. |

^B@2Badmonster: Sorry. my head shut down and I lost focus. With my club singleton I should not have signed off based on the king of clubs being missing. I should have asked for the trump queen. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No 6@S was a good contract deb. And, terry made a very nice 4@H bid. Yes, deb is correct about Q ask. So over 4N terry shows 3 key cards, if deb bids 5@H, that asks terry if he has the Q of spades. If terry does not have the Q of spades, he simply bids 5 spades. If he does have the Q of spades, he bids the lowest suit in which he has a K, in this case, 6@D. He bids 5NT if Q and and no outside king. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2hondo717: Now, let us also talk about whether 5NT asks for specific King or number of Kings. you have to agree with your partner. In "pure" RKCB, it asks for cheapest specific King. However, many experts, including me, have decided that number of kings is better. You and your partner must decide which way to play it. If you play number of kings, even if you play 1430, 6@C = zero, 6@D = one, etc. |

^B@2hondo717: In general, it is a bad idea to lead opps suit, especially if the suit is in front of you. I will give you an undo so you can change your lead. If kia had bid hearts, there is a case for terry to lead hearts, but not if I bid them. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|
Pear: I only counted you for 4 hearts and not very good ones. That is why I lead a heart. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |

hondo717: Well, you were right on this hand, but not right in general. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: I disagree. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: OK, deb, lets hear your argument. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Badmonster: If he leads to the strength and I have anything he's doing your finessing for you. Better to lead through strength than to it, no? |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Not if you are the one with the strength behind the dummy. Last week, you quoted Mr. Bergen at me, so this week we will play "dueling experts", lol. Mike Lawrence says it is ok to lead a major declarer has bid, if you have 5 cards in it, and you suspect declarer only has 4.  I was surprised when I read that, because I had the same opinion as you, but I began to try it, and it often works out. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|
^B@2karseng: If I may interject (and I'm doing it anyway... lol) leading a heart from East here is very often incorrect as there is a high chance NS have 7 in total  which means you're actually helping declarer establish his long suit, and setting up a finesse on the 2nd trick. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: that is another good point karsent. Now it is time for the undo.|

^B@2hondo717: First, let us talk about opening leads vs NT. Generally, I find the old standby, 4th best from longest and strongest works well in the long run. However, if the opponents have bid the suit, I generally avoid leading it. As I mentioned, Mike Lawrence talks about a case where it is ok to lead the opponents suit, but if you always avoid leading the opps suit, you will be right most of the time. And since terry's best suit is hearts, he probably shouldn't lead it since I bid them. Here, the unbid major is a good lead, especially since it is clear kia does not have spades. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


AT|
Pear: Can I say why I lead it please. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Of course terry. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT|
Pear: Well .. Kia didn't open hearts so he can't have 5 ... he didn't support your hearts so he can't have 3 ... therefore we must be fairly strong in hearts.
hondo717: Yes, kia has no more than 2 hearts, that is true. he might bid 1N with 3 card heart support. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: in general, he has at least a doubleton, and I have at least 4, so, at best, you and deb have a 7 card fit. But if I have 5, and/or kia has 3, then we have more hearts than you. That is why a heart is not a good lead in general. It turns out on this hand, it is ok, but so is a spade. On average, if you avoid leading opponents suit on opening lead, you will do better. Once in a while, opps suit will turn out to be the spectacular lead, but more often it will work out badly. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Next, let us discuss terry's club duck. It was fine for terry to duck the club once. In fact, one could make a case that he should duck twice. The reason being, that if kia has an 8 card fit, deb has to discard on the 3rd club, and can signal terry what to lead. So, sometimes it is right to duck an ace until pard can signal you. |

^B@2hondo717: Interesting hand. kia basically have no good bid with his hand. The pass happened to work out very well, because I had such a good hand. He had 3 choices with the hand, none of them very good: |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|
^B@21) Pass, as he did, hoping that we have enough stuff to beat 1 diamond. Even if they make exactly one, they only score 140 (20 x 2 = 40 for the tricks, 50 for the part score, and 50 for making a doubled contract), which isn't too bad. However, for each overtrick they make, they get 200 points (because they are vul, if they were not vul it would be 100), so if they make more than 1 diamond, our score is not so good. So pass is a high risk/high reward bid, but certainly a reasonable choice. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT|
^B@22) 1NT. Normally this shows about 8 -10 points, so 1NT is definitely an overbid. It turns out if he bid 1NT, I bid 3, which makes.
3) 1@S. That is the best suit outside diamonds. We then also probably end up in 3NT.

BTW, I was intending to "double and correct" (to clubs) if he bid 1@S, showing a strong hand. That is why I doubled as opposed to bidding 2@C; double also gives us a chance to find a heart fit. |

From Spanish aficionar, which means "to inspire a liking for," this word is a relative of English affection.) @E@3anAficionado originally applied to devotees of bullfighting, but now applies to any type of ardent enthusiast.

"With the dwindling cigar market in mind, Marvin R. Shaken, the founder, editor, and publisher of Cigar Aficionado--a magazine for men who smoke cigars--has redesigned the monthly."--Alex Kuczynski, noting in The New York Times that the magazine's cover now features "Aficionado" in huge type and the once-prominent word "Cigar" in tiny letters.

^B@2hondo717: The bidding was pretty normal so not much to discuss. The main thing on the play was the spade suit. I did not capture the q of spades with the ace kia. Therefore, it is unlikely I have it. So, when I lead a low spade, you might as well play the 10, since you are almost certain terry has the ace and have to hope I have the J. I would not duck the ace as it would give away a trick. |

xxx_cpt: Question on Bergen Raises:  Can you still bid them as a passed hand? |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, you can play Bergen even by a passed hand unless you play drury. |

^B@2hondo717: kia, because you have a singleton and 5 hearts, you could bid 2@C, NMF to find out if deb has 3 hearts. If you find out that deb has 3 hearts, then 4 hearts is likely to be a better contract. although on this hand, 3N and 4H are both fine|

nome: oh good I did not know that I can do it with a singleton club.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: Sure, new minor forcing says nothing about clubs. it is completely artificial, just asking deb about her major suit holdings. |

^B@2hondo717: kia's 2@S is cue bid showing a limit raise in clubs. That is a very good convention to play after partner opens, if there is an overcall, a cue bid shows a limit raise or better. |

Badmonster: Isn't it a treatment, not a convention? |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I am not sure what the difference between a treatment and a convention is. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT|
Pear: I like them because they keep the bidding at a lower level usually. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I have been informed that a "treatment" is a natural bid with a specific meaning, such as an inverted minor raise. A convention is an artificial bid, such as a cue bid or Stayman. |

^B@2hondo717: Now I have a problem. I have a small inference since terry did not double 2@S, that terry does not have a 2 spade bid. So, the question is, how many do I go down in spades or diamonds, vs. can they make 5 clubs. I will pass, hoping I can cash either 2 spades and a diamond, or hope terry has a trick. |

^B@2hondo717: kia has a hard bid over 2@H. One possibility is 2@S, in case deb has 3 card support. most play that forcing. The other possibility, believe it or not, is 4@H.  deb's 2@H bid is fine. I personally play weak 2 with any 6 card suit, even with no honors, and 5-10 points. However, many require at least 2 of the top 4 honors. Most every expert would open deb's hand a weak 2. |

nome: Now that I spend more time on the four hands I see how badly I played the hand.  The 3NT makes hands down. |
