^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to <kiajaan@@san.rr.com>|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2hondo717: Now, once spencer got in with the heart, diamond was a reasonable play. However, he should lead the 8 or the 10. I prefer the 8, because the 10 implies the 9. Now, another lead you could have made spencer, which an expert might have done, is a low club. If moe, has the Q, then you are making aggie guess, and in this particular case, because dummy has Kx, it will never cost you a trick. That is a fairly common position on defense, where the K is on the board, and you have the A. If you have no better lead, leading away from the ace in that case is often very ...effective.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|
^B@2xxx_cpt: I thought you would "slap my hand" - leading low from an unsupported A.
hondo717: On opening lead spencer and in trump contract, you should never lead away from an ace. But, once you see how the defense has proceeded, it is clear that clubs and diamonds are the key suits, so if you want to be aggressive, leading away from the ace can be an ... effective play. Again, it is true, if you never lead away from an ace in a suit contract, you will seldom be wrong. I was just bringing it up as a tricky defensive maneuver in some very special situations. |

^B@2hondo717: As far as the rest, we should not be in game even though we made 4. It is on 2 finesses, which is 25%. You should not bid 25% games. spencer opening lead was fine, even though it didn't work out. He shouldn't lead diamonds since I bid them. And he shouldn't lead clubs, since he would have to lead the ace. So a spade was a good lead. Ace or trump was another possibility, but really no reason to lead trump. |

^B@2hondo717: I have a problem here, as follows.  aggie should have a few points, since they stopped at 2 spades. However, she didn't' t bid 3 diamonds, so it is unlikely she has 3 card support. On the other hand, I know they have an 8 card fit, and it is usually not good policy to let them play at the 2 level, once they have found a fit and I likely can take 7 tricks with my hand, even with no help from aggie. On the other hand, I am vul, and I might push them into game. so I will reluctantly pass. |

^B@2hondo717: well, first of all it turned out my analysis was correct. If I bid 3@D, we are down 2 if they let me play it there. And since they make 3 spades, pushing them to 3 spades accomplishes nothing.

^B@2hondo717: Now let me discuss the pros and cons of playing 1N forcing by a passed hand.  I play 1N forcing even by a passed hand, although many 2 over 1 players do not. I would say about half do play it forcing and half do not. The reason I like to play it forcing is illustrated by this hand. I have a limit raise with 3 trumps therefore, I cannot make a limit raise, and 2S is too weak. So, I can still bid a forcing NT, and bid 3@S over aggie's bid. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|
^B@2If you play drury, in which 2@C by a passed hand shows a spade raise, then that problem goes away, so there is less reason to play 1N forcing by a passed hand. I do not like drury myself, and if you do not play it, I think you have to play 1N as forcing by a passed hand. And even if you play drury, there are some hands where you have a weak hand and a six card suit and would like to play in that suit. So, if you play 1N forcing, you can still get to play in your suit. My recommendation is to play forcing NT and not Drury. |

^B@2hondo717: First the bidding. Should moe pass with his hand? That is more a matter of style. I advocate opening weak 2s with any six card suit, and 5-10 points.  However, I would say more people than not would pass with moe's hand. So, pass is certainly a majority opinion, just one I don't happen to share. As many of those watching know, I open weak 2s a lot, even with an outside 4 card major. And yes, no honors are necessary. But again, if that makes you uncomfortable, don't do it. moe was just doing what I like to do, but I certainly understand if you are not comfortable playing that. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: I like aggie's 3@D bid. With a six card suit and opening points, you should usually overcall over a weak 2. The only bad thing about her hand is the KQ of spades. Although they are likely to be taking tricks on defense, they are not likely to fit well with my hand. However, I would overlook that problem and bid 3@D as aggie did. Now what about spencer? Let me ask you this. What would you bid if aggie passed and what should moe respond with his hand? |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT|
xxx_cpt: 2NT asking for feature and moe would bid 3@S. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, back to the auction. There are a couple of problems with your hand spencer, even if moe has a max. The singleton spade is a big minus. You only have a seven card fit, so even if moe has 10 HCP, it is quite likely you will go down. With a club card and 10 HCP, you might make 3NT, but that is it. On balance, I think pass will work out best even if aggie passes. And, once aggie bids, there are fewer high card points available to moe, so that is another reason to pass. On close hands, trump length is a very good guide. So if you don't have good trump length, pass is usually good. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, let me discuss an alternative to 2NT asking for feature, known as Ogust. There is another way to play a 2N response to a weak 2, known as Ogust. It allows the weak 2 opener to describe both his suit quality and high card points. The opener has a "good" suit if his suit contains two of the top three honors (e.g. AK, AQ, or KQ.) And the opener has a "good" hand if he is at the upper end of his range, 8-10 HCP. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|
^b@2hondo717: So, if responder bids 2N, opener can describe whether or not he has both a good hand and a good suit. With a bad hand and a bad suit, he makes the cheapest bid, 3@C. It says nothing about clubs, only that opener has a bad hand and bad suit. All Ogust responses are completely artificial. Conversely, with a good hand and a good suit, opener makes the max bid, 3@S. A 3@D response shows a bad hand (5-7) and good suit and 3@H shows a good hand (8-10) and bad suit. I like that system better, because responder is now usually able to accurately place the final contract. But, many people do play feature. |

^B@2hondo717: First the auction. lou, you are a bit weak for a negative double, you do have 5 points, but 3 of them are in hearts, which is dianne's suit. That is likely not to fit with partner, although it happened to work in this case. However, had dianne passed, I would say, because you are 4-4 in the majors, you barely have enough to bid 1@H, so the negative double was not  egregious by any means. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: And the defense was fine. once the J of diamonds wins, and the spade wins,  I can count 8 tricks for barb. On this hand, counting out declarer's winners was not important, but it is a good habit to get into. Once dianne signaled clubs, I new we had 5 likely tricks, 4 clubs, and either a heart or spade. So the signal helped me defend. had they been in 3N it would have been crucial. |

hondo717: Well, you are worried about hearts. however, you are more than on the top of your bid. You have a good 5 card suit and a good 4 card suit, both potential source of tricks. In imps, it is very important to bid close games. so 3N would have been a better bid.  |

^B@2hondo717: With two touching honors as defender, you play the lowest card you can as third hand. So you should play the J, it gives partner more information. If you play the Q it denies the J. |

 ^B@2hondo717: We went over the important points already.  dianne should bid 3N. You are better off in bridge if you are an optimist, particularly when bidding games. Don"t think about what can go wrong, think about what can go right. The odds favor you bidding a 35% vulnerable game, and a 40% non-vul game. You cannot always work out the odds, but you do know that you should stretch with any excuse.  The other point was 3rd hand defensive play with touching honors. When you have an honor sequence as 3rd hand, you play the lowest in the sequence, so J from QJ in this case. With QJ10, the 10, etc. The reason for this is that it gives partner the most information. |

^B@2hondo717: Interesting bidding problem for barb. Actually, by the rule of 20 you do have an opener, 11 HCP, 6 @Cs + 3 @Ds = 9, for a total of 20. I would personally open that hand, but it is right on the margin. I particularly like the club suit. My rule in 2 over 1 is, if you are not sure whether or not to bid 2 over 1, then you can bid it if you have a hand which meets the rule of 20. So I would have bid 2 clubs with your hand. But the reason I asked you the question is that, if you would not open the hand, then you do not have enough to bid 2 over 1. Having said all that, it turns out if you bid 2 clubs, we probably end up in either 3N or 5@C, neither of which makes. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: so your approach worked out better on this hand. but I still think over the long run, you would be better off bidding 2@C. Yes, as the auction proceeds, you would be worried about spades, but we will find out, because the auction would go 1@H-2@C-2@D-3@C. I might then bid 3@S, asking you to bid 3N with spade values (if I had spade values I would bid 3N), and you would bid 4@C which  I might pass, because now it looks like my Q of spades is worthless. |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|
Campus61: If you bid 3NT why would I bid 4@c? |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: I wouldn't bid 3N over 3C, I would bid 3@S. The auction would go 1@H-2@C-2@D-3@C-3@S. My 3@S bid asks you to bid 3N with some spade values. If I had spade values I would bid 3N. |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


AT|
Campus61: Then I would bid 3nt after your 3@S? |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No, you should not bid 3N, because you do not have spade values. In this particular sequence my 3@S is asking, not telling. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


AT|
EternalUke: Would that bid be a target for lead directing double?
hondo717: Yes, if I bid 3@S, a lead directing double would be possible if West had the appropriate hand. |
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hindo717: Finally, back to the question about what barb should play on trick one. It probably doesn't matter, but I would play low, since the Q will never win the trick. In general, 2nd hand low, particularly from dummy. Further, lou would never lead low from AK, so might as well play low. Remember, the defenders cannot see your hand, and they will sometimes make a mistake. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT|
Pear: In the 1@H-2@C-2@D-3@C-3@S  sequence ... in 2/1 the 2@C bid would be wrong.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Now, to answer terry's question, barb would bid 2@C if she decided she wanted to force to game, and since she has a rule of 20 hand, it is reasonable that she wants to force to game. |

^B@2hondo717: The bidding bears some comment. Everything is fine through 2@C. However, lou, you have an opening hand, so you need to make a forcing bid. 2@D can be passed. Probably a better bid by you would be 2@H rather than 2@D. That would ask dianne to bid NT with a heart stopper which she would, and then you would get to 3N for sure. The way you bid it, dianne might pass.  Let us do the next board.|

^B@2hondo717: Nicely played. It turns out 5@D is the best contract. 3N goes down on a club lead. However, I think lou's 3@H bid was very good. I have a decision to make. and since 9 tricks is usually easier than 11 tricks, I chose to bid 3N. We cannot make 6 diamonds if barb is on lead. And we can make 6N if dianne leads a club. Now, granted, dianne might very well not lead a club at 6N, but it is still a bit lucky. We only have 23 HCP, so I don't feel too bad about missing slam. In the next panel I recap Inverted raises. Please click the forward arrow. |

^-{      HOW HOWARD PLAYS INVERTED RAISES     }
^-|
CP||FP||at|
^D@21) If I make a minor raise (to either the 2 level or 3 level), I am guaranteed to have no 4 card major.  @E@3 

2) I make a jump raise (to the 3 level) with 5 to a bad 9 points and 5+ card suit. I might have the other minor, but feel that the jump raise is tactically the right thing to do to make it difficult for the opponents. I will tend to prefer the jump raise to a bid of 1N if I have 5 card support.

3) I make a limit raise with 10+ points and usually 5 card support. (The only time I will have 4 card support is if I am 4-4 in the minors and partner opens 1D.) If partner opens clubs, I will not have 4 diamonds. If partner opens diamonds, I will not have 5+ clubs (in sayc; in 2 over 1,  1@D/2@C is slightly more complicated). Opener should now respond with his lowest stopper. If responder has less than a game forcing hand, he should continue to bid stoppers below 3 of the agreed upon suit, or 2N if he has all the other suits stopped. If responder has a game forcing hand, he must make sure the partnership bids game, by either bidding 3N if all suits are stopped, or continue bidding new suits if not. Similarly, if opener has 15+, it is his responsibility to make sure the partnership reaches games, by either bidding 3N if all suits are stopped, or continuing to bid new suits if not. Once 3 suits have been bid (the original suit and 2 stopper suits), if someone bids the 4th suit, that is asking about a stopper rather than telling, because if the bidder has the remaining suit stopped, he can bid NT himself.

4) Inverted minors are off in competition (including over takeout doubles), in the sense that a raise to 2 is less than a limit raise. A raise to 3 is still preemptive. With a limit raise or better, responder cue bids over an overcall, and bids Jordan 2N (if the partnership is playing it) or redoubles (if the partnership is not playing Jordan) over a takeout double. |

^B@2hondo717: Just a few points. Let me  discuss 3rd seat light openers again.  Recently, we reviewed it in another mentoring session of mine. This is my philosophy, not universally agreed upon.  20 years ago, experts played sound openers in 1st and 2nd seat, 13 or more HCP. Therefore, they had to open light in 3rd and 4th seat, because otherwise they might miss game on occasion. However, if you use rule of 20 openers, you often open light in first and second seat and there is no reason anymore that you have to open light in 3rd and 4th seat. The disadvantage of opening light is that your opening bid range in 3rd and 4th seat is very wide, and so it is hard for the partnership to figure out how high to go. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: So I would not have opened with dianne's hand, although it worked out ok here. Some people do use the "rule of 15", especially in 4th seat. The rule of 15 says you have an opener if your HCP plus spades equals 15. The reason for that rule is if you have spades, you can compete effectively. But that rule still has the problem of 3rd and 4th seat openers ranges being very wide if you can open light, so I don't personally use the rule of 15. It is up to you as to whether or not to open light, just not my style. dianne's hand qualifies on that account and 2.5 Quick Tricks which is another criteria used by some people. |

^B@2hondo717: So you had a good plan aggie. You should have stuck to it. Now, let us talk about how moe could have counted out aggie's hand. granted, it would take some work. aggie drew 2 rounds of trump, and stopped, which means she probably had 9 between the 2 hands, given aggie 5 spades. She played 3 rounds of clubs, and was out on the third round, so she had 2 clubs.  She then played 3 rounds of hearts. Since moe started with 5, had he been able to count hearts, he would have realized that aggie had no more hearts, giving her 3 to start with. Then, her original distribution was 5-3-3-2. |
