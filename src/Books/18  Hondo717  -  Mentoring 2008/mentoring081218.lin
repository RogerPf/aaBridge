^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the auction first. Everything through 3 hearts is fine. However, elizabeth should now bid 3N, since she has the black suits stopped. It is rarely right to play in 5 of a minor rather than 3N.  On this hand, 3N is cold. 5@D is 75%, because it makes unless terry has both spade honors, but 3N is cold. It is unlikely I would bid 3@H with nothing in hearts.|

hondo717: |CP||AT|If responder bids 2N instead of 2@D, the wrong hand becomes declarer. But, you want the strong hand to be declarer where  more of the high cards are hidden, making it harder to defend and often you do not want the opening lead through the strong hand. Therefore, over 2@C, you should almost always bid 2@D as the auction on the left, unless you have a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. One comment on the play. In general, you should avoid leading the opponents suits on opening lead (except sometimes trumps are a good lead.) So best opening lead is a club as we avoided 3N and bid the other 3 suits. A heart lead could easily give up a trick. For example, suppose south had the J of hearts instead of terry.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think both the auction and play were fine, but I will just make a few clarifications.  elizabeth's bid was DONT, showing diamonds and a major.  I think she is a bit weak to do it vulnerable, but since all her points are in her 2 suits, and she has a singleton, there is some merit to her bid. My responsiblity as responder to DONT is to pass with 3+ card diamond support, otherwise to bid the next higher suit at two level --2@H here, which allows partner to pass if she has hearts or bid spades if she has spades. In this case I had 3 diamonds, so I passed. Then, I think it is reasonable for terry to show his 5 card spade suit. It turns out 2@S is down, but on average roberta will have a better hand, and it will make or go down 1  and we probably make 2@D anyway, so no big loss.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, that was a good slam, and can be made if planned better. But, first let us discuss the auction which was very good. The 2@D bid  was 4th suit forcing. That says "partner, I want to establish a game forcing auction, and keep the bidding lower." The next bids 3@H, is saying, "partner I am interested in a heart slam."  Npw, even though I only ostensbily have 11 HCP, I have a really good hand. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have two really good suits, and 2 singletons. I am also very interested in slam. So, my next bid is a control bid showing first or 2nd round control in clubs. Normally, you don't skip any suits in which you have controls. With my hand, I could bid 3@S, since I do have 2nd round control of spades. However, I decided that my singleton might not be of interest to roberta since she bid spades. Thus, I decided to just show my club control, and skip my spade control. Once roberta sees I have a club control, since she controls both diamonds and spades, it is just now a matter of how many key cards we have.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So blackwood is fine, and since we are missing only one key card, six hearts is the correct contract. This is the sort of auction we will be discussing in great detail in my upcoming lessons on slam bidding.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


AT|
pottsca: Wouldn't it be nice to ask for the queen? It is free.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Yes, that is a good point. roberta should actually ask about the Q of hearts, by bidding 5@D over my 5@C. Since I do have the Q of hearts, I respond 6@C, which is the cheapest King that I have. Further, roberta need not bid 4@D because she knows we have control of all the suits, so RKCB is her correct bid.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And regarding the "specific kings" question, if roberta asks about the Q of hearts by bidding 5@D over 5@C, responses are as follows:
- if I do not have the Q of hearts, I bid 5@H;
- if I do have the Q of hearts, I bid the lowest suit in which I have a king, in this case clubs
- if I have the Q of hearts but no outside kings, I bid 5N (some people play I bid 6@H.)

Now, let me focus on the play of the hand.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Slam is a very good contract. roberta can count 11 top tricks, 5 hearts, 2 diamonds, 3 spades and 1 club and she needs to develop a 12th trick. There are a couple of possibilities. One is, if terry has the ace of clubs, she has 2 club tricks. The other is, if spades are 4-3, she can make her 5th spade good. She can also ruff a club high, if clubs are 3-2. But if clubs are 4-1, she can go down. In any case, at trick 2 she has to do one of the following:
- she either has to play ace of spades and ruff a spade, and then draw trumps ending in dummy or,
- she has to draw trumps ending in dummy, and then play a club, keeping the ace of spades as a 2nd entry.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, since she decided to draw trumps first, she then has to play a club before playing spades. It turns out either play works, clubs or spades, and she has to pick one. Again it comes down to counting your winners and losers before playing out the hand. |cs|4|at|^-

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She played the hand well, except she forgot she set up the spade. The way she played it, she should take 5 diamonds, 2 clubs, and a spade for 8 tricks. And if they don't take their 2 heart tricks right away, and she guesses clubs, she can even make 9 tricks. However, I would have played clubs the same way she did, since east has most of the points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another interesting bidding hand. Let me discuss it before we start the play. The first two bids are pretty standard. As to roberta's one spade bid, one level overcalls only require 8 points or so. Some people prefer you have a better suit, as partner will be leading it. However, the modern tendency is to lay claim to the spade suit if you have it, so roberta's bid has some merit. And, about my 4@C bid. Once partner bids 1@H, I know we should be in at least 4 hearts. And it turns out, you can splinter as opener, if you have a game forcing hand, support for partner, and a singleton.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you didn't play splinters, I would simply bid 4@H. But, since we are playing splinters, I might as well provide the extra information and bid 4@C on the way to 4@H. Now, how should terry evaluate his hand?

First of all, other than the ace, any other honor in clubs is a minus. So terry basically has a six point hand, since the K of clubs might as well be the deuce. Therefore, he has no interest in slam. However, if his K of clubs was somewhere else, say the K of diamonds or Q of hearts, then he might be more interested.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if he had one of those cards, it turns out slam is on a finesse. So we probably should still not be in slam. In order to be interested in slam, I would say he should have at least 10 points or so outside of clubs and a fifth heart is also very valuable. Now, let us play this hand.|

In general, if partner opens 1 of a major and you have 4 card support, it is best to show it right away. In fact, Marty Bergen says if you don't show 4 card support immediately, partner should assume if you show support later, it shows only 3 card support. The modern tendency is to always show 4 card support. since, with Bergen Raises, you can describe your strength very accurately. Now, let us play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|ira's duck of the club is often correct  because it prevents ally from leading it again. However, in this case, he does not want a diamond shift. It turns out if he does that, then he makes 5, because he can pitch 2 diamonds on spades. Therefore,  although ira's duck is often right, he has to think about it in the context of the entire hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the auction while it is fresh. Although pam does not have an opening hand, double is very good with her hand, as she has good distribution, and she is a passed hand. She has exactly the hand I would expect. ally's only real bid is redouble. Over pam's double, if ally had a limit raise or better in spades, she would bid 2N --Jorden 2NT. Almost all experts play Jorden 2NT to promise at least 4-card support. Therefore, her redouble denies 4 spades. |

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, why did I bid 3@C.  pam should have at least 3 clubs for her takeout double, so I know we have a 9+ card fit. I am therefore willing to compete to 3@C, so might as well take up as much room as possible. My 3@c bid gave Ira a problem. On the one hand, he has a min opening hand. On the other hand, he does have six spades. I probably would have chosen a pass. If Ira had a singleton club, then I would have chosen 3@S. But 3@S is certainly a reasonable choice. I purposely bid 3@C to give Ira a problem. However, ally indicated to me that she would have bid 4@S had Ira passed. With her hand that shows very good bridge logic.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of the kibs insisted that Ira should have bid 4@S after my 3@c. I explained that redouble shows 10+ points, and denies 4 card spade support, For all Ira knows ally can have anywhere from 0-3 spades. Again note that I am using the teaching table. Only I and the kibs can see the four hands. The other three players do not see the other hand. Therefore, Ira had no reason to know that ally has 3-card support. Okay, now let us play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok, again a bidding problem. Over 1@H, ally has a problem. She has better than a minimum opener. Playing strong NT, her only choice is 3@D. However, because she is playing the weak NT, she has another choice. The auction 1D-1H-1N by ally shows a strong 1N opener. Now, granted, because of her 6 card suit, she doesn't really have as strong 1N opener and, technically, she shouldn't bid 1N.  On the other hand, 1N does have the advantage of keeping the bidding lower, and still getting her point count across. So, I might choose to lie and bid 1N. But 3@D is technically the correct bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|ira has hard choices to make. 3N is a reasonable choice. He does have 5 hearts, but they are not that good, and he has scattered values in the other suits, and possibly lots of club tricks. So, even though he is unbalanced, 3N is a good shot. After all said and done  ira has no clear cut choice which is why 1N by ally might have worked out better on this hand. ira was clearly hoping ally has spades when he bids 3N.  3@H is ira's other choice, in which case ally bids 3N. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


nt||at|{|ia|pp1dp1hp2cp2dp2nppp|at|}|HT|c|cp|8|AT|^M@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, if ally had bid 1N, then ira could bid 2C, checkback @E@3stayman, and then bid 2N when ally denies any majors, or even bid 2@H to play. A possible weak NT auction is what you see on the left hand side.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his important @E@3instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls"  which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you can find many more.

|FP|2|cp|8|at|
^C@2** |FP||cp||at|It is rarely right to play in 5 of a minor rather than 3N.
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|Over 2@C, you should almost always bid 2@D, unless you have a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors.
|FP|2|cp|8|at| 
** |FP||cp||at|In general, you should avoid leading the opponents suits on opening lead (except sometimes trumps are a good lead.)
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|Always count your winners and losers before playing out the hand.  
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|Redouble shows 10+ points, and denies 4 card  support. 
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|In general, if partner opens 1 of a major and you have 4 card support, it is best to show it right away.
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|If you play Bergen Raises;
-- a simple raise to 2 is done with exactly 3 card support. If you have 4 card support, depending on your point count you must choose between 
-- jumping to 3 of the major, 
-- 3@D 7-10 points
-- 3@C 10-12 points or (3@D and 3@C are Reverse Bergen for the point ranges)
-- 2N and Splinter 12+ points. 
The only question is, how weak can the jump to 3 of a major be? I teach that it is 5-6, and opener is allowed to bid game with 18+.

^C @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
