NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Good auction for discussing competition over 1N. terry's bid was DONT, showing clubs and another suit. We will discuss in a minute whether terry was strong enough or not. But let us discuss the mechanics first. Had I passed, kia is supposed to pass with 3+ clubs, otherwise bid 2 diamonds, to allow terry to pass with diamonds or bid his other suit if not diamonds. Now, as to whether terry is strong enough. As far as distribution, I think 5/4 or even 4/4 is ok to bid DONT with. However, I think the less distribution you have, the more points you need.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|In general my guidelines are with 5/5 you can bid DONT with as little as 8 points or so in your 2 suits. If terry had been 5/5 in the minors, and his J of spades had been a minor suit J, I would not quarrel with his bid. However, I do feel terry is a bit weak for DONT myself. One more point. One could make a case that kia could bid 3@D once I pass 2@S. He can assume that terry's other suit must be either diamonds or hearts. And since he has 4 card support for both, 3@D should work out ok.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT| 
hondo717: |CP||AT|Now, what can the responder to 1N do after interference?  There are basically 2 popular methods. One method, which is quite complicated, is known as Lebensohl. I do not recommend most people play that, as it is quite complicated.  And the other method I will discuss, works pretty well most of the time. However, if you want to learn about lebensohl, there is a write up on my web site at, ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N. Go to my weak NT lessons, and download part 3.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|The method I recommend for dealing with NT interference is "systems on, stolen bid doubles" which  means that any bid I make is the same as if Terry had not interfered. So, 2@D and 2@H here are still transfers. The other part of this is "stolen bid" double. That means if I doubled terry, that says "that is the bid I intended to make" (e.g. Terry "stole" my bid.) In this case, if I doubled 2@C, that says I intended to bid 2@C, which is Stayman but my bid was stolen.|

UP|52|PF|Y|NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Now, let us review the auction first.  The question is, should kia bid 2@H or pass. There are plusses and minuses. The plusses are, kia has a good hand, and it is better to get into the auction earlier rather than later. The minuses are, he has spades and a bad heart suit. This hand could very well be a misfit. So, I would probably pass with kia's hand, but I do not quarrel with 2@H.  As to aggie's 2@S bid. I think it is fine. She is a point shy, and 4-3-3-3, but she has several tens and nines. If she had a 5 point hand with spade shortness, she should definitely pass, whether or not kia made a bid.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|2@S was fine and I have a clear 4 spade bid. With better breaks, it makes. Now, should kia double. He can see 3 tricks for sure, a diamond and 2 spades. And it is more likely that I have the ace of spades than aggie. Thus, double is reasonably safe especially since we are vulnerable. It is unlikely we are making, although the double might cause me to play the hand a trick better in some cases. If we are only down 1, the extra 100 points is not that big a deal. However, if we are down 2, then -500 is way better than -200. In this particular case, I think the rewards of doubling outweigh the risk.|

PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT| 
hondo717: |CP||AT|OK, a bit of a discussion here. First, moe's limit raise. Typically, a limit raise should show 4 card support. So, assuming they are playing sayc, moe should bid 2@C, followed by 3@S over terry's rebid. If playing 2 over 1,  then moe bids a forcing 1N, followed by 3@S. In either case, those auctions show an invitational hand with 3 card spade support. It turns out the extra spade is very important when bidding close games. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|When deciding whether or not to bid a close game, you should tend to bid it with a nine card fit, not bid it with an eight card fit. The extra trump is worth about 3/4 of a trick on average, believe it or not. Now, let us again look at moe's hand. I think he actually has a strong raise. My general rule is, if partner opens, and I have a hand that meets the rule of 20, then I want to force to game. So, I would bid 2@C with his hand, followed by 4 spades. His  3 spades bid is too weak with his hand, putting aside the fact that he only has 3 trumps.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Now, let me discuss terry's method of playing the spades. Given the auction, I think terry is correct in playing me for the queen of spades.  aggie made a takeout double, presumably showing spade shortness. Therefore,  terry's play makes sense due to the auction. The general rule with nine card fits missing the Q is as follows:
** if neither of the opponents bid, then I just play for a 2/2 break;
** if one of the opponents showed a long suit, I play the other opponent for the queen. 
In this case, aggie showed long other suits, so it is reasonable for terry to play me for the Q.|

PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|  
hondo717: |CP||AT|Some interesting aspects to this auction. First of all, aggie's 2 diamond bid. Normally, a new suit by responder is forcing. However, over a takeout double, that is not always true. One reason is because you can redouble with 10 points or more. Thus, some people play any suit bid by responder over a takeout double shows less than 10 points and is not forcing. However, the more modern way to play it is that one level suit bids by responder are still forcing but two level bids are not. Here, aggie's 2@D bid should deny 10 points.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Had she bid 1@D, 1@H, or 1@S, that would be forcing. My pass is also an important concept. If you suspect a misfit, you should pass. do not try and rescue partner. In this case, we have a club fit, but I don't know that. With aggie's hand I would have bid 1@D (forcing) not 2@D. But once she chooses to bid 2@D, as far as I am concerned, she is showing a weak 2 in diamonds  and I need to pass, because it looks like a misfit to me.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Double and 2@s by moe is "double and correct." He is showing 5+ spades, and 16 points or so.  terry almost has a raise to 3 spades. If his 5 points had been a K and a Q, instead of just queens and jacks, he should consider it. But I think given that his points are all in queens and jacks, and he only has 5 points, pass is fine.|

NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT| 
hondo717: |CP||AT|First the opener. The question is, with 6/5 in the majors, should anna open a weak 2. Many experts would not  but I would. I think any time you have 5-10 points and a six card suit (assuming you don't meet the rule of 20), you should open a weak two. You are basically betting that you will come out ahead more often by preempting rather than worrying about missing a fit. I personally think that is a good bet and vulnerability doesn't change my bids for the most part. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|I believe in opening a weak 2, even with an outside 4 card major. Almost all the time, playing in the six card suit works out as least as well as playing in the 4 card major, even  if partner has a fit for you.But many experts will disagree with me. depends on your style. additionally, one could make a case that gale could bid 4@S using my competitive bidding rules, 4@S is ok with a 10 card fit. |

hondo717: |CP||AT|We went over the important bidding principles here, but I will review them. In modern bidding, there are many different kinds of raises available, depending on how many trumps you have, and how many points. It is important that you pick the correct one in every auction. In a competitive auction, where partner bids a suit and the next person overcalls, the cue bid as limit raise or better is an excellent bid. Therefore, if you raise without making a cue bid, that denies a limit raise. It is very important that you cue bid when you have a limit raise, otherwise partner will miss game sometimes.|

NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|The other important point is, once you describe your hand, you can pass if you have no further information to give to partner. On this particular hand, once gale bids 3@D, anna knows everything about gale's hand, gale has 10-12 pts and 4 spades. BTW, I play a cue bid promises 4 trumps, although some people will do it with 3.  The reason I like it to show 4 card support is that a nine card fit is worth about half a trick more than an eight card fit with the same number of points, so partner can bid close games if they know you have a nine card fit. Usually, if partner has a good 14, they should bid game, otherwise not.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|anna played this brilliantly, unfortunately her partner did no bid this so brilliantly. This is quite an interesting hand, actually. The bidding was fine up to 3@D at least.  anna's bidding illustrates an important principle. Once you limit your hand with your first bid, it is much easier to bid more freely, because it is hard to over bid. In this particular case, anna passed originally, denying six points. her pass was correct, particularly with a singleton club.   Therefore, once I bid 2@D, showing a strong hand with longer clubs than diamonds, anna can easily bid 3@D, because I know she doesn't have six points.  |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Next, I decided with my hand, since I only had 4 diamonds and anna had less than six points, that the chances of making 5@D were not that good, so I chose to pass. However, 5@D turns out to be a good contract. Obviously, since I can see all 4 hands, I could bid 5@D, but at a real table I think I would pass, so that is why I did so. Looking at the hand again, I think I was a bit conservative, but I figured it was likely we lose 1 club, 1 heart, and 1 diamond. The important principle here is once anna passed the 1@C bid, she could bid 3@D with great confidence.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ACTIII: Did you consider opening 2 clubs?|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Good question.  I have a 4 loser hand, so 2@C is a possible opener. However, I do not like to open 2@C when my suit is a minor suit, because we are at the 3 level right away. Therefore, unless I have a real solid 2@C opener with a minor suit, I tend to open 1 of the minor. One of the worst auctions, for example, is 2@C-2@D-3@D. You are already at the 3 level, and you have essentially only made one bid. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now let me briefly discuss odd/even discards, even though they did not come up on this hand. Basically, odd/even discards are a defensive signaling system. The first time a defender discards, that is does not follow suit, is when they apply. If the defender discards an odd card, it means the defender likes that suit, and is showing some cards in that suit. If the defender discards an even card, it means he/she does not like that suit. Some people also play an even card is suit preference for the other two suits, but I don't like that. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|More often than not, you don't want to encourage in any suit, but if you play an even card is suit preference, you have to encourage some suit. So, if you play odd/even, I suggest you keep it simple -- odd encourages, even discourages. Remember, it is only the first discard-- the first time a defender does not follow suit.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, responses to 2@C.  As most of you know, the modern tendency is to play 2@D waiting. My 2@D bid doesn't mean much. It is almost forced. If I have a good 5 card suit, with two of the top three honors, I can bid that suit instead of 2@D. Otherwise, I must bid 2@D over 2@C. Then, 2@H, 2@S, 3@C, or 3@D bids show good 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Probably the most common method of showing a negative hand by responder is a 2@H artificial response over 2@C. A bid of 2@H over 2@C, shows a hand with no aces or kings. In fact, on the hand I had, I could bid 2@H if I wanted over 2@C. If we played that system, then moe would know that he should stop at 4@H  since I denied any aces or kings. The reason you concentrate on aces and kings, is because they are usually much more important to the 2@C bidder than Qs and Js. If you play 2@H is negative over 2@C, then a 2N bid by responder shows a heart suit.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|Some people don't like to play 2@H showing a negative hand.  They play what is known as "2nd negative."  In this treatment with a bad hand responder  first bids 2@D and then he bids the cheapest minor over a non-NT rebid by the 2@C opener. For example, the auction 2@C-2@D-2@H-3@C, shows responder has a bad hand. It says nothing about clubs  3@C is the cheapest minor in that case. Similarly, 2@C-2@D-3@C-3@D shows a bad hand (again, cheapest minor.) Personally, I prefer the 2@H negative to the cheapest minor "2nd negative." |

hondo717: |cp||at|There is an interesting play that aggie could make here. My bid show that I have seven Diamonds. There are three in the dummy and moe played six. So there are only 8 and 4 are out. If aggie plays the four then I know moe started with a singleton since he would play high/low with a doubleton. Eight followed by six and I am assured of giving him a ruff. On the other hand, I cannot see the four if aggie plays the eight and I would think that moe have started with a doubleton.  An expert declarer would always pitch the 8 from aggie's hand whether they have 84 or stiff 8, to avoid letting me know whether or not moe has a doubleton.  |

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at|

**  When deciding whether or not to bid a close game, you should tend to bid it with a nine card fit, not bid it with an eight card fit. The extra trump is worth about 3/4 of a trick on average, believe it or not.

**  My general rule is, if partner opens, and I have a hand that meets the rule of 20, then I want to force to game.

**  If you suspect a misfit, you should pass. do not try and rescue partner.

**  Any time you have 5-10 points and a six card suit (assuming you don't meet the rule of 20), you should open a weak two.

**  Inverted minors do not apply once there is interference.

^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
