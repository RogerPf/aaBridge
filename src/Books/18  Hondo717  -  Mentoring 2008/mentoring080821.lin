^*Bhondo717:^*N First the bidding.  1@H-2@D-P was fine.  I don't think pam has enough points to bid 2@S, however. I play that shows at least 10 points and at least 5 spades, and is forcing. Some people play that new suits by responder to overcall is not forcing, but I don't agree. How can responder force overcaller to take another call?  The fact that pam has a singleton diamond should make it more likely that she would want to pass. When you suspect a misfit, keep the bidding low. Don't try to rescue partner.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, on to foxy.  She has a very strong hand, right on the border between 3@H and 4@H.  I would strongly consider 4@H, because if I have as little as Qx of hearts and the 10 of clubs, it has plays  and it is difficult for me to bid 4@H with that hand.  As to the play, the defense was really excellent.  Nice going roberta and pam. However, foxy should make 4 hearts. If she simply draws 2 rounds of trumps, and takes the club finesse, she can pitch her losing diamond on the long club. The danger is the cross ruff, so foxy should anticipate that by drawing trump.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Good bidding and play. 3@h bid should not give roberta any problem. She had an awfully good spade suit, easily rebiddable. And if pam does not raise spades, she can always return to hearts if she has to. It is true that the preempt jams her, so she might only have 5 hearts. However, if your spades weren't as good, say KQxxx, then you would have a problem, but with your spades, you can even play opposite a singleton if need be.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, First the bidding. The key is my 3@D bid. Some might ask why I didn't bid 2@H to show my heart suit. However, in competitive auctions, it is usually a good idea for you to show support for partner as early as possible. In fact, when in doubt, raise partner rather than bidding a new suit. My hand got much better as the auction proceeded.  My 4 spades and singleton diamond are both very good. So, the best way for us to get to game if we have it is for me to let partner know the good news about my spade support. |

PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Good question roberta. there is some chance they are artificial, but in real life, particularly with diamonds, they are real 75+% of the time.  It is ok to assume when partner opens one of a minor that partner really has that minor, because you will be right more often than not. Next, I will go over opening lead when partner has bid a suit.|

^-{    OPENING LEAD WHEN PARTNER HAS BID A SUIT    }
^-|
CP||fp||at|

^C@2I recommend you lead the same card when leading partner's suit as when leading any other suit. (There is one @E@3exception, which I will discuss below.)

So, if you have an honor sequence, you lead top of the sequence (A from AK, K from KQ, Q from QJ10 or QJ9, J from J109 or J108). If you have one honor in the suit (A thru J), you lead 4th best or low from 3. The only exception is that you don't lead away from aces in a suit contract.  You all know how I feel about leading unsupported aces. However, if partner bids the suit, the ace is a "less bad" lead. Even so you should avoid leading the ace if you have a better lead such as top of an honor sequence.  

But, if you HAVE to lead from a holding headed by an ace such as Axxx in the suit bid by partner and the contract is not no trump, then you should  lead the ace. 

From a doubleton, you still lead your highest card, even if it is an honor. So, when you lead an honor in partner's suit, partner knows it is a doubleton usually (it could be top of a sequence, but it is usually obvious which it is).

The one exception is from 3 small when you have not supported partner's suit. In that case, it is my feeling that it is usually more important for partner to know that you do not have a doubleton than you do not have an honor. Therefore, only when you have not supported partner, you lead low from 3 small. 

If you have supported partner, you still lead top of nothing (by supporting partner, you promise 3 or more, so partner will not mistake the lead for a doubleton). Leading low from 3 small if you have not supported partner is not universally accepted by all experts, but I feel pretty strongly that it usually works out better.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N This hand shows why bridge is so interesting.  I have been playing for over 35 years, and that is the first time I ever encountered that auction!  I have nothing to add to the bidding, other than to congratulate pam on her creativity. And she played the hand very well. Taking the heart finesse was great. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N As for the lead, I recommend a club, although a spade has merit. My general rule is to lead partner's suit if it makes any sense at all. If roberta had, say, KQJxx of spades, a spade would be better, but since her spades are weak, I think leading her partner's suit is better.  Obviously, since pam bid natural hearts, hearts would not be as good as clubs, particularly since she is leading through my strength. This hand broke all the rules. However, in general, if you lead partner's suit, you will be right more often than not.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N First let us discuss the auction. There is no reason for foxy to transfer with her hand. It simply gives the opponents more information, and does nothing for her side. Basically, with 10 points, foxy knows that 3N is likely to be the best contract, particularly with her long club suit, so just bid it. In general, if you know where the contract should be, you should not dilly dally, just bid what you think you should make.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


AT|
foxyausy: I was thinking slam potential.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N But how did the transfer help you find out if you had slam.  Since you knew pam was going to bid 3@C over 2@S, the 2@S bid really served no purpose.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The way to try for slam is to decide on a convention that makes a slam try.  I personally play all 3 level bids over 1N are natural slam tries, so, if I decided I wanted to try for slam with your hand, I would bid 3@C with most of my partners. The point I am trying to make is that every bid should serve a purpose, and your 2@S bid did not. Now, let me discuss the diamond carding. If roberta plays the Q at trick one, and pam doesn't win the K, I know roberta has the K. And, roberta did a nice job of leading back her "remaining count." Since she had 3 left, she led back her lowest.  Had she started with KQx instead of KQxx, she would have led the K at trick two (assuming she had played the Q at trick one.)|

^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, first the bidding.  I like kia's double. he passed the first time, so Ira will not assume he has too many points, and this way he might be able to compete in the black suits. Once one side finds a fit, it is likely the other side has a fit as well. In this case, it happens to be diamonds, which is hard to find, but the principle is correct. Next, let us discuss alternatives to aggie's 3@H bid.  aggie might bid 3@H just to get in the way, say with 5 Hearts or shortness in one of the black suits. However, on this hand, she has almost an opener, so it is still possible we have game. So, there are several better bids.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N One bid you might try aggie is 3@C, which is a game try, and shows club cards. That is probably best on this hand. another possible bid is redouble, to show extra values. The point is, 3@H is just competitive, so if possible you should make another bid to show extra values.  Now, as to the defense.  Ira has a tough lead. However, notice that when both Ira and Kia led unprotected aces (in spades and clubs), that pin pointed the suits for aggie. If  left to her own devices, she might get both suits wrong, by leading low towards the J. But the lead of the unprotected ace made it easier for her.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Ira has no good lead, so I don't fault him too much for leading the ace, but it did cost. However, kia, if you choose to lead a club, you should lead a low club and make aggie guess. That is a very common position. although I say never lead away from an ace in a suit contract, that applies to opening leads. Sometimes, in the middle of the hand, it is ok as a deceptive play. in this case it can't cost anything, as there is a doubleton in dummy. Yes, it is hard to get over the fear of losing your ace. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N This hand has some interesting points. One thing I have noticed is that many students are reluctant to raise partner immediately.  Basically, unless you think there is a likelihood of slam, let partner know about your fits, particularly in the majors, ASAP. Therefore, I think 3D is your best bid aggie. Granted, if I have a marginal hand, maybe it is nice to know about your hearts, but the way you bid it, there is no way for me to know you have 4 spades. And your 4 card spade support is the most important thing for me to know about. Marty Bergen suggests the rule that if there is a bid available to show 4 card major support and partner does not make it, then opener can assume partner does not have 4 card  support.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N He said that is the way he and Larry Cohen played it for years. and I really like that idea. So I recommend, if you have 4 card support show it whenever possible. As to the play. I was worried about losing 4 tricks, diamond, heart, and 2 clubs. I tried to make it as hard as possible for defenders to find that defense. Ordinarily, I would ruff a diamond, to make it impossible for defenders to lead a diamond without giving me a ruff and sluff, but on this hand, I wanted Ira to lead a diamond. But he was too smart and led a club anyway, figuring that if kia didn't have the ace of clubs, the hand was making anyway.  Ira's defense was very thoughtful. Visualizing how to set the hand is a good habit to get into. |

PG| ***** 145 ***** |

^*Bhondo717:^*N There are 5 cards out higher than the 6 between all three hand.  11 - 6 = 5. You have 4 between you and the dummy, so I have one. In this case, doesn't really matter.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |

nome: How can I tell whether the 6 is from a four or a five card holding?|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, the 5, 4, and 3 are missing, so it is likely from 5.|

NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N well, I should have given myself an undo, lol. I failed to notice I had a weak 2 in spades. And this is a good example of why you should open a weak 2 whenever possible. If I open 2@S, the auction is much more difficult for ira and kia, and aggie will find the best opening lead. So long as kia ducks the spade at least once, it turns out he makes, but it is a lot more worrisome to play.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N This is another good example of competitive bidding principles. First, as kia figured out, it is usually better in a competitive auction to overcall a 5 card suit, particularly a major, than make a takeout double. Now, let us consider aggie's possible bids. There is a case to be made for her bidding 3@H, since she knows we have a 9 card fit. that is still weak, less than a limit raise, because with a limit raise or better she bids 2@S. However, with her 4-3-3-3 distribution and being vulnerable, I don't fault 2@H. but I wouldn't fault 3@H either. Ira has a bit of a problem. He has a strong hand, but only 3 card support, so I think 2@S is his best call. And since I have 6 hearts, and I know we have a 9 card fit as aggie is showing 3 hearts, I must bid 3@H.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N aggie, is right having a minimum hand in a sense, but you will be surprised at how strong a nine card fit turns out to be on lots of hands. You should bid 3, unless there is a good reason not to. Your first instinct should be to bid 3, not 2. Now let us get to kia's bid. Again, using my competitive bidding principles, although kia only has 5 spades, which means only an 8 card fit, he has a singleton heart as compensation, so 3@S is a good bid and there is no way he should consider 4. It turns out 4 is on a finesse, which actually rates to lose based on the auction. As I have the majority of the HCP for the defense, it is more likely any specific high card is in my hand. So, although 4 happens to make on this hand, odds were against it, so 3 is the appropriate place to play.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
delcod1: playing 3@h we go down just 1??|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Yes, losing 2 spades, one club, and 2 diamonds. So again aggie, you can see the power of long trumps, even with few HCP, 3 hearts is a safe place to play. Further, regarding if they should be in 4@S, ira correctly pointed out that it is also lucky that kia only lost 2@C, as there are many distributions where he will lose 3 clubs, if aggie has  the J and another honor. so again 3@S is the place to play.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at| 

** A cardinal rule of defense is NEVER underlead an ace against a suit contract.

** When you suspect a misfit, keep the bidding low. Don't try to rescue partner.

** Usually it is a good idea to play your 2nd highest when signaling, assuming you can afford to.

** Unless you think there is a likelihood of slam, let partner know about your fits, particularly in the majors, ASAP.

** Marty Bergen suggests the rule that if there is a bid available to show 4 card major support and partner does not make it, then opener can assume partner does not have 4 card  support.

** It is usually better in a competitive auction to overcall a 5 card suit, particularly a major, than make a takeout double.

** Usually it is a good idea to play your 2nd highest when signaling, assuming you can afford to.

** Every bid should serve a purpose.
