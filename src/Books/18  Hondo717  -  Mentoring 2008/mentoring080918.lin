^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me Improve these movies by sending suggestions to <kiaaziz@@yahoo.com>|CP||FP||AT|

cp|8|at|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| OK, a couple of comments on the play and the defense.  Should make 3, not 4 if defended and declared perfectly. Your pass was correct aggie. You have a min NT, so you should not accept the invite. But let me suggest one improvement to the play.  Once you realize that trumps break badly, you need to make sure that you can ruff a spade.  So stop drawing trumps, and play a spade to the ace and then another spade.  Even if kia wins and plays a heart, you will still have one heart remaining in your hand to ruff the spade.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way you played it, if kia wins the spade, he can draw your last two trumps.  So that is why you need to stop.  In general, it is a good idea to draw trumps first, but there are sometimes reasons why that is not so, as on this hand.  Now, as to the defense. the opening lead was fine.  Although in general, I find doubletons are not good leads.  kia's other choices are a heart or a spade, and each are fraught with dangers as well.  So it is really a guess. however, I would put doubletons low in priority of good leads to make (unless pard bid the suit of course.)|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT|I would probably lead the 10 of hearts myself.  However, as I said, the diamond has merit also.  The only slip in the defense is kia should not cash the Ace of clubs.  Remember, aces are meant to take honors. it is unlikely that kia will lose his ace of clubs, so there is no hurry to cash.|

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| Now let me discuss the bidding first the bidding. kia does not have an opening hand, so pass is correct. He does not meet the rule of 20. Additionally, Qs and Js in isolation from aces and kings are not that good.  Once aggie opens 1@S, kia could make a takeout double. He almost has opening points. The only flaw is he tends to promise a 4 card heart suit.  So double would be a slight lie, but acceptable. I would not do it myself, as my pard will assume a 4 card heart suit.  aggie did well to bid 2@S over the double by moe. Now kia must take a bid. As he suggested, 2N is probably slightly better than 3@C, as it gets his spade points across. But 3@C is certainly acceptable as well.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| As to the play, basically there are 4 losers, so nice job kia. |

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| Only if I lead the Q of spades, which it turns out I do.  I think you were in a reasonable contract.

NT||cp|8|at|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| OK, this defense had some similarities to the last hand.  In particular, moe should not be in such a hurry to cash the K of clubs, as it sets up my J.  Often, patience on defense will yield better results.  Remember, your honors do better when they capture the opponents honors.  It is hard to know sometimes when it is right to cash, but in this case, with the ace of spades, moe is certain to have at least one more opportunity to cash.  So just get out with a heart, and see what happens. Basically, moe, I just had more patience on offense than you had on defense :).|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| That was terrific defense. My only comment is on the opening lead. Typically, in NT, the lead of an ace tends to show a fairly solid suit. It asks partner to pitch an honor if he has one, otherwise give count. In this case moe, a low club is the appropriate lead. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT|Now as to the bidding.  Typically, your partner assumes you have an opening hand when you overcall a weak 2 bid. So 3@H is ok with aggie's hand.  However,  the problem with the hand is what I mentioned a couple of hands ago, mostly Qs and Js, but still ok to bid 3@H because the hand meets Rule 20.|

delcod1: Even with a flat minimum hand?|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


cp|8|at|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| If you had a game forcing hand, then 3@S would be fine. The problem is, what if I only have 4 spades. Therefore, since you have a minimum hand, you have to pass. Even if I have 5 spades, NT still likely to be good contract given your hand.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| OK, aggie, I think on this hand, you might have planned a bit better.  What is your best suit between the 2 hands?|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|    delcod1: @s.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


cp|8|at|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| So why didn't you start with them?  If moe has the J, you have at least 2 spade tricks, and if they break 3-3, 3 spade tricks.  So, if you are very lucky, you can get 3@S, 3@C, 1@H and 1@D.  And if not, then you can hope for 2 heart tricks by guessing the J.  Don't even bother with diamonds.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| If you are trying for a 3-3 break, might as well try spades, as that will likely be more productive.  At least you will take 2 spade tricks no matter how the suit is divided.  With diamonds, you only get an extra trick if they are 3-3. You lead a low spade towards the 10 and hope moe has the J. If not, then kia wins the J, you knock out the ace, and at least you get 2 spade tricks.  And it turns out, then you take 8 tricks, because spades happen to be very favorable.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT| But even if they are not, at least you set up 2 tricks for yourself. Whereas with diamonds, 1.  3-3 break only occurs a little more than 1/3 of the time, so the percentages of taking 2@D tricks are pretty low.

@D@D As you already know you can play this and all hands double dummy. Give it a try, before clicking the forward arrow, based on Howard's recommendations.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| First the auction. was generally good, I just have a few observations.  ally has an optional opening hand. The two negatives are she does not meet the rule of 20 and she mostly has queens and jacks.  So, I probably wouldn't open, but ok that she did. And my negative double was a bit light.  Generally, at the one level you can make a negative double with 6 points.  Had my Q of hearts been the Q of spades, I have a clear negative double.  However, because my Q is in east's suit, it does not carry full value, as it does not rate to fit well with partner.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| In general, you should tend to devalue cards in the opponents suits, and value cards in pard's suits more. Now, as far as pat (west) bid, redouble is ok, to show points as would be 2N right away. 2N has a tactical advantage in that it takes up more bidding room. And 1@S and 2@D are fine. Should they be in game. The answer is yes.  Basically, it depends on either south having one of the two diamond honors (75%) or a 3-3 break (36%).  So, the game is odds on favorite, probably around 80% but it is hard to bid it.  So I don't blame them for missing game.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| The answer may surprise you regarding whether vul should be taken into account when bidding game.  The reason being, the vulnerable game bonus is 200 points more than the non-vul bonus, so the higher reward makes the risk even more worth it. Next if the auction goes pass by ally, then 1@H-2@C-2@D-2N-3@D-3N is an ok auction. Whether East should bid 2N over 1@C,  showing 5/5 in the reds, that is possible, but the hearts are so good, I like 1@H better.|

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Now, this was an interesting hand, particularly to bid.  First, just a brief comment about my first pass. Just like on earlier hand , I have a balanced 12 count which does not meet the rule of 20, so I feel pass is best.  Now, as far as East, that is the most interesting. It's not like you get 6-6 hands very often, so standard bidding is not really geared to handle them, nor do you get much practice, lol.  However, let me give some general guidelines.  With 2 suits of equal length, you tend to bid the higher ranking suit first.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| So 1@D is officially the correct bid. Now, lynne told me her justification for opening 1@C is she wanted to reverse.  There is some merit to her argument, in that, despite her 13 HCP, her hand is certainly very powerful, more than enough for a reverse.   However, when you reverse, you are saying that the first suit you opened is longer than the 2nd, usually your 2nd suit is 4 card suit. So by opening 1@C and reversing into diamonds, lynne is severely distorting her distribution. |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, believe it or not, even if the K of spades was a low spade, one could make a case that her hand is good enough for a jump shift, so she could open 1@D and jump to 3@C.  Given lynne opened 1@C, another possibility is for her to bid 3@D over 2@H.  So 1@C followed by a rebid of 2@D followed by a rebid of 3@D would almost get her distribution across. It would show 6 clubs and 5 diamonds and a reverse.  So that would have been ok as well.  However, I wouldn't worry about messing up 6-6 hands, as you wont get one for another 3 or 4 years, lol. |

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Now, before we get to the bidding, let me discuss lynne's diamond plays, and why they were good.  If partner leads a suit in NT, and you have A10 or K10, and there is an honor on the board, as on this hand, it is correct to play the 10.  Basically, if I have the K or J of diamonds, it is the right play. If I have the J, then the 10 forces the K.  And if I have the K, then pat has Jx and a diamond stopper anyway, so the 10 gets out the J, and we run the suit next time I get in.  And even though I had neither honor, the play still worked fine. |
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| So, with A10 or K10, and an honor in dummy, play the 10 on an opening NT lead.|

cp|8|at|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Then A is right, followed by the 10.  The idea is you want the ace to capture the Q, but if there is nothing to capture, might as well play the ace.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Now, as to whether pat should open 1@S or 1N.  There is controversy here.  However, I think the modern view is tending to opening all 15-17 balanced 1N, even with a 5 card major. That is what I recommend. Otherwise, it is hard to make a rebid on your second bid. 1N really gives quite a good description.  Now, let's think about the tradeoffs.  If you open 1N, you describe your hand pretty well. The only hand you have to worry about is if responder has exactly 3 card support, and 4 of your major is better than 3N.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| However, if responder  has 4 card support, will bid Stayman and you get to your major anyway.  So since, there are only a few hands where 4 of major makes, 3N does not, and responder has exactly 3 card support, opening 1N helps way more often than it hurts.  As to why some people open 1N with hearts, and 1S with spades, I have no clue. |

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Nice play.  As I mentioned to the kibitzers, my heart void was a minus, and in fact made the hand hard to play.  However, lynne, you started out wonderfully, and I thought you were going to make it.  When you ruff the last heart, instead of playing a low diamond, you can simply ruff a club high to get to dummy, draw the last trump, pitching a diamond from dummy, and then lead to the ace of diamonds and cash your last 2 clubs.  You managed to set up clubs, which was very good. you just forgot to use them after you set them up.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |

ArLady: Couldn't she just cross ruff the whole hand and loose only three ?|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


cp|8|at|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Well, that will work if the opponents are nice enough not to lead trumps when the get in with the ace of clubs. So a cross ruf is an alternate play, but lynne's line works as well.

@D@D Before you click the forward arrow, you can play this hand double dummy as Howard outlined.  This feature is available in all boards.@D@D |

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| You played the hand correctly anne. Now, a few things to talk about. First, the bidding.  Once responder bids Stayman, he is promising at least one 4 card major  and the NT opener should be aware of that. Therefore, in this auction, once anne bids 2@H over 2@C, kia can bid 2N, because anne is aware that kia has a 4 card major; if it's not hearts, it has to be spades, so if she has  spades she can bid them herself.  As far as anne opening 1N with a 5 card major, that is what a majority of experts advocate these days and I discussed it in earlier board.  Opening 1N with five card major tends to work out better almost all the time.|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Next, let me discuss how aggie needs to discard.  There is a general rule known as "keep parity with dummy."  What that means is, in general, when dummy has a long suit that is a potential source of tricks, you should try and keep the same length as dummy in that suit.  The reason being, you want to make sure declarer cannot score their low card.  On this particular hand, the key suit for aggie is spades.  If anne has the ace, aggie needs to keep the J to prevent anne from being able to cash her 10 of spades.  That is a very good example of "keeping parity" with the dummy. That comes up quite a bit, and is important when defending.|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| As to the play, anne has 2 choices.  She can either take the diamond finesse or play for hearts to break either 3-3 or the J to drop doubleton. A 3-3 break is against the odds, about 36%, barely over 1/3, whereas a finesse is 50%. so anne made the right choice in choosing the diamond finesse.  The only other thing to know is, if dropping the doubleton J is also possible, as on this hand where anne has AKQ10, then the odds do increase significantly, to almost 50%. but at  best, either line is right, even taking the doubleton J into account.|

However, if you can try for overtricks without endangering the contract, you might as well go for it, as it can be worth a couple of imps. In this case, ducking one diamond won't hurt, and when we play a second diamond, if I happen to have KQ, as I did, kia can go for overtricks.

**   Don't be in a hurry to cash your aces unless you think the trick is going away.

**   Often, patience on defense will yield better results.

**   Remember, your honors do better when they capture the opponents honors.

**   If partner leads a suit in NT, and you have A10 or K10, and there is an honor on the board, as on this hand, it is correct to play the 10.

**   "keep parity with dummy"  means, when dummy has a long suit that is a potential source of tricks, you should try and keep the same length as dummy in that suit.

**   If you can try for overtricks without endangering the contract, you might as well go for it, as it can be worth a couple of imps
