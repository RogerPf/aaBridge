^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2hondo717: Interesting hand. First the bidding. Spades is a better contract than hearts, but my 2@D overcall makes it hard for them to find spades. Even though I don't really have enough points for an overcall, my diamond suit is so good, I shaded my call a little. deb's negative double is good. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
nome: Does she have enough points for a two level neg. X? |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: Yes, but not enough for a two level spade bid. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Regarding kia's question, you can make a negative double with as few as 6 or 7 points at the 2 level, if your shape warrants it, and deb's shape does. As deb says, if she had much more, she would bid 2@S. But terry does have a problem. He knows there are enough HCP for game, but he is not sure what the best contract is. deb is only promising 4 spades with her negative double. If she has a weaker hand, she can have 5 spades, as on this hand, but she might only have 4. So with solid hearts, I think terry made a reasonable decision. In fact, with careful play, the hand can be made. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Badmonster: Could he bid 3@d which either says bid 3nt with a @d stopper or shows support? Giving a choice of games? |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, he could bid 3@D. What would you bid over 3@D deb? |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|  Badmonster: 3@s. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: That would get you to 4 spades then and it makes I think. You lose 2 clubs and a spade.
Badmonster: I have a @d stopper but my clubs are not everything a neg double might promise. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Yes, so you might choose to bid 3NT which is tougher, but that makes as well, because kia has a doubleton diamond, and cannot lead diamonds, but has all the other entries. The best contract is 4 spades, which does make. Okay let me first play the hand  4 hearts terry. I will set up a new deal, and then reload the hand. you move to south, and me to east. |

hondo717: Yes, because kia had doubleton diamond the contract is down 1. Well, there were still two important plays on this hand. One was to duck the first diamond, so that kia could not lead a diamond when he got in. The second was to duck a spade early, to establish the spades while retaining the board entry. Now let us try the hand with 4@S cointract. |

UP|20|PF|Y|
AT|
hondo717: First let us answer kia's question. Is he good enough to bid 2 hearts? If deb had opened 1@C or 1@D, he has a clear 1H bid. However, his suit is a little weak for bidding 2@H, particularly since some of his points are in spades. So, on balance, I think pass is best. 2@H is a bit too aggressive. But on some hands it could work out well but not on this hand. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now let us get to deb's rebid. She has 3 choices of rebids. 2 spades, which should show six. 2N, which should show a balanced hand and 3@C. Now, 3@C is an interesting bid, because it depends on how you play what strength 3@C shows. Since 3@C is a "reverse" (you are voluntarily bidding past your suit at the 2 level), I play it shows extra values. But some people play that once terry makes a 2 over 1 game forcing call, 3@C does not show extras. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: I agree that 3@C showing extras is a good way to play because it allows you to get to some slams that would be impossible to bid otherwise. And I am willing to occasionally have an awkward rebid problem. However, because your spades are not very good, I think I would choose to rebid 2N with your hand deb, particularly since terry bid hearts and 2 spades would tend to show six spades, or at least a good 5 card suit. But, as I said, it is just a matter of which flawed bid you choose to make. |

^B@2hondo717: The bidding was fine. If there were some other defenders, who routinely (and often incorrectly) lead the unbid major against NT, the contract would make. As to the play. the only hope is for the clubs to come in. There are two possibilities to playing the clubs. Oone is to play for Q10 doubleton, in which case the clubs run. The other, and I think slightly better play, it to hope terry has the Q and 10, and finesse him twice. In this case neither works. |

^B@2hondo717: First the auction. Although my suit is weak, as many of you know, I think you should preempt whenever possible. I tend to use suit length to determine the level of the preempt, so since I had a seven card suit, I preempted to the 3 level that gave ally a problem. In modern bridge, where most doubles are not penalty, it is hard to get penalized. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: ally has the appropriate distribution for a negative double, she is a bit weak, but I think the double is better than passing. And moe has a clear 3@S bid. not 4@S, he needs at least 2 more points to bid 4@S, and his Q of diamonds is probably useless. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: I tend to have the length I promised when I preempt. because I like the law of total tricks to determine my level. That way, pard can judge when to sacrifice if the opps bid game. However, some people would preempt at the 3 level with a six card suit. |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: As to the play. I think moe is always down at least one, due to the bad spade break. My only suggestion is that moe use his ace of diamonds entry to take the club finesse, or spade finesse, really no need to pitch a diamond right away. Drawing trumps first is probably better. |

^B@2hondo717: OK, marian, what is your plan? How many potential losers do you have? The problem on this hand is what to do with the spades. marian has no club losers and one diamond loser, and no spade losers if she trumps 3 spades or she can try and pitch a spade on a diamond if the ace of diamonds is on side, and lose 2 hearts.|

^B@2hondo717: This is a good example of where you need to come up with a plan at trick one, as your initial plan of playing a heart right away, might have caused the contract to fail.  Everyone should really get in the habit of planning the play at trick one on every hand.  If you watch me play, you will note that I almost always play slowly to the first trick. Once I come up with a plan, then I just play the hand out, unless something unexpected  happens. So I cannot emphasize enough that planning at trick one is a very good habit|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: By "planning",  I mean don't play even from dummy, until you have decided on your plan for the hand. For example, on this hand, it is best to play the K of clubs from dummy, to preserve the Ace of clubs as an entry to your hand for ruffing spades. With no planning, you might just play low from dummy, which would mess up your entries to your hand. |

^B@2mausie: When is it wise to lead a singleton..I have been told that this kind of lead can be potentially damaging to Partner's hand . |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: It is ok to lead a singleton if the opps have not bid the suit. Hwever, it is a risk/reward issue. Because sometimes it finesses partner. But, in general, a singleton is a good lead if the opps have not bid the suit, and pard has not bid another suit. A singleton is a particularly good lead if you have a trump trick, and are pretty sure you can get to pard to give you a ruff. |

^B@2hondo717: Now, since ally didn't jump, I know she cannot have more than 15 points. Since I only have 9 hcp and a doubleton, pass would be reasonable. However, it is likely we have a 9 card fit, so I will make a game try, in case ally has 14 or 15. I like to make what is known as "help suit" game tries. That means if I bid a new suit, I want partner to place extra values on honors in the suit I bid, because I have an honor or two in the suit I bid. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Sometimes, you can bid more aggressively if you have a good fit. And having matching honors in a suit is one aspect of a good fit. So a help suit game try says "pard, I have an honor or two in the suit I just bid; if you have some help there, that is good" and bid game. |

^B@2hondo717: First the bidding. The 2@D bid gives ally a problem. I would bid 2N with her hand, although she only has one diamond stopper. Double is not an option, because ally only has 2 spades. Pass is conservative, but acceptable. However, once marian bids 2@S, I think 2N is somewhat of an underbid. marian must have at least 9 or 10 points, so there are enough points for game. So ally has a couple of choices over 2@S. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|
^B@2One would be 3N. The other would be 3@D, asking marion to bid 3N with a diamond stopper. Now, if ally had bid 2N over 2@D, then systems are on. In that case, marian can bid 4@H, which is a spade transfer. |

^B@2hondo717: OK, some interesting bidding issues here. First of all, let us discuss moe's 2@H call. That shows a limit raise in spades. I personally like that bid to promise 4 card support, but many people play it only guarantees 3 card support. I also play a new suit by overcaller's partner is forcing, so I would have bid 2@C with moe's hand. However, that is a matter of style and partnership discussion. |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Over moe's 2@H, ally might consider doubling, to show her sixth heart. You should not double a cue bid for no reason, it should show something extra, in this case an extra heart. The other issue is what marian should do over 1@S overcall. marian might consider bidding 1N, which shows 8-10 or so with a spade stopper. |

^B@2hondo717: This is an interesting tactical bidding problem hand. deb is a bit weak for 2@S, but her singleton heart is nice. I have a problem over 2@S. However, with 5 card trump support, I can bid 4@H as I did. On the other hand, before doing that, I need to decide what I am going to do if kia bids 4@S. If I am not going to double, a case can be made that I should only bid 3@H, so as not to push them into game. And I wasn't sure what to do over 4S. I decided that we might not be making 4H. And that just setting them at 4@S would be fine. However, I was wrong. I need to double. Again, this hand illustrates why preempts work so well. |

^B@2hondo717: That is not the correct lead, although it happens to work on this hand. You should lead low from that holding against NT, to preserve entries in deb's hand. The @H8 was the correct lead.  Now, from my perspective, I can count 7 tricks for sure, 2 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs, and 2 diamonds. My best shot is to try for 4 diamond tricks. If the finesse loses, I have to hope kia started with only 4 hearts. |

^B@2hondo717: That was an unlucky hand for us. But let us use it as an opportunity to discuss opening leads in NT when you have honors. In particular, let us discuss what honor leads mean in NT. When you lead the Ace against NT, you typically do that with a solid suit, perhaps missing one honor. It tells partner to pitch his highest honor, if he has one. Otherwise, partner is supposed to give count. For example, on the Ace of hearts, deb should pitch the Q or J if she had it. |
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: With her holding in this hand, she should play the 3, showing 3 cards in the suit. If she had, for example, 93 of hearts, instead of 953, she would play the 9 showing a doubleton. To review, the lead of an ace against NT says "Pard, pitch an honor if you have it, otherwise give count." Now, let me discuss the lead of the K. Typically, you lead K from KQJ and other cards, or KQ10 and other cards, such as KQJxx or KQ10xx. The lead of the K says, "pard, signal high with the Ace or J." |
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: This is particularly useful if you hold KQ10. Because a good declarer will almost always duck the K, even if he has the A and opening leader needs to know whether partner has the J or not. If declarer started with AJ, opening leader does not want to lead the suit again, as it gives declarer an extra trick. However, if pard has the A or J, then leader can continue the suit. So, by signaling high with the A or J, opening leader knows whether or not it is safe to continue. BTW, if declarer ducks with AJ, that is known as a "Bath Coup."|

^B@2hondo717: Now let me discuss terry's opening lead. There are two different theories about it. I play, if I am leading partner's suit, and have not supported it, I lead count, even if I don't have an honor. That way, partner knows whether I have a doubleton or not. If you had supported my suit by bidding 2@S, then the 7 would be correct, because then I know you have at least 3. But here you should lead 3 because you did not support. So an undo is coming up. |
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2Essentially most of the time when you have not supported, you make the same lead you would have made anyway. So from QJ98 you lead the Q, from AK10 you lead the A, etc. The only difference is from 3 or 4 small, where you lead low, the idea being it is more important to provide partner with count information rather than information about honors. If partner has bid a suit, he presumably has 5 or more, and if you have 3 or more, and if dummy has 2 or 3, partner can often work out declarer's holding based on knowing your count. |
PG| ***** 249 ***** |


UP||NT|
^B@2hondo717: Obviously, if you have supported, you are already promising 3 or more, so you can lead high with no honor, since partner already has a good idea about your count. |

You have one spade loser, 1 diamond loser (assuming diamonds break 3-2), and one club loser. If you draw the last trump before playing diamonds, you make the hand, since terry does not get his J of hearts. |

^B@2hondo717: Let me discuss why the auction 1@D - P - 1N tends to mean the 1N bidder has clubs. By bidding 1NT responder is denying 4 hearts and 4 spades. Therefore, at best, responder is 3-3 in the majors. Responder doesn't have 5 diamonds, because then he would bid 3 diamonds (assuming inverted raises.) Therefore, responder must have at least 3 clubs, since at worst he is 3-3-4-3 and usually he has 4 or more clubs. So, if the auction goes 1@D - 1N, it is ok for you to assume responder has some clubs. |

^B@2nome: To bid after a 1NT overcall is one of my many bridge shortcomings. I assume that you have 15-16 points and I have enough to bid part score. |

15-18 actually. But  you have enough to double. Basically, if you have 9 or more points, you are likely to set 1N. double by you here is penalty. So your best bid is double. |

hondo717: terry, you should bid your best suit as an escape. I will discuss how to bid over 1N overcalls after the hand is over. |

^B@2hondo717: OK, let us discuss how to bid after an opponent has overcalled 1N. If pard opens and the next person bids 1N, then responder has the following options:
^DWith a good 8 or more, responder should double, because it is likely 1N will go down. Therefore, any suit bid by responder is to play, and simply shows a long suit. For example 1@D-1N-2@H means responder wants to play 2@H. Basically, responder is required to double to show a strong hand, therefore any suit bid is weaker, and to play. |

^B@2hondo717: Now, what happen  if the 1N bid is doubled. All bids by the partner of the 1N overcaller are natural. Any suit bid by the partner is to play. Therefore, partner of the 1N bidder should bid his best 5 card suit. A pass by responder shows a willingness to play 1N doubled. With the "nightmare" hand, a balanced hand with very few points, partner should redouble. Then 1N opener bids his cheapest 4 card suit, responder usually passes with 3 card or more support. |

^B@2hondo717: BTW, if kia had passed the systems are on and terry could bid transferes and Staymn. However, once kia doubles, terry must scramble to get us out of 1N doubled, so all bids are natural. |

Badmonster: with a very distributional hand and few points can partner of 1nt bidder make a move?  Like a jump bid maybe? |
PG| ***** 309 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Sure, pard can bid at the 3 level with a long suit and few points. Sort of like a weak jump shift. |
