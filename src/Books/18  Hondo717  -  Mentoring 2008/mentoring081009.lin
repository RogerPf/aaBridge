Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|OK, a few things on the auction first. The reason I passed is because it looks like a misfit hand, and I don't have six points. Some people might bid 1N with my hand, worrying about the singleton heart, but that can often get you in trouble. What happens if moe then bids 3@H, for example. Now, you are in big trouble. So, when you have a marginal bid, and a misfit with partner, best to pass. Now, kia and joyce managed to go plus, so they do all right on this board, although they can probably make 1 or 2 NT.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|In general, it is not a good idea to let the opponents play at the one level. So joyce should balance and make some bid. Her two choices are double and 1N. 1N technically shows 11-14, so she is a point weak. if her hearts had been slightly better, it would have been ok, but in this case, double is probably best. Then, kia would have then probably bid 1 or 2 NT, and that's where they end up.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |

tseager44: if n/s no fit......e/w also...so what can they do to balance...I would pass all of the hands.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|You rarely get a good result letting the opponents play at the one level. If you can beat them at the one level, you can usually make something yourself. So, you increase your odds by balancing. Every once in a while, you will get too high, and turn a plus into a minus, but more often than not, you will turn a minus into a plus.  My feeling is that you should pretty much never let the opponents play at the one level, unless you have a real stack in their suit. Basically, you need to understand the theory of balancing.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The idea is that if the auction goes 1 something, pass, pass, the points are pretty evenly split. Now, if you are in pass out seat, even with as little as 6 or 7 points, partner must have a pretty good hand, at least 11 or 12. So, when you "balance", that is make a bid in pass out seat, you are bidding for the entire partnership, not just your hand. The worse your hand, the more likely the better partner's hand is. It works out that way almost all of the time, as it did on this hand. kia rightfully passed with a 12 count, and joyce had 10, so they had a majority of the points.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|lots to discuss. The play and defense are particularly noteworthy, but first the bidding, just to keep things orderly. The first few bids are fine. I think kia was somewhat aggressive making a takeout double.  He has the appropriate distribution, and he passed originally, so he doesn't have an opening hand, but having only 6 HCP in the unbid suits is a bit of a stretch.  Now, let me discuss support doubles and redoubles.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|If I open one of a minor, and partner bids one of a major, and the intervening opponent makes an overcall or double, some people play a convention known as "support double/redouble." If the intervening bid is a double, a redouble by me shows 3 card support for the major. And if the intervening bid is an overcall (1@S for example), a double by me shows 3 card support. In other words, the double or redouble shows exactly 3 card support for the major, whereas a raise would guarantee 4 card support. Once I show 3 card support, moe has a great hand and rightfully bids 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, as to the play, moe needs to plan the hand out slightly better. He has a potential loser in spades, in  hearts, and up to 2 diamond losers. He can get rid of his spade loser on the club, if he plans carefully. I think what he should do, at trick 2, play a club to the K, and then play a heart to the K.  Then he can play the A of clubs, pitching his spade loser. Then, he can ruff a spade back to his hand, and play a diamond towards the Q.  That pretty much guarantees the contract no matter what.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, a comment on the defense. When joyce gets in with the K of diamonds, a spade back is pretty clear.  Partner led the K of spades, so joyce knows he has the Q and she should make sure their side gets their spade trick. So the two important points are:
1) Plan the hand out at trick one, counting your losers and figuring out how to get rid of them. Although your first instinct should be to draw trumps, sometimes you have to delay in order to take care of other losers
2) Once your partner picks a defense, you should stick to it, unless there is a real good reason to switch.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, a couple of very small suggestions, although this was well done. Since joyce is not playing 2 over 1, 3@H is probably a bit better than 4@H. She does have great heart support, but kia might only have 10 points, so I am not sure she wants to force to game. However, even if she only bids 3@H, kia did well to look for slam. He knows they have what is known as a "double fit", a fit in 2 suits, since he also has spades. And a double fit is a very good thing, and means you will tend to make more tricks.  kia also has control of both minor suits as well. So he showed excellent judgement in trying for slam.|

jpb1130: Should I have gone to 3NT Howard?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT||cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, it is close as to whether or not you should be in game.  For those of you who play new minor forcing, joyce's bid would be 2@D, asking kia to show either 4 hearts or 3 card spade support. And kia would bid 2@S and joyce would bid 3@S, and then kia could either pass or bid 4@S. However,  4 spades is basically on the spade finesse. It turns out 3N is a hair better, although with a worse heart split that is down as well.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Regarding whether you should stretch to bid game or not. It actually turns out that when you are vulnerable, you should be more aggressive about bidding game than when you are non-vulnerable  when you are playing imps. The reason for that is the difference between 620 and 170 is much greater than the difference between 420 and 170. So, the rewards for bidding vulnerable games are higher than for non-vul games. However, I think a better philosophy is to stretch for all games. That is not to say that either kia or joyce should bid game on this hand, it is marginal, and I would not argue with either bidding or not bidding game.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Some comments on both the bidding and play.  And btw, colleen, your bidding was impeccable on this hand :). Now, let us look at lisa's options over 1@H.  A new suit by lisa is forcing and usually shows a 5 card suit.  If you have support, unless you have a strong hand, you should just raise if possible.   Raising has preemptive value as well as giving a good description of your hand. So lisa's best bid is probably 2@H. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Once lisa bids 1@S, colleen should assume she has 5 spades and a pretty good hand. so 3@S is an excellent call. In fact, because colleen has a singleton in roberta's suit, which is very powerful, one could make a case that 4@S is a reasonable bid, although I like 3@S a bit better. As to the play, as you know, I strongly discourage leading aces against a suit, because aces are meant to capture kings and queens.  However, poor roberta has no choice  and, given she has the ace of spades, the A of diamonds is a good choice, because it is quite possible she can get a diamond ruff. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Other than that the play was fine, with one exception. At trick six, once roberta ruffs a heart, and plays a spade, lisa should go up with the K of spades. And, I think you lost track of trump lisa. It is a common mistake to lose track of trumps when there is a ruff by the opponents. Remember, when figuring out how many trumps are out, to take a ruff by the opponents into account.  So really concentrate once there is a ruff and deduct one from the number of trumps right away in your head.|

hondo717: |cp||at|We can focus on the play on this hand.  roberta took a good line to start with. Now let me discuss trick two. There is a good rule to follow about covering an honor in dummy. When there are two honors in dummy, such as QJ of hearts on this hand, it is better to not cover the first honor  particularly with the 9 being on the board.  If lisa does not cover the first honor, then roberta has to decide whether or not to play the J and hope the 10 drops, or play a low heart.  You should always cover the last honor on the board. So with QJ10, wait until the 10 is played. if QJ, as in this case, wait until the J is played. |

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The only exception is if you started with exactly two to the K, then you might cover the first. First of all, suppose partner has singleton ace. unlikely on this hand, but possible  and second, if partner has 10, then roberta has to guess what to do on the second heart trick. Now continuing the play. Once roberta gets back to the board with the J of hearts, playing a spade to the 10 was good. It is likely she will get 2 spades no matter what. The only small error she made (at trick 6) was playing the third round of hearts before knocking out the ace of spades.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|As she did, if hearts don't break 3-3, and they didn't she sets up a heart trick for lisa.  If she plays a spade before playing the 9 of hearts, then lisa can't cash her heart, and roberta makes 2. To make the contract, roberta, you need to knock out the ace of spades. So might as well do it while you retain control of hearts.|

hondo717: |cp||at|In "new minor forcing" if I open one of a minor, and then rebid 1N, if you bid the other minor (in this case 2@D) that is an artificial bid, resembling Stayman asking me about my major suit holdings. Just like with Stayman, if I have 4 hearts, I bid 2@H. Further,  because my 1N bid already denied 4 cards in Spades, I would bid 2@S if I have 3 card spade support. In this case you probably want to play in Spades had I bid 2@S with three  Spades support. The responder must have at least an invitational hand to bid new minor forcing - 8 points at least.|

mb|p|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, I know because you bid new minor forcing, that you must have 5 spades.  So, if I have 3 spades, I would bid 4 spades. But, my next bid denies three Spades and shows four Hearts.|

hondo717: |cp||at|We already discussed the auction so let us discuss the play. In NT only, if lisa chooses to lead a diamond, I recommend a small diamond, rather than the K.  In NT, you really should only lead the K from KQ if you have at least a 5 card suit.  In a suit contract, you need to lead the K, because it is quite possible the 3rd round will be ruffed. But in NT, that is never a problem. Now, once lisa leads the K, colleen made a nice duck. There is actually a name for that play, it is known as a "Bath Coup."|

hondo717: |cp||at|1N is not forcing after an overcall. It is only after an opening bid. You need to raise spades, probably 3 spades is best. 3@S  shows less than a limit raise with 4 card support, exactly what you have. I will give you an undo.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Let me discuss the bidding a little.  This is a good example of modern competitive bidding.  Although my spades are pretty bad, because I have a singleton diamond, I still think 1@S will work out more often than not. And lisa's 3@S bid is a good example of putting pressure on roberta. roberta has to guess what to bid.  If her hand was slightly worse, or she didn't have a double spade stopper, she would have a difficult bid. On this hand, they ended up in the right place However, there are many hands where the bidding would end up making it difficult for them to find the right contract. That is why I advocate aggressive bidding, particularly when you have found a fit. |

^-{     NEW MINOR FORCING    }
^-|
CP||fp||at|

^C@2New minor forcing (NMF) is a convention that is used to discover a major suit fit after opener has rebid 1N or @E@32N after opening one of a minor and receiving a response of one of a major. 

Example auctions would be 1@D-P-1H-P-1N or 1@C-P-1@S--2N. If you decide to play NMF, then if responder bids the other minor (clubs if the opening bid was diamonds, and diamonds if the opening bid was clubs), that is the new minor forcing convention. 

Opener is asked to describe his length in the majors. If he has 4 cards in the unbid major, he bids that suit. If he has 3 card support for the major bid by responder, he raises responder (note that opener can not have 4 cards in responder's major, because he would have raised immediately rather than bidding NT). 

If he has both, you need to have some agreement. I recommend that opener prefer bidding the 4 card major rather than showing 3 card support.

As an example, let us use the auction 1@C-P-1@H-P-1N-P-2@D-P. Opener would bid 2@H with 3 card heart support, 2@S with 4 spades (if he has both, I recommend opener bid 2@S), and 2N with neither.

Note that if opener has both the other 4 card major and 3 card support, and responder returns to NT, opener is obligated to return to the suit he did not bid. So, if the auction goes 1@C-P-1@H-P-1N-P-2@D-P-2@S-P-3N, opener should bid 4 hearts if he has 3 card heart support. The reason is responder will only bid NMF if he has a 5 card major or the other major (or both); with the auction in question, responder must have 5 hearts.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at| 

**  You rarely get a good result letting the opponents play at the one level. If you can beat them at the one level, you can usually make something yourself. So, you increase your odds by balancing.

**  You should pretty much never let the opponents play at the one level, unless you have a real stack in their suit.

**  When you "balance", that is make a bid in pass out seat, you are bidding for the entire partnership, not just your hand.

**  Once your partner picks a defense, you should stick to it, unless there is a real good reason to switch.

**  When there are two honors in dummy, it is better to not cover the first honor  particularly with the 9 being on the board. The only exception is if you started with exactly two to the K, then you might cover the first.
