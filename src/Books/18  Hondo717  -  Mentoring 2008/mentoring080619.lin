^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT|

hondo717: I could have started with either 4 or 5. If I started with 5, I would have played a lower card then the 3, because I would have played 4th best to start with. So, I must have started with 4, leading 4th best. The most likely distribution is I started with 4, and kia started with 3, so now he has one left.|

^B@2hondo717: ok, let us talk about balancing. Basically, if someone opens at the one level and there are two passes, as 4th hand, more often than not you should bid.  The idea is, it is likely the points are divided evenly between each pair.  Even if in 4th seat, you have a pretty bad hand (as little as 8 or 9), it is likely partner has some points. In fact, the less 4th hand has, the more likely it is 2nd hand has some points, but was unable to bid for some reason. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Essentially, when you make a bid in 4th seat, after two passes, you are bidding for both you and your partner. You are in essence "borrowing" some of his points  and partner knows this, so should not be too aggressive. I look at it more like the HCP between the two hands are evenly distributed, so if you don't have them ... partner does. And borrowing 3 points is certainly a good way to think about it, if that makes sense to you. Now, what are your choices in balancing.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|
^B@21. If you have a 5 card suit, you can bid it, even if the quality is not great
2. With 11-14 balanced, and a stopper in opener's suit, you can bid 1N. Note, unlike a direct 1N overcall, you do not need 15-17. The reason is, it is much less dangerous to bid 1N in 4th seat, as the points are evenly balanced, so you will not be doubled.
3. Your third choice, and a frequent one, is to make a takeout double, assuming you have 3 cards in all the unbid suits. In this case, if you had had 2 more HCP, 1N would have been a good bid, as you do have a diamond stopper.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: However, since 1N shows 11-14 and you only have nine, you have to make a double by default. Now you will notice kia correctly only bid 1@H, even though he has 12 HCP, and he would have jumped if you had made a direct takeout double. In other words, if I had opened 1@D, and you had doubled, kia's correct bid is 2@H. However, because Kia knows you balanced, and "borrowed" some of his points, he only bid 1@H, as he did not want to punish you, in case you had a bad hand. Once you hear 1@H, although by the law of total tricks, you can bid 2@H, you should consider passing, because you have a pretty min hand, even for a balancing bid.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, moe, you have some interesting choices over the double. You could bid 1N. That would tend to show 18 or 19. since I passed, you must have a very good hand to bid 1N, and since you didn't open 1N, you must have more than 15-17. Another choice is redouble, that would also tend to show a pretty good hand, probably at least 15 or so, and is sort of a "takeout redouble."|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: I would need a @H stopper.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, the 1N bid is worrisome because of your hearts, but you might do it anyway. But redouble would be good as well.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|
^B@2nome: I did not play the hand correctly, but at the start I counted 3@D, 2@S and 1@C losers so I was resigned with -2.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: You miscounted your losers slightly, you only have 2 diamond losers, so you should be down 1. You should have ruffed one @D loser in dummy. And there is a very small chance I have the A of spades, so you shouldn't give up. Basically, as declarer, if you are within one trick of making your contract, you should try and come up with a scenario, however unlikely, of it making.|

^B@2hondo717: Yes, a well thought out hand. that is the most important point. You came up with a plan to make your contract, and executed it correctly. Now, let us briefly go over major suit fits when pard opens 1N. When pard opens 1N, you should look for a major suit fit if possible. Typically, it is easier to make a major suit contract if you have a fit than NT. So:
With a 5 card major responder should transfer and with a 4 card major, and at least an invitational hand, responder should bid Stayman. |

^B@2hondo717: On this hand, we saw the value of playing cue bids as a limit raise, and raise to 3 as a preempt. Let me explain more. Since we are playing that a cue bid shows a limit raise or better in partner's suit, a 2@D bid is available to show the limit raise. If we were not playing that, then 3@S would be needed to show the limit raise. Since we are playing that 2@D shows the limit raise, this frees up the 3@S bid for another usage. The best usage is to make it a preemptive raise, showing 4 trumps and less than a limit raise. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|
^B@2The reason this is an effective usage is, it is likely the opponents have some makable contract (often game, but a part score at least), and this preemptive usage of 3@S makes it difficult for them to find their best contract. It worked particularly well on this hand, because kia decided initially to pass over 3@S. That made it hard for aggie and kia to get to 4@H. Had kia gone with his instincts, they would have missed game, and they are cold for 5@H as it turns out. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|
^B@2The other issue was aggie's bidding. When kia bid 4@C, he was showing 5+  clubs, but his negative double promised 4 hearts. So aggie needed to help kia out, if she only has a singleton club, she has to pull his bid. either to diamonds or hearts. In this case, with four hearts, the 4@H bid was clear. On the other hand, had she only had 3 bad hearts, she might want to consider bidding 4@D. kia needs to be prepared for a 4@D bid by aggie. The point is, my 3@S bid made it difficult for them, but with some cooperative bidding, they can overcome my bid.|

^B@2hondo717: Well done. Now, let me discuss various bids you can make over an unusual 2N. 
1. Double is penalty oriented, saying you have at least one good minor suit, and are willing to defend. It turns out I believe we set 3@C  2 or 3, so that is our best result, although making 3N is not bad either.
2. A bid of 3@H is natural and forcing.
3. A bid of 3@C or 3@D is a "cue" bid, showing a limit raise or better in spades.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: If you want to get sophisticated, you could assign a different meaning to 3@C and 3@D, but for now I suggest you just play either as a cue bid. Therefore, a bid of 3@S is less than a limit raise, just competing. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


AT|
dee_dee_20: If I double you will not pull?|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No, a double is penalty. A double says, I have good defense, and I would just as soon defend. In your case, with such good minors, it is the perfect bid. I know the modern tendency is to play doubles as takeout bids, but there are certain cases where they are still penalty, this is one of them.|

scoring}

CP||fp||at|

^d @e@2hondo717: Now let me briefly review the scoring of doubled contracts. If you are vulnerable down 1 is @E@3200, and every trick thereafter is 300, so 200, 500, 800, 1100, etc.  If you are not vul, the sequence is 100 for down 1, then 300, 500, 800, 1100. So, at equal vulnerability, you do better beating them 3 than bidding a game because non-vul down 3 is 500, and your game is somewhere around 420-450. And vul down 3 is 800, and your game is around 620-650. If the opponents are vul and you are not, then you only need beat them 2. Because down 2 vul is 500, and your game is 420 or so. 

If you are vul and the opps are not, then you have to beat them 4, because down 4 is 800, down 3 is 500, and your game is worth 620 or so. Basically remember at equal vul must beat them 3, when you are they not, must beat them 4. when they are you not, must beat them 2. It is reasonably important to know that, because it helps you decide when to sacrifice, and when to double their sacrifices.

Now, I will address the cuebids in he next panel.|

cue bids}

^d @e@2Regarding question by lisa about the "cue" bid, there is a general principle at work which I should @E@3explain. If an opponent makes an artificial bid that shows a certain suit or suits, and you then bid that suit, it is still a cue bid even though the opponent did not actually bid that suit. So, with the hand in question, the opponent bid 2NT. You can think of that as the opponent simultaneously bidding clubs and diamonds. Therefore, if you then bid clubs or diamonds yourself, that is not natural, it is still a cue bid. 

The auction 1@S-2N-3@C is essentially the same auction as 1@S-2@C-3@C. My only other point was that both 1@S-2N-3@C and 1@S-2N-3@D are both cue bids. However, an expert partnership might get sophisticated and give different meanings to each of those cue bidding auctions  (for example, 3@C is a limit raise, 3@D a forcing raise), but the essential point is 3@C and 3@D are both cue bids.

Another example of a cue bid after an artificial bid would be 1@S-2@S-3@H. Since the 2@S bidder is showing hearts (and a minor), 3@H is a cue bid showing a limit raise or better. The main difference in this auction is that, since the other minor is unspecified, a minor suit bid by responder is still natural, not a cue bid.

Now, let us resume our play.

SB|ERule 15 ?|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |

^B@2hondo717: um, not even close to an opening hand, by any rule, lol. The rule of 15 says take your HCP and spades, and if they add up to 15, open  seems to me 8 HCP + 5 spades = 13. And the rule of 15 is usually only for 4th seat, some play it in 3rd seat. Personally, I don't like to open unless I meet the rule of 20 and then sometimes I won't open unless I also meet the rule of 15. Let me explain about light openings in 3rd and 4th seat in general. The idea behind the rule of 15 is that you don't want to open light in 4th seat unless you can compete effectively. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT|
^B@2And the best way to compete effectively is to have the spade suit. So, someone smarter than me decided that if the total of your HCP and spades was 15 or more in 4th seat, then you can open, because you can compete effectively. Personally, I don't particularly use the rule of 15. I will explain why, and where it came from. Up until a few years ago, the style among most experts was to have sound openings in 1st and 2nd seat, at least 13 HCP. However, that meant that it was still possible to miss game if both partner's had as little as 10 or 11 HCP and a good fit. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


SB|E|NT|
^B@2So, experts played sound openers in first and second seat, and light openers in 3rd and 4th seat. The rule of 15 was an outgrowth of that philosophy, because if you didn't play it, the pair in 4th seat was often outbid by the other pair. However, young guns such as myself came along and decided we couldn't compete with the experts on skill alone. We decided that we better get in the auction early, and get in the experts way to make it difficult for them. We were actually quite successful doing that, until the experts figured out they better do something about it. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|
^B@2So, the rule of 20 was invented, to allow you to figure out when to open hands with good distribution but fewer HCP. Now most everyone uses the rule of 20 (unfortunately for me, as now I have to rely more on skill :)) However, this made it unnecessary for light openings in 3rd and 4th seat, because the likelihood of missing game no longer existed. Lots of people forget that, and still open light in 3rd or 4th seat. I personally like to use the rule of 20 in all seats, as I find it makes it easier for the partnership to judge where the best contract is. So, my preference is just to use the rule of 20 in all seats, and ignore other rules, such as the rule of 15. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT|
^B@2However, as I often say, that is a matter of style. you need to pick the style that you like best, after listening to all sides of the argument. Just make sure you and your partner agree on whatever style you choose.|

^B@2hondo717: Well played moe. My only other comment on the hand is aggie's pass over 1N. aggie, since you know we have an 8 card fit, by virtue of my support double, it is safe for you to bid at the 2 level. A 2@H bid by you does not show anything extra. I do not know whether you have 4 or 5 hearts, but you know. Remember, on a part score hand, my guideline is that it is safe to bid to the same level as the number of trumps you have. So, with an 8 card fit, the 2 level is safe, with a 9 card fit, the 3 level is safe. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, I like to explain the support double. The most common situation where a support double applies is this type of auction. I open 1 of a minor and partner bids 1 of a major. The next person overcalls after responder's one of a major call. This gives me an extra bid, double, that is not available if there was not an overcall. As with takeout doubles and negative doubles, the idea here is that it is unlikely that opener will have a hand suitable for a penalty double. So, this frees up the double to have some other meaning, assuming you are willing to give up the penalty double in this type of auction. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Therefore, a double over the overcall is known as a "support double", meaning opener has exactly 3 card support for responder's major. A raise of the major (in this case my bidding 2 hearts) shows 4 card support. This allows responder to more precisely gauge how high it is safe to bid, because responder knows exactly how many trumps we have between the 2 hands. Therefore, it is up to responder to make the final decision as to how high to bid, which is why I said aggie should bid 2@H, since she is the one who knows we have an 8 card fit. For all I know, we have a 7 card fit.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: There is a related convention, known as a "support redouble." If kia had made a takeout double, rather than overcalling 1@S, a redouble by me is a "support redouble" showing 3 card support.|

mb|2H|NT|
^B@2nome: My 2@H is not reverse now?|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, that is a good point kia. A reverse is defined as opener|CP|8|at| voluntarily|CP||AT| going past his first suit to bid a higher suit. So, if aggie had passed and kia had bid 2@H, that would be a reverse, because 2@C was available to kia, and he voluntarily bypassed 2@C. However, once aggie bids 2@D, 2@C is not available to kia, and therefore, 2@H is not a reverse. The idea is that a reverse voluntarily takes up more bidding room. But in this case, kia had no choice, and in fact, 2@H takes up less room than 3@C. |

^B@2hondo717: moe can count 9 tricks for sure, 6 clubs, 2 diamonds and a spade. And there is no harm in setting up a heart trick, as he has all suits stop. Had a spade been led (which is not correct in this auction), then he should take his 9 tricks off the top. but since a diamond was (correctly) led, he can set up his tenth trick.   Well done moe.
