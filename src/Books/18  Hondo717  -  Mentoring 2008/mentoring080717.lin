^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.

^*Bhondo717:^*N Six is a great contract. Let me explain how an expert pair might get there. First of all, although I theoretically have only 8 HCP, I have a very big hand. It is worth 8 tricks in diamonds. 3@D is actually a slight underbid by me, but I was worried that we might miss 3N. However, the key to the hand is her singleton spade.  That is why we make 6. The reason I did not bid 6 is because it is possible we have 2 spade losers.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, I am not saying aggie could come up with this bid, but an expert would do one of two things with her hand:

They would either just bid 6 diamonds, figuring that even if all I had was AKxxxxx of diamonds, you can still count 12 tricks by setting up an extra club, and getting a spade ruff.  or; 
They might bid 4@S over 3@D, which is a splinter. However, I think 6@D is best, because aggie has control of the other suits.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
delcod1: I factored my singleton @s when I thought you had 6@ds....that's why I bid Game. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N That is good aggie. But if I have 6 diamonds you can count 11 tricks off the top (6 diamonds, 3 clubs, and 2@H), plus a spade ruff for 12 tricks. I understand that is hard for you. Basically, what an expert would do would be to visualize how the 2 hands fit together in order to figure out that slam makes.  So, 5 diamonds was a good bid. I was just showing how an expert pair might get to six even with only 24 HCP. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Joy_Ga: If N bid 4@S splinter would you then ask for keycards?|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N The problem with the 4@S splinter is I have no controls outside of diamonds, so I am not sure I could bid 6. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|
nome: What does your 2@D over an overcall promises?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Because you bid 1S, my 2D overcall is forcing, promising 5+ diamonds and at least 10 points.

@D@D As a reminder you can play all boards double dummy. You can do it now before clicking the forward arrow. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Yes, that is probably best bid. The rule is, if you can show your major suit fit immediately do so.  Now, some kibs may ask, how come moe didn't show his spades. Because, he has no bid that shows 10 points and 3 spades, so he had to make a forcing bid. I will discuss the auction afterwards.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Lots to discuss.  First the defense. Your diamond duck was fine aggie.  If you don't duck, you set up two diamond tricks for moe, so at worst you traded tricks.  Remember, 2nd hand low is rarely wrong, even when it seems so. You have to get in the habit of thinking, "I must have a very good reason NOT to play 2nd hand low."  And you had none in this hand. The best reason, for example, is if it is the setting trick. Another reason is if you think you need to be on lead to prevent partner from having an awkward lead. And, only very occasionally, you play high if you are sure declarer is out after this round.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Now, when aggie gets in with a spade, she should play the Ace of diamonds, causing moe to run out of trumps.  Never be afraid to make declarer ruff. at worst, it is a safe play, and often it makes him run out of trumps prematurely.  Had you done that aggie, we would have beat the hand. So not only did ducking the ace of diamonds not cost us a trick, but it gave us a way to beat the hand, had you followed through. Hard for you to see, but just remember that making declarer ruff is rarely a bad play. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is at worst a neutral defense because declarer can ruff if he wants anyway. A kib just brought up a good point. It is not right to give declarer a ruff and sluf. So, if both dummy and declarer are out of a suit, you should not play it.  Because, then you are giving declarer a free discard he would not have otherwise.  It is ok to give declarer a ruff, as long as one of the hands still has the suit, or one of the hands is out of trump.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, let us discuss the auction.  moe has an in-between hand.  In sayc, he is a bit weak for 2@H and a bit strong for 2@S.  With such a good heart suit, good distribution (the singleton diamond), and spade support, I like his choice of bidding 2@H. However, once kia bids 3@H, moe should bid 3@S, to allow kia to bid 4 spades with the appropriate hand.  And, it turns out 4 spades or 4 hearts makes, with different play.  Over 3@S, kia should pass, because although he has a good hand, his club points and diamond points may be wasted. Thus, I think 3@H or 3@S is the right level.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
pzee: wouldn't a @s9 lead after trump are cleared be a better line -- only lost 2@s tricks at most.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT| 
^*Bhondo717:^*N As to the play, pzee makes a good point. If moe goes after spades, he will take 4 spades and 5 hearts most likely, if the spade honors are split. aggie also had a question. Over 2@H, should she double? I am glad she is thinking more aggressively. That is very good :). However, in this auction, where moe has made a strong bid, it is a bit dangerous to come in, particularly vulnerable. They have likely at least 23 HCP between them, and you have 12, leaving only 5 or so for me. And they have not yet established a fit, for all you know kia has clubs and spades, moe diamonds and hearts.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N So, in a live auction where the opponents bid strongly and have not yet established a fit, it is best to be more cautious, unless you have a very good suit. The reason you worry when they have not found a fit, is the following:
As I have said previously, if they have a fit, then you likely have a fit as well. If they have a fit, we are short in that suit, making it more likely that we have length in another suit. However, the converse is also true.  If they do not have a fit, then we probably do not have a fit either.|

delcod1: Not sure which one to bid. 1NT or 1@S. Please comment. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT| 
^*Bhondo717:^*N 1@S bid means the same thing as if moe had not doubled, more or less.  One level bids are forcing over a takeout double.  The 1N bid over a takeout double is special. It does tend to deny 4 hearts and 4 spades with 8-10 points. After the double, you don't have to strain as much with a weaker hand to bid, because if I have a strong bid, I now have the opportunity to bid again.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N So. unless you have something important to say, like "I have a major", or "I have a pretty good hand" by bidding 1N, or "I have a very good hand" by redoubling, you can pass with some 6 or 7 counts. |

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well played aggie. Let me discuss the auction a bit more. moe has an interesting choice over 1@D.  One could make a case for either a takeout double or 1@H.  I know moe has a particular liking for takeout doubles, and that is a reasonable choice. However, his other choice is 1@H which I prefer, because I like to get across the fact that I have a 5 card major, particularly in a competitive auction. And, on this hand, that would allow kia to compete to 2@H. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N However, with 3 good spades, the takeout double is ok as well. I just find that getting across my 5 card suit often works out better in competitive auctions.

@D@D Just a reminder that now you can play the hand double dummy.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Nicely played aggie. I had a problem over the 2@H bid. 2@S is a bit of an underbid, and a cue bid (limit raise) is a bit of an overbid, with only 3 trumps and a flat hand. Another choice was 3@C, but my club suit is very bad.  So, I chose the slight underbid of 2@S, fortunately, aggie rescued me by bidding 4.|

dee_dee_20: A little lie  I would  cue bid with KQ@s. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N cue bid is reasonable as well. If my hand was more distributional, I would have.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N I partly bid 2@S to show you that I devalue hands that are 4-3-3-3. I usually deduct 1 to 1.5 points for them, but 3@H is certainly a good choice as well. However, with no interference, since we are playing 2 over 1, I can bid 1N forcing and then bid 3@S.  That shows a limit raise with 3 card support.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N First the bidding. Everything fine up to kia. He has a hard hand to bid, but I might try 2@C with his hand, in case aggie has a good hand. Given kia passes, even though I passed, moe has a second bid. The question here is more tactics. One spade is certainly reasonable. But 2@D is slightly more preemptive, in fact, one could make a case for 3@D just to get in their way. Again, that is more a tactical decision than anything else. moe was going for more precision, hoping we might outbid them in spades. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*NI would probably bid 3@D, as a preemptive tactic. Either could be right.  aggie's 2@H bid was fine, since she has a nice 6 card suit and a pretty good hand.  I think kia might just bid 3@H at this point. His singleton diamond is very nice, but he only has 2 trumps. Further, aggie might not have an opening hand, just a good heart suit. so I think 3@H is more prudent, although 4H might work.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N I can now count nine tricks, 2 spades, 2 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 2 clubs. so the question is, is the club finesse better, or should I play kia for the J of diamonds.  So I am going to try and find out.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, let me talk about squeezes. It's not that you should learn them, but you should understand the basic idea, because it is good declarer technique.  The basic idea is, if you only have one loser at most left in your hand, you should run all your tricks. Often it is hard for the opponents to discard, and you end up taking all the tricks.  So, even though a squeeze requires practice, if you just start taking all your tricks when you only have one loser left, sometimes you will perform a squeeze by default. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N So just try and remember that technique when you have one loser left.  And, for those interested, several of my puzzles involve squeezes. you can download them from my web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/#puzzles^*N. Now, one other point on the bidding.  I had a problem over moe's one spade bid. I have no good bid with my hand. 1N should promise at least a doubleton spade. 2@C should promise 5 good clubs or a six card suit. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N I had neither, so I had to decide which lie to tell. I thought 1N was closer to "the truth" than 2@C.  Note that I cannot bid 2@H, as that is a reverse, and I have a very weak opener. I had a clear opener, 12 HCP. 21 by the rule of 20. Just an awkward hand to bid if moe bids 1@S.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N On these sorts of hands, you can expect bad breaks.  So aggie might want to ruff moe's spade return high, at least if I am out, it will force out the K  and if she does, and ruffs my heart return high, she ends up making the hand.  However, the best thing about the hand was aggie's bidding. it was very good. I don't think 3@S makes, because kia has so many spades, but in general, the spades will be split more evenly, and 4@D will be a good result.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The reason aggie can be so aggressive is her void in spades is really powerful, once moe shows a long spade suit. Shortness in the opponents suit is very powerful, and should make you upgrade your hand.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N So, aggie's pass worked out very well. They might make 3N, but at this vulnerability, down 3 doubled is a much better result. Now, why did I bid 3@H? Though it didn't work on this hand, it will work more often than not, and many players would not pass aggie's hand. I know we have a 9 card fit, so it is usually right to "further the preempt" with 3 card support, and a bad hand, by bidding 3@H|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N First off, some players would bid 3@S with kia's hand, not double.  In fact, that is what I would have chosen. And 2nd, some players with aggie's hand would be afraid to leave it in, and would bid either 3N or 4@C. However, on this hand, both aggie and kia made very good decisions, and we got punished.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N To answer the question about disciplined preempts, in general, I open almost every 5-10 pt hand with a six card suit a weak two. In general I find it works out well.  This hand is an exception, but even so, it took two difficult decisions by the opponents to get it right. I bet most pairs would not end up in 3@H doubled.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N kia should not bid 2@S with his hand. I asked him to do an undo. Once he bids Stayman, and denies heart support, he has to have spades.  Therefore, there is no need to bid 2@S.  |

^*Bhondo717:^*N I have no good lead here, since I know kia has spades, and aggie has hearts. but will lead a spade anyway, as that seems like the best of a bad choice.  Since I can see all 4 hands, I know what the best lead really is (@D), but I would lead what I would have lead in regular table.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Good play aggie. When running a long suit, play the honors from the short hand first. That way, you won't be blocked from the long suit. If aggie had played the ace first, she would have no way to get back to her long clubs. This way aggie can play the Q, then the ace, and the 2 little clubs. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Well played aggie. Now, a couple of other bidding points here. First, I agree with aggie opening 1N even though she has a 5 card major.  It is difficult to show 15-17 point hands, and 1N is so descriptive, that most experts agree you can do it with a 5 card major.  2nd, moe should consider a 2@D bid.  It is likely I will be on lead, and, if nothing else, it gives me a lead directional bid.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


PF|Y|NT|^B@2 
The lead directional aspect is the most important reason on this hand. you don't really expect them to let you play it there.

@D@D As you know you can play this hand double dummy before clicking the forward arrow.   Lead a Diamond!!!!|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N My recommendation in general is that with 5 card support and less than a limit raise, you jump to 4 of the major on most any hand (even with 0 points). On more hands than not it will work out well, as it makes it very difficult for the opponents to find their game if they have one, and it will make more often than you might think. There are very few hands where you go down significantly and the opponents are unable to make some contract. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The reason I said "less than a limit raise" is only because you might miss slam. If you have a limit raise or better with 5 card support, you will virtually always make game against any sort of opener. Therefore, with a limit raise, you should find some forcing bid (if you play Bergen, you can make the limit raise bid or 3@C/3@D, and raise 3 spades to 4; if not, you have to bid a new suit). With a forcing raise, you can still bid 2N.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at|  

                                   
2nd hand low is rarely wrong, even when it seems so. You have to get in the habit of thinking, "I must have a very good reason NOT to play 2nd hand low."

Never be afraid to make declarer ruff. at worst, it is a safe play, and often it makes him run out of trumps prematurely.

It is not right to give declarer a ruff and sluf. So, if both dummy and declarer are out of a suit, you should not play it.

One level bids are forcing over a takeout double.

Shortness in the opponents suit is very powerful, and should make you upgrade your hand.

When running a long suit, play the honors from the short hand first. That way, you won't be blocked from the long suit.
