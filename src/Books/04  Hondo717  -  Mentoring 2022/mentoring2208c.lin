PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, you should be aware of the following fact about 3rd seat openers. In general, after 2 passes, the average number of HCP between 1st and 2nd seat is around 16 which means the average number of HCP between 3rd and 4th seat is 25. North has 4 points.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, East is likely to be very strong, 20 or so (which as you will see is true). That is another reason why I would open 2@D with the North hand, though, as I said most would pass.|
