nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you have a weak hand with a 6-card suit, you are almost always better off playing in your long suit. You occasionally will miss a 4-4 major suit fit which is acceptable. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|More often if you don't preempt the opponents will have more accurate bidding. So the rare risk of missing a major suit fit is more than offset by the reward behind preempting.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|MB|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule when partner preempts is to use the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| to determine whether or not to raise.

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand was a bit hard to plan. What West should do is, after winning the 3rd heart ruff, take the club finesse immediately. And then will end up making 4 because of the lucky club split.|
