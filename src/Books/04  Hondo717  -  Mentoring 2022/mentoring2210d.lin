mb|P|mb|1D|mb|D|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1N by North is incorrect, but I will not give an undo. Over a double 1N usually is a little stronger at least a good 7 and preferably 8 to 10. Further, North could bid 1@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically over a double you are no longer obligated to bid. You should do so if you have something to say but you can pass if you are weakish. I probably bid 1@H with North hand with pass as another reasonable choice.|

PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, although 2@S is fine, 3@S is another possibility which shows around 20. The main argument against 3@S is flat distribution.|
