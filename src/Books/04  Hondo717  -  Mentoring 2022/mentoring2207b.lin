up|29|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Someone asked me a question about opening a weak-2 bid with a 4-card major. Although there are many players who will not open a weak 2 with an outside 4 card major I completely disagree. Preempts are very powerful weapons and should be used whenever possible.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Odds are very much that with a weak hand and a 6-card suit, your best contract will be in your long suit. You might occasionally miss a 4-4 major which is not a big loss.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you pass, the opponents get a chance to enter the auction and you give them a big advantage to which they should not be entitled.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also,  another Kib asked me, is there a minimum honor holding for a preempt. Personally I will open a weak 2 even with a weak 6 card suit. 6-card suits are powerful even if weak because you will normally have an 8 or 9 card fit and will often take at least 4 tricks in your suit even if it is weak.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, others prefer to have some honors. Actually the ideal holding for a suit in which you preempt is QJ10 because you have some protection against losing too many tricks but you have no offense.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, although it sounds counter-intuitive, you actually prefer to balance with a weaker hand than a stronger hand. That is because the points are approximately evenly divided between the 2 sides and the NT opener has most of the points for his side.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, it is to your advantage in balancing seat if partner has more of your side's points, because then most of his finesses will be working.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, when you balance you are bidding the entirety of your side's assets, not just your hand. So the weaker you are, the stronger partner is and his points are better positioned.|

PG| ***** 66 ***** |


mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with 4@S. However, I think North should have bid 4@S over 1@H. It is better tactics and makes it harder for the opponents to communicate. It is true that we might have slam if I have the right hand though, given the opening bid, it is unlikely.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So personally I just bid 4@S figuring that is likely to be our best spot and puts maximum pressure on the opponents. Of course, some of that is just style.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a clear pass rather than 5@H. 5@H is what I call a ^*BRedundant Bid^*N. East already showed a limit raise with 2@S. His hand did not get any better after the auction, Therefore, there is no reason to bid 5@H.|

up|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5 level decisions in a competitive auction are probably the most difficult decisions to make. One mistake that most players make is too often they bid "5 over 5" that means they bid to a 5 level contract after the opponents have bid to a 5 level contract.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although that can be right on occasion most of the time it is wrong. There is a bridge saying "^*BThe 5 level belongs to the opponents^*N" meaning it is usually wrong to bid 5 over 5. But this hand was slightly different because from West's perspective the opponents were at the 4 level. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if West bid 5@H he would be bidding ^*B5 over 4^*N. That is a much more difficult decision. With 5-5 I would tend to bid that. However, the spades holding is a red flag as at least 2 spade losers are quite possible. Had West had a singleton spade, I would choose 5 hearts but with a doubleton, I think pass was best.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another issue which I did not address during the bidding is whether East should double. The answer is yes. If partner opens, as a general rule, you can count on him for 2 tricks. So with 2 aces, East has 2 likely tricks and therefore, it is likely North is going down. Therefore, double by East would be a reasonable choice.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All of this discussion is just general principles because when you get to competitive auctions with distributional hands, you never know for sure what is going to be correct. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you rely on the principles I just discussed (5 level belongs to the opponent, opener has 2 defensive tricks) you will make the correct decision more often than not.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If EW were playing what is known as "^*Bcoded tens and nines^*N", East would have led the H9. If you play that system, leading jack shows J10 and denies a higher honor. Leading the 10, shows either nothing higher or, more frequently, the KJ10 or AJ10. And if you lead the 9, similarly it shows either nothing higher, or more frequently, the A109, K109, or Q109. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Usually you only play that in NT and the main advantage is that when partner leads the jack, you know they have nothing higher. And when they lead the 10 or 9, they usually have something higher and you can often figure out what their exact holding is.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a reasonable auction. The alternatives for West was to play Texas Transfer. If West decides he wants to play in spades no matter what, which is reasonable and is not interested in slam he should bid 4@H, Texas Transfer, which is a transfer to spades.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way West bid it transferring to the 2 level and then bid 4@S over 2@S is a mild slam try. Frankly, with East's hand, I would be interested in slam with 4 key cards.|
