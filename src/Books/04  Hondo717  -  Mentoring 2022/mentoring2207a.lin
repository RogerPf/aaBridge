The problem with bidding 1NT is it tends to deny 4 spades and you might miss a 4-4 spade fit. 2@H is probably not as good although sometimes you raise with 3, but usually you have a more unbalanced hand. So I suggest East bids 1@S.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid 3@C if I were West since West knows they only have a 7 card heart fit and an 8 or 9 card club fit. 3@C rates to be better than 2@H even though it is 1 level higher.|
