That leaves 13 HCP between West and East. And since East has at least 11, the most West can have is 2. That is why the club finesse is marked and the heart finesse is likely to work. As declarer and defender you should learn to do so.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then North needs to add 3 length points, plus 2 points each for the two doubletons for a total of 4--although the club singleton is not wonderful, 1 point for the side 4-card diamond suit, and 2 points for the 6th and 7th spade once we have a fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you have an 8 card suit, missing honors is not as important. Let me explain. The other 3 hands have 5 diamonds between them. On average your partner will have 1.67 diamonds. That means you have a 10 card fit likely. You will take six diamond trick even if missing the @DA and @DK.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, the longer your suit, the less you have to worry about having top honors. In general you should worry more about length of the suit than its strength when preempting.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you jump to the 4 level over Jacoby 2N that shows a 5 card suit with 2 of the top 3. The reason for that bidding is it is a nice source of tricks and might allow you to get to 7 if partner has an appropriate hand and can count 13 tricks.|

mb|4D|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@D is not what West wants to hear. It is possible they have 2 heart losers. However, as West I still would bid 4N and hope for the best because slam is still very possible.|

mb|4N|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East has another unusual response. The 5@H bid shows 2 key cards without the @SQ which technically is what East has. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, because East has 6 spades and knows they have a 10 card fit meaning spades are likely to break 2-1. Therefore, the lack of the @SQ doesn't matter, since it will come down in 2 rounds at worst. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East should respond 5@S which normally shows 2 key cards and the @SQ. But sometimes shows 2 key cards and a known 10+ card fit as the 10 card fit is equivalent to holding the @SQ.|

pc|CK|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I can count 5 hearts, 2 spades, 2 clubs, and 2 diamonds for 11 tricks. So this is a very easy hand to play. I draw trump, knock out my 2 losers and claim. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should always plan the hand at trick 1 because often it is not easy and sometimes the correct play at trick 1 is crucial. It is a very good habit for you to get into. |
