up|37|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me explain why a low spade was a good play. East held the Qx of diamonds. Presumably North had Axxxx in diamonds. Therefore, the diamond Qx is probably not going to take a trick. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, East has to hope that West has the @DJ in which case, East wants West to ruff with the @DJ in the hopes that declarer will guess the diamonds wrong and play for the 1-1- break.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Had East played a high spade, no reason for West to ruff but East wants West to ruff. That is a very sophisticated defensive maneuver that only experts would find, but I wanted to illustrate it here. Declarer happened to guess here the best way to play diamonds. But note that absent the ruff with the @DJ, declarer would have no guess and would never lose any diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the reason I bid 4@D was because it does meet the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| meaning 10 trick contract with 10 card fit.|

PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, it was likely the right bid regardless. I do not think North should bid 5. The @SQ seems worthless. With no singletons or voids and only 10 working HCP, pass by North was best. Although, given the auction, where East is likely to have the @HK, 5@D is not a bad bid.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NIs it possible that North had 4 diamonds and 4 clubs?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is very unlikely that North has 4 diamonds and 4 spades. In that case, North would either rebid 1NT or raise to 2@H with 3-card support. The 2C rebid pretty much guarantees that North started with 5+ diamonds.|

ub||mb|1N|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss West's options over 1N. If West only bids 2@H, that shows a weak hand and asks East to pass or correct to 2@S. West's hand is too strong to bid 2H with 10 HCP and two 5-card suits. If partner has 4 hearts or 3 spades, game is very possible, and if not, 2NT should have plays. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West could bid 3@H, which is game forcing and presumably shows 5-5 in the majors.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is because |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Bergen Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at| are really used by the hand with the long trump as most of the time the hand with more length in the trump suit is declarer. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in this case, although West is dummy they still have the longer trump length so they should use declarer points. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 10 HCP, 1 for spade length, 1 for heart length, 2 for singleton, and 1 for side 4+ card spade suit for 15 points. Normally you would deduct one for @DQ singleton, but since East opened 1@D you should not do that. The total is 14 points after deducting one for Jx of clubs. That is enough to bid game. So West should bid game (4@H).|

So, although most would pass, let's have East make a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| balancing bid. East can bid 2@C, showing clubs and another suit, at least 5-4.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a very good idea to play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| over 1N, and to balance in the pass out seat when it goes 1N-P-P if you are 5-4 or have a 6-card suit.|

mb|1D|mb|P|mb|1H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@H is possible with the West hand. However, since West's hand meets the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at| I would bid 2@C to establish a game force playing 2/1. That does not deny a 4-card major.|

pc|DK|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a reasonable lead, despite the 1@D opening. In general you don't want to lead a suit the opponents have bid. However, North has no better suit to lead. Further, The @DK tells me to signal with the A or J.|
