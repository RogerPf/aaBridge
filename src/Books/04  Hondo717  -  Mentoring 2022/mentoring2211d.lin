up|45|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure what happens if North bids 2@H. We take 4 hearts, 2 spades and 2 clubs for sure. We might make more tricks. BTW, opening a preemptive 2@S by North is reasonable. Granted we might miss a heart fit (and in fact we would).|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, North knows that East is strong because you can use the following the ^*BRule of 24^*N in 3rd seat With two passes and you are in 3rd seat, on average the first 2 players have around 16 HCP.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means 3rd and 4th seat have a combined 24 HCP. North has 9 HCP. Therefore, East is likely to have around 15. That is a good case to preempt and bid 2@S. Admittedly, you might miss a heart fit.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, here, 1@S in 3rd seat is reasonable, especially because you can compete in both majors unless you are very conservative bridge player.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a matter of opinion as to whether or not it is better than |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at|. Basically, the main difference between Meckwell and |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| is the 2@H bid in Meckwell shows a single suited heart hand.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One could argue that |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| is better because of frequency though it is unclear, and either is fine.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The standard bid for East would be 3@S which is |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=stayman,Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at|. 2N would tend to show a spade stopper and an invitational hand.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, let me teach how it works on this particular hand, although I won't get into all the details. If East bids 3@S immediately, that is a game forcing hand and is |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=stayman,Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| with no spade stopper. East he doesn't quite have a game forcing hand, but close enough. So playing |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lebensohl,LEBENSOHL^*N|CP||FP||at| I would bid 3@S. If East wanted to bid |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=stayman,Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| and had a spade stopper. East would bid 2N, which is artificial. It forces partner to bid 3@C. On this particular hand, if East then bid 3@S, that would be |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=stayman,Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| but would also show a spade stopper.

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some won't open a Weak-2 with an outside 4 card major. However, I think that is a very silly way to play because you want to preempt as much as you can. And when you have a 6-card suit, the most likely trump suit you want to play in is your 6-card suit.|
