mb|P|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H with East's hand is a reasonable call. In 1st seat I might open 3@H despite the weak hearts and in 3rd seat I almost always open 3@H. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in 2nd seat there is more chance you are preempting partner. Therefore, in 2nd seat you want to be a little less aggressive in preempting. You still should preempt if you can, but it should be closer to a standard preempt.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With perfect defense we might take another trick or perhaps two. At trick two it was hard for North to know to play the @HQ on the @HJ. Has North done so, we might end up taking a diamond in addition to the 3 heart tricks.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether or not I should bid over 2@H, if I had one more point I might try 2N. Some might bid 2@S. However, with such a bad suit, and more than half my points in the opponents' suit, and a passed partner we had more to lose than gain. And as you can see, 2@S is awful.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D might work out. I would definitely have opened a weak 2@D bid with the North hand. If North opens 2@D, we might end up competing. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North propably thought the suit was not good enough. In actual fact, often a weaker suit, especially one with intermediates is actually better to preempt with than a stronger suit because with a weak suit you have no defense but more offense.

mb|P|mb|1C|mb|2D|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double by North was best. North is a bit weak but has perfect distribution. And even if I bid 3@C, that should work out okay. After a preempt you often don't have the perfect bid, so you make the best of imperfect choices. That's why you preempt, to make the opponents have to make imperfect choices.|

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if I lose the spade, there is a good chance I also lose a diamond, 3 clubs, and a heart and go down 1. Another very unlikely chance is that the @CAK are on my left and at this point that is my only legitimate chance because even if I play for 3-3 hearts I would end up going down one if I lose 3 club tricks. So rather lucky to make 2@S.|

up|52|up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this sort of auction, a trump lead is often right. Whenever declarer bids 2 suits and dummy shows a preference for one, especially declarer's 2nd suit that typically means dummy is short in declarer's other suit and a trump lead will cut down on ruffs. That certainly would have helped here. I might only end up taking 9 tricks on a trump lead.|
