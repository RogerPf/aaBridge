mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1N is what most would open and is very reasonable. However, an expert would upgrade the hand to 18 because of the wonderful clubs and bid 1@C, intending to rebid 2N to show 18-19.|

mb|2H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am bidding |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| here. A suit bid in |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| shows that suit and a higher suit, at least 5-4. So my 2@H bid here specifically shows hearts and spades. It may not work out particularly well here, but it does most of the time. Normally, partner passes with better hearts and bids 2@S with better spades.|
