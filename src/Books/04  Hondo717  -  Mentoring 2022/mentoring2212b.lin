up|28|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very unlucky hand for declarer. However, the hand was  misplayed. On this particular hand, so long as spades are no worse than 3-1, the best way to play the hand, after winning trick 1, is to lead a spade to the @SA at trick 2, and then a low spade. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That ensures that, at worst, declarer will lose 2 spades and a diamond. What declarer needs to guard against is the defenders scoring lots of trump tricks via ruffs, which is exactly what happened when declarer did not immediately try to draw 2 rounds of trump.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent any inferences from the bidding, the best way to play the trump suit 109xxx opposite AQxx is to play the ace first and hope an honor drops. If it does, at most you will lose one trump trick. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If no honor drops, then you enter your hand and lead towards the Q. That will result in one loser any time trumps are 2-2 or South has KJx of trump. If North has KJx of trump, you have 2 losers no matter what.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They play that as ^*BPre-competing^*n meaning they assume, when they have less than invitational values that the points are evenly split, and good opponents will not let them play in 2@S. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if they are going to bid 3@S over whatever the opponents compete with then they bid it rightaway to prevent the opponents from competing. Therefore, East needs to make some other bid to invite game. Usually you bid a suit with an honor. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, here I would bid 3@D. Of course, as it turns out, game in spades is not making. However, that is because they have a bad fit--3 hearts opposite 3 hearts.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, the question is, should West go to 4@S. The @CJ could easily be valuable given the 1@C bid by West. However, admittedly the @HJ is worthless given the 1@H overcall by North.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it is, despite the bad fit it is not hopeless. If both the diamond finesse and spade finesse work, it makes although admittedly not odds on.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 13 HCP, one for quality spades, an a bad 4-3-3-3 distribution. In IMPs I bid 4 but in Match Points I pass. Having said that, even 3@S goes down. However, if you make every game that you bid, you are not bidding enough. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You would go down in close to half of the marginal games that you bid because even when that happens in the long run you come out ahead particularly in IMPs. In fact, in IMPs, you bid 40% games to break even. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, if NS compete, then West can use LOTT to bid 3S.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you follow my guideline, then it would not be wrong for North to bid 3@S over 3@H although at this vulnerability it is a bit risky. And 3@S does not make. Depending on how the spade suit is played it might be down 2.|

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass by East is very reasonable. Using Bergen hand evaluation, East's hand is only 10 points and does not meet the rule of 20. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|From the raw 12 HCP you deduct one point for the KQ doubleton in hearts and one point for rule of ^*BAdjust-3^*N--four queens/jacks and only one ace/ten. based on Bergen hand evaluation, you deduct one point if the number of queens/jacks exceeds the number of aces/tens by 3 or more.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reasoning behind this rule is the A = 4, K = 3, Q = 2, and J = 1 high card point rule is not completely accurate. It turns out that if you use computer analysis aces are worth more than 4, queens and jacks are worth less than 2 and 1 respectly, and tens have a little bit of value. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, rather than using fractional values for counting HCP which is very difficult, Bergen approximates the slight inaccuracies in HCP by using the rule of ^*BAdjust-3^*N where you deduct a point if you have many more queens and jacks than aces and tens and vice versa add a point if you have many more aces and tens than queens and jacks. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen calls that rule of ^*BAdjust-3^*N and you can read about it in my Bergen hand evaluation lesson.|

pc|H8|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with that lead. North should not lead a spade because East bid them. So an unbid major is often a good lead. Unfortunately, that gives away a trick, but it is still the correct play.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are several ways to play that hand. and if West guesses the club situation it does make. My guess is that at a duplicate game, about half would make 2N and half would go down.|
