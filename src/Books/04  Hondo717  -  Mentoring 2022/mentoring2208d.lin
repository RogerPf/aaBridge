nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a convention called ^*BEqual Level Conversion - ELC^*n which works well with this hand.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, if I doubled, and pulled a 2@C response to 2@D, that would be a ^*B"double and correct"^*n showing a strong hand with nice diamonds.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you play ELC, if partner bids 2@C and I bid 2@D, that is ^*B"converting to an equal level"^*n and just means I have diamonds and hearts but not clubs. ELC only works if you don't have clubs (or you don't have diamonds if the opponent opens 1@C).|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The theory is double and correct is rare, so ELC lets you double with more hands. Here we will just play normal takeout doubles.|

mb|1S2D?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I suggest East bids support doubles. If you play those, then on this hand East would double 2@D to show 3-card spade support. If you don't there still is a case for East to bid 2@S, although, you prefer not to raise with 3-card support, but sometimes it is the best bid. Absent a support double I wouldn't pass.
