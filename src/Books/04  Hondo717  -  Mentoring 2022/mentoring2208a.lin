up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The horrible diamond break is why East took so few tricks. 2@D is not a terrible rebid.

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite only having the worthless @DJ, I liked North's raise to 3@H. North did not make a negative double over 2@D so North cannot be that strong. Admittedly North is somewhat weaker than South would expect but 3@H is a good competitive bid. I will often have a 5-card suit on that auction meaning we could have a 10-card fit. And we have at least a 9-card fit, so the 3@H bid follows the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at||

mb|3D|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the 3@D bid despite the 4-card major. You should strain to preempt and not look for excuses not to. Preempts work well most of the time.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I have a problem as to what to bid. You should tend to favor a major when partner makes a takeout double. However, I have a very weak major and it is quite possible partner only has 3 card support. On the other hand, 4@C by me takes us one level higher, and partner might have been stuck for a bid and not have clubs.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, it bypasses 3N although given my diamond holding, 3N is not likely to make. I mean 3N is not likely to be bid. Even if you play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttps://www.bridgehands.com/L/Lebensohl.htm,Lebensohl (external link)^*N|CP||FP||at| after a double of a weak 2 bid (which I don't care for myself), it does not apply over a 3 level preempt. 3NT by me over the double would be to play.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So as you can see, the preempt worked out very well, as it often does. We should obviously be in clubs. We would have ended up in clubs had West passed.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think I made the correct decision in theory, but in practice 4@C would obviously have worked out better.
