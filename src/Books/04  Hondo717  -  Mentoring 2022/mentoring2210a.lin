To respond, the modern tendency is to bypass diamonds when you have a 4-card major. However, I think something slightly more nuanced is better. You should bid diamonds if you intend to take a second rebid. However, as on this hand, if you only have one sure bid, you should bid your major and bypass diamonds.|

mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree that you should open 1N with a 5-card major and a balanced hand. And these days, 1NT is opened on many hands with more than one doubleton. I would not open 1NT with the West hand personally, although it is certainly an alternative. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason is, the hearts are very good and the hand has 2 doubletons. But as I said, 1N is certainly a reasonable alternative and it is going to work out fine as it turns out.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I might lead a club here because dummy looks very formidable. But I happen to know that West has at least 4 clubs. Based on the lead, I know West has 3 hearts (assuming partner has 4) and based on the bidding, I know West has at most 3 spades since they did not raise spades. Therefore, West has to have at least 4 clubs. So I will just lead a heart and hope we can take 3 heart tricks.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is important to note the analysis I went through in trying to figure out what declarer held. If you can learn to do that, you will become a much better defender. However, it is very hard and takes lots of practice.|

mb|P|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some would open North's hand 1@D because technically, not using |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenhandevaluation,Bergen Hand Evaluation^*N|CP||FP||at|, the hand meets the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at|. On the other hand, 3 queens are not really worth 6 points and two Qxs are definitely a downgrade. Therefore, I think 2@D is much better than 1@D.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. West did well to pass. Some might bid 2@S or even 2N because East can be relatively strong. Personally I probably bid 2@S, and they probably end up in 2N which is much harder to play than 2@H. So West was smarter than the teacher on that hand.|
