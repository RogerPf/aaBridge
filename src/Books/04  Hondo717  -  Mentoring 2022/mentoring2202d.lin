That is 100% wrong whether playing 2/1 (which we are) or not. Whenever you have 5 clubs and 4 spades and a game forcing hand, you must bid 2@C. You won't lose your spade fit because with 4 spades partner will bid 2@S over 2@C.|

It merely shows that East has a balanced hand (not 6 hearts, not 4 spades, not 4 diamonds). Even lacking stoppers in 1 suit you still bid 2N.|

The singleton vastly improves the North hand. Even discounting the the @CJ, North has 9 HCP and 1 length point. Plus the @HK is well placed after the 1@H opener.
