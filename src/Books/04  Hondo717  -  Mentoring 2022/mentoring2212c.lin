But with the North hand, I think 1@S is the better opening bid. With 5-4 in the majors it is more likely you want to play in a major suit fit.|

However, 2@C over 1@D is often a good bid, as it makes it harder for the opponents to find a major suit fit. It is somewhat preemptive so you should strain to bid it.|
