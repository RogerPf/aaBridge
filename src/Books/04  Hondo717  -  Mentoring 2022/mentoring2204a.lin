UP|52|up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of things to note on my bidding. Although most open 1@D with 4-4 in the minors, I tend to like to open 1@C to conserve space. Also, I had no perfect rebid over 1@H. So I chose an imperfect 2N to at least describe my strength and 4S is a decent contract.|

No. I^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. It normally just shows fewer hearts.|
