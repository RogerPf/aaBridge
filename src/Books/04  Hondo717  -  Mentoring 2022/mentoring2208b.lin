If club finesse wins and clubs behave, that eliminates 1 loser. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, 2N is around 11 points. However, I wouldn't have bid it because the @SJ might be dubious, only have 2 hearts, and partner does not have to have opening values. But 2N is certainly a reasonable alternative and worked out for us on this deal

Hands with long suits and voids are wonderful and are worth much more than their HCP. In fact, if not vulnerable, I would consider opening 3@S. Here, though, 2@S is very clear.|

If West has as little as the Kxxx of diamonds, then their side can take 4 diamond tricks, 1 club trick, 3 hearts, and 1 spade making make 3N.|
