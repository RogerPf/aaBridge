mb|P|mb|1C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|1H|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has a bit of a problem. 2@C is not a bad choice and probably best. West theoretically does have 10 HCP and 2 doubletons and 2@C typically shows 6-9 in competition (even if you normally play inverted raises where 2@C shows 10+) because inverted raises are off in competiont. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2@C is a slight underbid because West's |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at| are 11 HCP, + 1 length point, - 1 for Jx in hearts, -1 for dubious SQJ, and + 2 for both doubletons for 12 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at|. I might bid either 2@D or 2@H (cue bid showing a limit raise) but 2@C is reasonable if conservative.|

mb|3C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North must follow the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at|. Since I have 5 hearts and North has 4, we have a 9 card fit which means that a 9 trick contract (3 level) is reasonable. |

PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So at the very least North should bid 3@H. Having said that, North actually has a very nice hand. It is worth 9 HCP + 3 for the singleton with 4-card support for 12 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at|. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it is worth a limit raise. Therefore, I think North's best bid is 3@C--a cuebid of opponent's suit.. And 2@H is definitely wrong both on length and strength. At the very least use the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| in competition.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 8 HCP + 1 length points + 2 points for the singleton + 1 point for the 4-card side diamond  It is worth 12 declarer points but not quite enough to bid game (since partner has 10-12 given the original pass).|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, had partner not been a passed hand, the 3@C bid shows 10+ but no upper limit. However, since North originally passed, North cannot have more than 12 or so. Anyway, bottom line is I bid 3@H.|

PG| ***** 33 ***** |


mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A very nice bid by East. There is another very important competitive bidding principle that many less experienced players are not aware of. That is, you should bid 4@S over 4@H if you have a 9+ card spade fit, regardless of strength. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is either a good bid or a good sacrifice. On rare occasions, if you are vul and they are not and if you have a flat hand (e.g. no singletons or voids) you might not do it. But even then it is often right. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you always do it, you will be right more often than not. And if you do it confidently (e.g. no hesitation) you will often talk the opponents into bidding 5@H when they are not vul and you are vul.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is another principle called the "forcing pass" principle. When your side has bid to game in a constructive auction (e.g. you bid game because you think it is going to make, as opposed to a sacrifice), you cannot let the opponents sacrifice without either doubling or bidding higher. |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if the forcing pass principle were to apply to this auction, if I pass, partner must either bid 5@H or double 4@S.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, in this auction, it is not clear that we were making the 4@H. So it is not clear after my pass that partner should double or bid 5@H. However, with 2 aces, I probably double 4@S particularly in Match Points.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5 level decisions are very difficult. So if North chose to pass I would not say that was wrong in IMPs but I would double.|

PG| ***** 55 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is one of the toughest decisions in bridge. As a general rule the principle "the 5 level belongs to the opponents" is a good one. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means, if the opponents are at the 5 level already, you should not bid 5 over 5, unless you have a very good reason such as you have a void in their suit or an 11 card fit. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, bidding 5 over 4@S is much harder. In this particular case, since I only overcalled so might be relatively weak and North probably should not bid 5@H though it is not clear.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 4@H, we will take 5 heart tricks, 1 spade trick, 1 club trick, 1 diamond trick, and 2 ruffs in dummy for 10 tricks. So 4@S over 4@H worked out well. |

up|47|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have one minor comment on how the hand was played. Because North happened to guess spades directly they made 11 tricks. But a better line to guarantee 11 tricks is to knock out the @CA and @CK. That guarantees 11 tricks without having to guess spades. |

These days I tend to open 2N with 19 HCP and a 5 card suit though most would open the hand 1@C. Here, North can open 2N which is fine.|

I only have 4 no so great HCP (Queen and Jacks). However, I love my 6 card suit which gives me 2 length points. That should be enough for us to be in game.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, 4@S would be a good sacrifice for EW. However, there is no way for them to find it. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, the best way for North to play the hand is to play the @HA, then a low heart, and then take the club finesse and hope it works or that clubs are 3-3, or that the diamond finesse works in which case the hand makes.|
