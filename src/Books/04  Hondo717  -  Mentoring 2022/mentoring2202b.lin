cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most often bidding Texas transfer shows a hand with a 6-card suit and game values. However, on occasion, responder will bid it with a 6-card suit and possible slam values. If that is the case, then responder will bid RKCB over the forced response by opener. However, most of the time, as on this hand, responder will pass.|
