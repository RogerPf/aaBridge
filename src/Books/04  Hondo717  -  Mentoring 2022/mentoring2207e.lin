mb|1C|mb|D|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double was a bit light but not terrible. The response to a takeout double depends on the hand's strength. With 0-8 or so, you just bid your suit at the cheapest level. With 9-11 you jump in your suit to show an invitational hand, and with 12 plus, you cue bid the opponents suit which simply establishes a game force. Since West has a game force, she would cue bid 2@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West could have bid 4@S. However, that has two potential problems. First, in the rare instance that the double was double and correct, it is barely possible East does not have spades, although admittedly very unlikely. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if West were weaker, passing 2@C would be okay since West would not want to encourage. But with 10 HCP and 5 spades, 2@D leaves some more possibilities.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, East could have as much as 16 or 17 points (not quite enough to jump shift) and East might have 3 spades (if 3-1-5-4). So 2@D caters to all those possibilities. Having said that, passing 2@C is likely to work out.|

pc|S6s2|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have to think about what North might have in terms of spades. I can't see the @SJ, @S7, or @S3. It is possible North has a singleton spade.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unlikely North started with @J76 of spades because a) West would not play low with a singleton spade, b) that is a strange lead, and c) it does make it more likely it is a singleton after the weak-2 bid. So the most likely scenarios are North either has a singleton or doubleton spade. In either case playing the ace should be fine.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A high spade spot means I want the higher suit led back (diamonds in this case). A low spade spot means I want clubs led back (clubs in this case). I am leading the 10 which means I want partner to lead back diamonds.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it is hard to pass with 13 points and many players would bid with the East hand, after 2@D, sometimes you have to pass. Note that if East passes, we end up in 2@D which does very poorly.

mb|1D|mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with the 2@C bid by North. Some might bid 1N. In general, it is a good idea to overcall 1NT whenever you have a suitable hand, and North certainly has a suitable 1N overcall. However, on this hand, EW have shown they have at least close to half the HCP, meaning North knows South must be weak. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 2@C overcall has some advantages. Given South's known weak hand, 1N is more likely to go down than 2@C. And 2@C might allow South to compete in clubs (which, as we will see, is exactly what happened).|

pc|H9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A heart is a reasonable lead, Usually, you don't like to lead away from kings. However, but no other lead seems attractive. In this board, the other choice is the @CA. I normally do not to lead unprotected aces. But in this case, I might do it because partner supported.|
