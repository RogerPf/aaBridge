mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some of you might be wondering why East did not bid 4@C because of the singleton club. Let me explain why that is not correct on this particular auction. In general when you control bid, you are indeed showing 1st or 2nd round control. That in general can be an ace, king, singleton, or void. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West not bid 2@C to start with, then the correct control bid for East would in fact be 4@C because of the singleton which is 2nd round control. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if partner has bid a suit, you only control bid aces and kings, not shortness because shortness is not useful in partner's suit. So on this auction 4@D is the correct bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to play 1430. It is just an artifact. When spades are trump it doesn't matter. However, if clubs or diamonds are trump, particularly clubs, you want to be able to bid 5@C with 0 so you can stop in 5@C.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason 1430 was invented was very flawed and there is no real advantage to 1430. Unfortunately, most still unfortunately play 1430 using esoteric claims.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |

ht|b|CS|1|CP|4|fp|1|at|^-{      The Flawed Reasoning Behind 1430      }
^-|CS||CP||fp||ht|d|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With regular blackwood, the response to show zero aces is 5@C and the response to show one ace 5@D. And if you play 0314, you use those same responses. So why was 1430, where 5@C shows 1 key card and 5@D shows 0 key cards, invented? As you will see, the reasoning was flawed and only helps in one fairly rare specific case.

Suppose you bid 4NT RKCB when hearts are trump. If partner responds 5@C and you want to find out if he has the trump queen, you can bid 5@D. However if partner bids 5@D, in order to do the queen ask, you would have to bid 5@S (since if you bid 5@H that would be to play). That would commit you to playing slam whether or not partner holds the @HQ. But there are many hands where you do not want to be in slam unless partner has the @HQ.

So the thinking behind 1430 is as follows. You are more likely to want to do the queen ask if partner has 1 key card rather than 0 key cards. So if you define 5@C as showing 1 key card, you will be able to do the queen ask by bidding 5@D. Of course, when partner responds 5@D, you still have the same problem of not being able to do the queen ask without committing to slam.

So 1430 solves the problem of the queen ask when hearts are trump and partner has 1 (or 4) key cards. But it does not solve the problem when partner has 0 or 3 key cards. As you can see, the reasoning behind 1430 is shaky at best.

But if you choose to play Kickback RKCB, the entire queen ask problem is eliminated. And you can play the more logical 0314 responses.

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double dummy, if I cash the @HA and give partner a ruff we will beat the hand. So as is often the case, although we could beat it in theory, in practice it is very hard to defend perfectly. That is why aggressive bidding usually pays off even if you shouldn't make a contract, you often will.|

mb|1D|mb|P|mb|1S|mb|3C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C is an interesting bid. I am not sure I would make it because of flat hand, only 6 card suit, and strength particularly at this vulnerability, though it could work out really well.|

mb|3D?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem now is, should I bid 4@C? In general you avoid bidding "4 over 3", however, if partner has 7 clubs, as he often will (but not always these days) then since we have 10 clubs, the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| says I should bid 4@C. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, my flat hand is worth a downgrade plus I am not sure we have a 10 card fit. So in Match Points I bid 4@C, but in IMPs it doesn't pay off, particularly if they end up in 4 of a major making.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now partner, should be able to tell how many clubs East has. I led the 7 which is the lowest club North can see. Therefore, I have one or three. Dummy has 3. North has 6. So there are 2 clubs remaining between East and South.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, either I started with a singleton or I started with 3 with 3 being more likely. So playing another club can't hurt. This is the kind of analysis and counting you should get in the habit of doing.|
