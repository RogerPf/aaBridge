Even with some 2-2-5-4 hands North might bid 1N. Further, the point count is a bit ambiguous. North could have as little as 12 or as much as 16 or 17. Even at the upper end of the range, we probably don't have game.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, North could have 5 clubs. So, although we might be in a 4-3 fit, with such nice club support, I think pass is best, particularly, although I know we have a 5-2 diamond fit, my diamonds are so weak.|

However, the important point of this hand was to plan your declarer play and manage your entries. You plan the play by counting your winners and figuring out that diamond ruffs were not needed to make the hand.|
