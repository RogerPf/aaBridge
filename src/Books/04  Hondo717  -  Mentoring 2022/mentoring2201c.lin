mb|2D|mb|3D|mb|P|mb|3N|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N was a pretty reasonable call. Also, it is a tough hand to play.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


pc|D6|sk|n|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer should do a careful planning. North can count 1 diamond, 6 clubs, and 1 spade for eight tricks. So North needs a 9th trick.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North can figure out the diamonds distribution. East has 6 diamonds (bid 2@D), declarer and dummy have five diamonds. That means West has 2 diamonds and is the dangerous opponent.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, if North takes the first diamond trick and West ever gets in, probably with @HA, North is down. East/West get five diamonds and whatever card West gets in with.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hoping that East and not West has the @HA is very unlikely because then East which most likely has @DAK and @HA with a 6-card suit would probably open 1@D not 2@D.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North should place the @HA in West hand and duck the first diamond and let the West lead a diamond through. The opponents initially get three diamond tricks and when West gets in with @HA does not have a diamond to lead. And North's 9th trick is a diamond. Let us try it.|

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


sk||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the other choice is to hope East has the @HQ. If that is the case then North has to duck the first diamonds because when West gets in with the @HA, West won't have any diamonds to lead back.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East has to decide what to lead. If East plays a heart. West wins but does not have a diamond to lead back. Further, gives North two heart tricks which along wih six clubs and a sure diamond is all needed to make the contract.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is probable that East decides to play a spades which would defeat the contract. But it is very unlikely any East would find that play.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, the way North played it was just about guaranteed to go down. However, when North ducks the diamond and West returns a diamond then if East cashes a third diamond East has to shift to a spade at trick 4 in order to beat it  That is very hard to figure out.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To the invite many players would just bid 3@S. However, most experts play that 3@S in a competitive auction is NOT invitational. It is just competing (making it hard for West to bid again). Therefore, I will bid 3@D to show an invitational hand and some strength in diamonds (not necessarily a 4-card suit).|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So being aggressive didn't work out well here. Even had East just passed, -200 in Match Points would be a bad result not quite as bad in IMPs as they are making 3@S (140) so only a couple of IMPs.|

mb|3H?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to discuss a really nice convention that most people don't play but it works really well. Most people play a double by me is takeout. However, many experts play that double over a 3 level preempt is a stopper asking bid. It asks partner to bid 3N with a stopper in the preempters suit. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That works well here. Otherwise, I would have to bid 4@D and we might end up missing 3NT. I started playing it about a year ago and it has worked well. BTW, it is called a ^*BThrump Double^*N. I am not sure why it is named that, other than it is a contraction for 3NT. It is alertable.|
