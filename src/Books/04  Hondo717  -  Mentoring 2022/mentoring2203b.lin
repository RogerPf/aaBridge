mb|1D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think opening 1@D is reasonable. If using raw rule of 20, North has 12 HCP and 8 cards in diamonds/clubs (or hearts).

d) bid 3N with a maximum and neither major.|

pc|H7|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think leading 4th best from longest and strongest is best, although it is popular in many circles to lead top of nothing in unbid majors against NT. Sometimes it does give away a trick. So does leading top of nothing.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And top of nothing is pure guess. Whereas 4th best at least is attacking. Here 4th best diamond would have helped quite a bit. But it is not often right to lead a suit the opponents have bid. That is particularly true against suits and against NT. So, heart was very reasonable given the 1@D opener.|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 8 trump you should bid to an 8 trick contract (2 level). With 9 trump to the 3 level (9 trick contract). On this hand North knows we have at least 10 spades between our 2 hands. So North should bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North wanted to be a little conservative because of no singletons and unfavorable vulnerability (we are vul they are not) can bid 3@S. That is okay, although I would still bid 4@S. BTW, 2@S is 100% too conservative and 3@S in this auction is not a limit raise. If North wanted to make a limit raise, they would bid 3@C cue bid. A jump raise in a competitive auction is always preemtive.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have to guess how to play hearts. With this combination and w[th no information I would always lead low and play the @HJ. There is no particular reason for that to be right. It is just that if I am consistent I will be right 50% of the time. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with this board I do have some extra information. West overcalled and thus far has shown up with no points in spades, only the @CQ, and only the @DJ. So based on the information from bidding, I would be pretty sure (incorrectly as it turns out) that West holds the @HA. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West could easily hold the @HQ as well. Then if that is the case I am down regardless. So here, it is clear to play a low heart towards the @HJ. |

mb|P|mb|P|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D for North is fine, particularly in 3rd seat, where preempting even with slightly strong hands is a very good idea.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 10 actual HCP, less 1 for dubious Jx in clubs, plus 1 for quality (3 honor) diamond suit which comes to 10 Bergen HCP, and plus 10 cards in diamonds/hearts.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, technically North could open 1@D. And I might open 1@D in 1st or 2nd seat. However, in 3rd seat preempting is often a good idea because after 2 passes unless 3rd hand is very strong it is likely 4th hand is strong. So preempting is particularly effective.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players feel you should not open a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major. The theory being you might miss a major suit fit. I think that is incorrect. Preempting is a very effective bidding tool. You should strain to preempt.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general if you have a weak hand you don't want to bid constructively. You want to "destroy" the opponents auction. Therefore, the fact that you will rarely miss a major suit fit when you have a 4 card major is not very important or relevant.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now even if you play that you don't like to open weak 2 with a 4-card major, most players will open a weak 2 in 3rd seat with an outside 4-card major even if they do not in other seats because a 3rd seat preempt is the most effective.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss how to play a trump suit where you have 9 cards missing the queen. I know that most people think you should play for the drop of the queen.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us say East now plays another spade and I play a low spade. I have one less card now than my partner, because I have played to this trick and partner has not.

PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in reality it is a toss up. If you always want to finesse for the queen with a 9-card fit (assuming you play the A or K first to see if the queen is singleton) that works just as well. Plus, and this is important, you often have extra information from the auction.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you know one player has a 5+ card suit (e.g. opened 1 of a major or preempted) It is much more likely their partner has the queen, since their partner has more unknown cards. So you should definitely finesse against their partner if you can. Your finesse in that case has a much higher probability of working.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most recent theory for some is to open 1NT with less precise distributions (standard distributions) such as 5-4-2-2.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I agree with North not opening the hand 1N. I think 1NT is a very precise bid and if you start opening it with less precise distributions it makes it less effective.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, it probably would have worked out better if North had opened 1N. In that case, I would bid 3N ending the auction with little information to the opponents.|

I do have slight entry issues that nothing I can do about that. So, after winning this trick, I will start clubs and should be able to take 9 tricks.|
