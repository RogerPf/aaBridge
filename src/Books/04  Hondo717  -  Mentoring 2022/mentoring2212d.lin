nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of the reasons to prefer 1N to 3 of a minor is it is often much easier to take 7 tricks than 9 tricks. But many players are too eager to transfer to 3 of a minor.|

up|34|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss a couple of points on the bidding. First, and most importantly you should pretty much always bid 4@S over 4@H if you have a 9 card spade fit or more.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second, the rules for bidding "3 over 3" (e.g. 3@S over 3@H on this hand). You should only bid 3 over 3 if:
^Ca) you have a 9 card fit (e.g Law of Total Tricks) or
^Cb) you have a singleton, especially in their suit.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, West should not bid 3@S over 3@H but East should. Further, bidding 5 over 5 is normally not correct. Although it turns out EW can make 5@S if they correctly guess how to play the spade suit, it is very lucky that it makes. EW could easily lose 2 diamonds, 1 club, and 1 spade and even be down in 4 spades. 5@H doubled is the correct place to play.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other interesting question is what should North bid over 1@S. I don't bid 2@H because of the weak hearts but I do love the hand.North's choices are either 2@D, 3@D, 2@S (Michaels) or even 4@D which is just a diamond preempt.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And finally, with such nice diamonds, and the fact that they can bid spades over hearts, the likelihood is you want to play in diamonds and not worry about the hearts. If the hearts were stronger then maybe I would worry about them. But on this hand, diamonds rates to be the correct strain for North/South.|
