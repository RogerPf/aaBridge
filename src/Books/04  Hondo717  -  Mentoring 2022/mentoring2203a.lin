UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, with the West hand I would have opened 1@C and rebid 1N over 1@S. Yes, 1N is imperfect, but there are hands where you have to bid 1N over @1S with a singleton spade. Further, this illustrates my point about opening 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. Clearly the 8-card club fit is better than the 7 card diamond fit.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 2 key cards and ostensibly does not have the trump queen. So many players would bid 5@H which shows 2 key cards with no @SQ. However, that is not correct because the 6th spade in West hand is just as good as having the @SQ.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a known 10-card fit when spades break 2-1, which they will almost all of the time, the @SQ will come down after two rounds. Therefore, on this hand West should respond 5@S showing 2 keys and the @SQ (or extra length in this case).|
