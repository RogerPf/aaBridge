mb|3S|mb|P|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S by East was perfectly reasonable. However, at favorable vulnerability (you not vul, they vul) you should be even more aggressive preempting. East has wonderful distribution 7-4-2-0. So at this vulnerability 4@S would be a better call. As as it turns out West is strong enough to bid 4@S.|

up|24|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, at trick four, it is obvious to try and cash the @CA after ruffing the 3rd heart. On other hands, if the @CA were not the setting trick, there are cases where if I gave a suit preference for clubs, partner should trust me and underlead the @CA.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, because the @CA is the setting trick the @CA is the better play.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, when you have a long suit and a void, your hand is much more powerful. Whenever you have a void, that is almost like adding 4 points to your hand because if you play in your long suit, having a void is just as good as having the ace in your void suit. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is another reason why, although 3@S was fine, East should consider opening 4@S.|

And we play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| over 1N. So, East would double to show a single suited hand. On the other hand, being vulnerable, with no singletons or voids, although I would double to show a single suited hand, there is a good case to pass as well.|

Opening leads are very difficult so anything you can do to help out partner is good.
