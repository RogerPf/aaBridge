up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand was a bit unlucky in that the diamond and heart finesses both lost. The 2@D was quite aggressive. The argument against it is 5-3-3-2 and being vulnerable. If North were more unbalanced (e.g. had a singleton, it would have been a better bid). |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We might still end up in 3@D even if North opens 1@D which some may do although in general I am not a big fan of opening with a flat 11 HCP. However, in this case, using Bergen "adjusted HCP" and the rule of 20, North has 11 HCP and can add 1 point for the quality diamond suit. |
