pc|S5|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North can count off the top 6 clubs, 2 hearts, and 2 diamonds. So North needs 2 more tricks. A diamond ruff is 1. If diamonds are 3-3 that will set up diamonds. But if they are not, that is a problem.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North might be able to set up a heart trick. That is still only an 11th trick. So the best shot is to try to ruff a diamond and see what develops.|

mb|1D|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A very nice double by East although only 11 HCP, with perfect distribution. These days players are making lighter takeout doubles and not always having an opening hand.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The standard way for responder to bid over a takeout doubles are:
1 level bids are forcing and unlimited;
2 level bids show less than 10 points and a 5+ card suit.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I bid 2@C here that would show 5 clubs and less than 10 points. Another choice is for me to redouble if I had 10 or more points and no good bid at the 1 level. I also can pass if I have nothing useful to say. However, if you wanted to bid 1@H, I would not say that was wrong.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear what West should do here. 2 reasonable choices are 1N (which typically shows 8-10) or pass. I am reluctant to play a 1 level contract doubled because it is very hard to defend and take 7+ tricks. So I like 1N better.|

pc|DJ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The standard lead by North is the @DJ if you play "coded tens", then North would lead the 10. If you lead the jack and play coded tens, that shows J109 or J108 and denies anything higher. If you lead the ten that typically shows 2 higher, e.g. AJ10 or KJ10 although sometimes it is top of nothing.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out we could do better if North cashed 2 diamonds and then led clubs but hard to know that. So I let the play stand as is because the defense was far from clear.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also West could have ducked the first club because it would be hard for North to know to play the @CK and crash West's @CQ. That is also not obvious.|

mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is pretty much standard these days to open 1N with a balanced 15-17 and a 5 card major. It is possible you miss a 5-3 fit in your major, though that doesn't happen that often. And when it does, often 3N is as good as or better a contract.|
