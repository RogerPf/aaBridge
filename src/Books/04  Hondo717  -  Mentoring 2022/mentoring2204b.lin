If you have 10 or more points you often redouble and if you make a bid at the 2 level that shows less than 10 points. For example, if I bid 2@D, that would show less than 10 points.|

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


mb|2S?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, with East hand, I would bid 3@D. On this auction, West has to have at least 4 diamonds because  West does not have 4 heart or even 3 hearts. With 4 hearts West would raise to 2@H. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you play support doubles, West would double 1@S to show 3 card heart support. Further, based on the auction, NS have an 8-card spade fit at least meaning West has no more than 2 spades. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So West has to have 5 diamonds most likely. I am not saying most players can figure that out. But the information is there if you care to use it.|

pc|s2S5|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't mind the @S2 as a lead and generally speaking I prefer leading count to attitude. Therefore, from 3 small I like to lead small. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there is one exception, which is quite important here. And that is, if you raise partner then partner knows you have 3 cards in their suit. So attitude is useful in that case.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain how it works here. Since North lead a low spade, that should show an honor meaning, since North would not lead away from the @SA North should have the @SQ meaning I should play the @SK. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if partner led the @S9 I would know North does not have the @SQ and therefore West started with AQ doubleton and I would play a low so the @SJ does not set up. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All the subtleties are important on defense which is why proper carding is crucial if you want to defend well. 
Okay, we undo the lead so North can lead the @S9.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East definitely should not pass. Personally I would bid 2@H which is a slight overbid, but its close.
