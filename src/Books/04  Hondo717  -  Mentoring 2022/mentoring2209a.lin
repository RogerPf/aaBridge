West could easily be short in spades and I know East has at most 2 hearts. So the best way to guard against a bad spade break plus extraneous heart ruffs is to play the @SA and low spade.|

On the other hand, I know West probably does not have 4 clubs based on the auction and the cards I have seen so far. The safest way to play the suit is the @CK first because I can pick up J98x of clubs in the West hand. Suit combinations can be important and you should strive to figure out the best way to play different suit combinations.|
