On this hand you just bid 4@H. No need to explore. Strong enough to make 4 and not strong enough to be in slam. You know where you want to be and why give the opponents a chance to interfere.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 4@H by North was aggressive. A good principle is "game before slam" and with North's hand, although it is quite powerful with the heart void given it only has 8 HCP you need much for slam to be likely.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to have no more than 1 loser in spades, clubs, and diamonds. Then it is on one of two finesses assuming you don't lose the @SJ in addition to the @SA.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West can count 6 spade tricks. In this case since there are 7 spades remaining between the other 3 hands, West can assume that partner holds 2.33 spades which means in general, with a 3-2 break his hand will take 6 spades. So he has 6 spade tricks, 1 heart, and 2 diamonds for 9 tricks.|

mb|2C|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a couple of ways to play responses over 2@C. One way is to play that 2@D over 2@C shows at least one ace or king or 5+ points and 2@H shows a bust (no aces or kings and fewer than 5 points). I don't like that.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I pretty much always bid 2@D over 2@C to give partner a chance to describe their hand and if partner happens to bid 2@H or 2@S, I play that 3@C shows a bust. However, that does on rare occasions, as we have here, cause a problem.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if I have clubs and good hand over 2@H or 2@S by partner, I have to bid 2N.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East can bid 1@C which is reasonable. However, although East has 15 HCP, with dubious @SQJ I personally still open 1N. If East wants to downgrade to 14, that is okay too.|

I do have the proper 5-4 distribution to make a DONT 2@D bid which shows diamonds and a major and I strain to interfere when I can. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I were not vul, I definitely would bid 2@D. But being vul, my hand is flawed. If the @HA were in the spade suit I definitely would bid 2@D. However, honors in short suit are flaws. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if the QJ of clubs were in diamonds same thing. For example, if I had the same number of points but my hand was @SAxxx @Hx @DQJxxx @Cxxx that is the same 7 HCP but the honors are much better placed and I would bid 2@D. But here because of the flaws I will reluctantly pass.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A bit unlucky. To his credit, East played the hand correctly, discarding the club and taking the spade finesse before drawing trump. With 3-2 hearts or if the spade finesse works 4@H makes.|
