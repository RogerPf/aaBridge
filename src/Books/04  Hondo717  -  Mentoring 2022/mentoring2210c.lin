mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss what West should bid. Some people like to open light at the one level in 3rd seat. I am not one of them, and a majority of players do not agree with me. I like to use the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at|, so partner always knows when I have an opening hand. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I love to preempt, particularly in 3rd seat particularly when not vulnerable against vulnerable opponents. So I strain to preempt when I can in 3rd seat. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The math supports why preempting in 3rd seat is often a good idea. Although it is not always true, on average after 2 passes, the first 2 players usually average around 16 HCP between them. That means 3rd and 4th seat have around 24 on average. If 3rd seat subtracts their HCP from 24, they have a reasonable estimate of how strong 4th seat is.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West almost meets the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at|, so I would not hate opening 1@S. |

PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with 9 HCP, 24 - 9 is 15, so North probably has around 15 HCP. Therefore, in 3rd seat, you should strain to preempt even with a 5-card suit. based on what I explained I believe 2@S is the better opening bid.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


mb|2S|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best option for North is to bid 2N. Whenever you have the values for a NT opener or overcall, you should make it. With 16 HCP, 2N is the most descriptive bid. Admittedly Ax of spades is somewhat problematic. However, it still gets your strength across which is very important. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double by North is much more ambiguous in terms of strength.|

mb|2N|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had North doubled, East should bid 3@S even though a 3rd seat West may sometimes open a weak 2 with a 5 card suit.

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West passed. North opens 1NT and we end up in either 2N or 3N. Then East has a natural diamond lead. We will end up taking 4 hearts, 2 diamonds, 1 spade and 1 club for 8 tricks. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if we are in 3 we are down 1 perhaps. But if we are in 2 we are making it. Further, if West ends up getting end played in spades, we might end up making 3NT. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This way EW got a small minus which at worst in IMPs will cost them an IMP or two and might even gain them IMPs. Also, had I not coached North to take their @CK, West would have actually made the hand.|

mb|P|mb|1H|mb|2D?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East can pass which is technically correct. Had North passed I definitely would pass with the East hand. However, because of the 2 diamond bid by North, I might compete with 2@H though being vulnerable makes it a bit risky.|

PG| ***** 46 ***** |


mb|p|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear what North should do. In Match Points I would double. North has 2 likely tricks, one heart and one spade. And the @CK and @DA are possible tricks. If they make 4@H in Match Points it will be close to a bottom anyway, Whereas down 1 for +200 will likely be a good board for us. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I call that the ^*Bbad board theory^*N where you sometimes double in Match Points because the double is not likely to cost much even if they make it, since making it would be a good board in and of itself. But in IMPs it is less clear, unless North thinks it is down 2. So pass is reasonable.|

pc|DA|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I normally don't like leading unprotected aces. However, I think on this hand the @DA is clearly the best lead. It is not totally without risk in that one opponent could have a void and the other the @DK. But that is pretty unlikely. Besides no other lead is better. So this is a rare case where an unprotected ace is a good lead.|

Even if you take away my @SJ giving me 9 HCP I still would bid 3N because of my 3 honor quality heart suit and the @C10, which are upgrades. I would do that in IMPs but not in Match Points.|
