mb|1D|mb|P|mb|2C|at|^B@2^*BWest: ^*NWhen playing 2/1, do you play 2@C over 1@D establishes a game force?|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people these days play 2@C over 1@D establishes a game force when playing 2/1. I used to play that it did not establish a game force. The reason being, when you have an invitational hand with nice clubs, you have no good bid (1NT or 2NT seems very wrong). |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Currently, I play 2@C over 1@D establishes a game force when playing 2/1 because I believe the plusses of having it being a game force far outweigh the minuses. Certainly that is true on this hand where I think we are likely to end up in slam.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 2@C bid does not deny a 4-card major. With 5 clubs and a 4 card major and a game force I would bid 2@C. In fact, a good way to play is to bid 2@C even with 4 clubs and 4 of a major. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is what Marty Bergen recommends. He feels that the most important thing is to establish the game force. You can then worry about your major suit fits since you have plenty of room to bid.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is just bidding out your shape. It denies 4 hearts, shows 4 spades, and does not show anything extra.|

PG| ***** 10 ***** |


pc|SQ|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|pc|SK|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not the correct play. At best it makes no difference since West cannot possibly hold the @SA. And what it does here is estrablish 2 more spade tricks for me. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East might as well duck as there is no upside to covering and as a general defensive rule, when an honor is led off dummy for a finesse, you cover the last honor in dummy not the first. So using that rule, East should not cover until the @S10 is played.|

pg| ***** 17 ***** |


pc|CJ|pc|S3|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another good defensive rule is ^*BKeeping Parity with Dummy^*n. Here West should discard a heart rather than a spade. Once he discards a spade, dummy's @SJ and @S10 will get rid of West's remaining 7x in spades and the @S5 (had I not discarded it) would have been good. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West had discarded a heart, he would have 7xx of spades remaining. So after I cashed the @SJ and @S10, West would have the @S7 remaining and my @S5 would not be good. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is part of the general theme ^*BKeeping Parity with Dummy^*n meaning when you have a suit the same length as dummy, you need to keep the same length so that you don't set up low cards in dummy's suit.|

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I have 6 sure tricks now. My slam is cold. I have 2 ways to try for 7. Both of which happen to work on this hand. I can play for the @DQ to drop in 2 or 3 rounds or play for the Diamond finesse. Although in general a 3-3 break occurs only 40% of the time.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| When you have a 7 card fit missing the queen, it turns out the odds of the queen dropping in 3 rounds or fewer is 50% because on some of the 4-2 breaks the queen is doubleton.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, I luckily make 6@C anyway, but only because both the spade finesse and diamond finesse work. Now let me discuss opening leads against slams. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against a grand slam, you try and make a neutral lead. That usually means you lead a long suit with no honors, unless it has been bid by the opponents. However, against a suit contract, you try and make an aggressive lead to establish a trick for your side. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means unlike when defending against a game, you should lead away from a king or queen. That was especially true on this hand, where hearts were the unbid suit. The best lead for West would have been a heart and what I would have chosen.|

For example, I will open 2NT with 2 doubletons (5-4-2-2 or 6-3-2-2) or occasionally even a hand where I have a singleton King or Ace if I don't think it is strong enough to open 2@C.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I certainly think 3N is a reasonable bid. Another possibiity would be |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=stayman,Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| because of the 4-card heart suit.

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I can count 4 diamonds at least, 1 heart, 1 spade, and 1 club. That is seven tricks. If diamonds don't break I need West to have the @SK so I have another entry to dummy. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It has to do with your combined length in trump.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly, 6@H is not a wonderful contract and in practice no pair would get to 6 although it supports the LOTT.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if I bid 3@D over 3@C, that shows at least one 4-card major. So I am going to bid 3@D because I have 4-card hearts. Here, where ^*BPuppet ^*n gets a little tricky. Over my 3@D bid North bids 3 of the major she does not have which in this case the bid would be 3@S showing 4-card hearts and ^*bNOT^*n 4 spades. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that fashion the stronger hand (South here) will declare. If I have hearts I bid 4@H (as I will here). If I don't have hearts I bid 3N. In the rare case where North has both 4 card majors, North would bid 4@D and I would bid my 4-card major. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, it is a bit complicated and not important that you play it since most of the time 3N is just as good as 4 of a major with a 5-3 fit.|

pc|S8|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, slam is a pretty nice contract. I can count 1 spade, 4 hearts, 5 clubs, and a diamond and I can ruff at least 1 diamond in dummy for a 12th trick. Of course on this hand, with the 4-1 heart break I am only making 5. However, 6 would make if hearts were 3-2 which is 68%.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A little unlucky. If there is a preempt (particularly a 7+ card suit) the odds of a 4-1 break go up a lot, probably from 32% to 40%. Also I think there are other bids East could have made including pass. Personally I might have tried 3N.|
