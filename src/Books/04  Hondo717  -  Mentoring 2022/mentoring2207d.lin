up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, assuming I lead a heart, let's see what EW can make in NT. They probably make because the @DK is onside. If I lead a heart they end up taking 4 clubs 3 diamonds and 2 hearts for 9 tricks. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, they can make ten tricks if they drop the singleton club King. On the other hand, if I don't bid they probably don't get to 3N. Therefore, I would guess they got a pretty good result. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It worked out better for EW this time because they guessed correctly what to do though often they won't. Many players would pass with the West hand or not know what to bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2nd seat you want to be a little more cautious. The reason is since one opponent passed, it is much more likely that partner has some values and you don't want to encourage him too much.|

If the @SK were not singleton, E/W would have a better case looking for slam. Yet it turns out 6@H does have plays particularly because of my lead and my having Qxx of spades doesn't hurt either. Even if I didn't, it turns out declarer only has one diamond loser because of the diamond 9 and 8.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWhy should one not open weak in Clubs or Diamonds with 6 card minor and 5 carded major?|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because you might miss a major suit fit. You can open a weak 2 with a 4 card major because it is not likely you have a major suit fit, and even if you do, usually your 6 card suit plays better. However, with a 5 card major you are more likely to miss a major suit fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 2@D (GF) and then bid 4@S over whatever I bid. In 2/1 that shows a weak game forcing hand with 3-card support which is what you have. Note that if you had 4-card support, you would make a Jacoby 2NT response. Your hand counts to 13 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Bergen Dummy Points ^*N|CP||FP||at| (10 HCP, 1 length, and 2 for singleton).|
