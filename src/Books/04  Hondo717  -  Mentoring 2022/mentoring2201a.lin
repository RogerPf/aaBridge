Using |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenhandevaluation,Bergen Hand Evaluation^*N|CP||FP||at|, you deduct 1 for Jx in diamonds but add one back for KQJ of clubs and you could take one off for quacks.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also not sure why North did not bid 1@S rather than 2@C. If he does that, I will bid either 1N or 2N. Over 2@C I could have passed but it is barely possible we have game, particularly since I have 3 clubs.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, 3@C is difficult and a bit unlucky. However, once West plays the @C10 on the first club trick, North should entertain the possibility that it was a singleton and East started with 4 clubs.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The spade suit might be a little weak but that shouldn't matter given the 15 dummy points. If West, for example, had say 12 or even 13 dummy points, then I might be a little more conservative with only an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, it is correct for West to assume East has exactly 4 spades because that will be correct 99% of the time. The only time East will have 5 spades if he had 6 diamonds and 5 spades, which is very rare. |

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a problem hand over forcing NT. There is a convention known as ^*BFlannery^*n which happens to take care of this hand. I think it is a very dumb convention, because it takes care of a problem that comes up once a year (you are 4-5-2-2 and open 1@H and partner bids 1N) which is very rare. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you play it, it means you open 2@D when you have 4 spades 5 hearts and 11-15 HCP. Anyway, I have to bid 2@C here which normally shows at least 3 clubs and it usually works out anyway because partner almost never leaves me in clubs.|

mb|2C|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North made a good bid. That is a perfect limit raise. She is showing a 3 card limit raise.

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am a little worried about my weak hearts, particularly since I know we have only an 8 card fit. Please note that whenever you have an 8 card fit, you should be a bit more conservative. And whenever you have a 9+ card fit, you should be aggressive. The 9th trump is often worth an extra trick. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You just have to be willing to accept the fact that on occasion you will get too high. However, the number of hands where you do better than most pairs far exceeds the number of hands where you do worse. |

mb|P|mb|3C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since you can't open a Weak-2 in clubs and you have 6 clubs and want to preempt, you have to open 3@C. Let me discuss my criteria for opening 3@C with a 6 card suit. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 1st seat, I will open 3@C with a 6-card suit unless I have no singletons or voids.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, I will open 3@C with a 6-card suit regardless of my distribution (although if I have a flat weak hand and am vulnerable I might occasionally pass, but usually not).|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2nd seat, I tend not to open 3@C with a 6-card suit because in 2nd seat, you are more likely to preempt yourpartner than in other seats since 1st seat has passed, that means it is more likely that partner has a decent hand. So in general in 2nd seat, I tend to have more standard preempts. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this deal, 3@C has particular merit because of the vulnerability. Whenever you are at favorable vulnerability (you are not and they are) you should be particularly aggressive about preempting. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I might also open 3@C with East hand, despite my rule about 2nd seat, at this vulnerability and as you can see it does effectively preempt me. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would be tempted to bid 3N had partner not passed, even though I am technically a point light. However, because my 3 aces and quality spade suit are worth an extra point or two given partner passed, it is not that likely we have game so I will reluctantly pass. Further, partner, if short in clubs, might balance anyway.|

pc|CTd8h7|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, North has difficulty to to discard. A proper discard would give N/S the last two tricks. There were 2 ways North could have avoided the discard problem at trick 12. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|a) He should cash the @HJ when in at trick 7, thereby avoiding the problem of not knowing whether or not his heart is good.) Failing that, if he has a good defender as a partner who would have discarded his last heart if he held it, he knows East holds the remaining heart.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1D|mb|D|mb|P|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 2@S bid shows invitational values and 4 or more spades.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


mb|4D|mb|4S|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|5D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An interesting call by West. So let us discuss the pros and cons of 5@D. West has wonderful distribution and a spade void which are both big plusses for bidding 5@D. However, with 15 HCP it is likely partner has just about nothing and West is vul and we are not.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if East has the QJ of clubs, then granted 5@D is only down 1. However, it is virtually impossible for West to hold say the @HK and @CQ which might allow 5@D to make. So still could easily lose 2 clubs and 1 heart. On balance, at this vul, I think 5@D is too aggressive though I applaud West for being aggressive in general even if on occasion it does not turn out well. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, with some pairs, it might induce them to bid 5@S though it is unlikely that NS have a 10 card spade fit because North likely has no more than 4 spades and south shouldn't have more than 5 because otherwise South would open a Weak-2.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So partner likely has at least 4 spades which is going to make 4S hard to play which is another reason not to bid 5@D.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, since we have the majority of the points we should lead trump to take away ruffs by declarer. Since East has 5 spades I know West is out and I also know that if West has another heart he will get a discard on the @H10.|

up|27|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At 4@S we lose at least 2 diamonds, a club, and a heart. We take 2 clubs, 2 hearts, and at least 4 spades. We will have nine tricks if I can manage a heart ruff which I think I can. So 4@S is down 1.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly, if our diamonds were not 2-2 we might be making 4 spades particularly if I had a 5th spade. So at any other vulnerability 5@D could have worked out quite well for East/West.|
