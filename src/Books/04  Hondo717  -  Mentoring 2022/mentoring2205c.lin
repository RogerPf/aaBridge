up|33|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do think East should make that hand because the @DJ provides declarer with a higher percentage than the @DK though the @DK is certainly not out of the question.|

mb|1C?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a lot of tactical considerations to consider before selecting my bid. We are at favorable vulnerability (meaning we are not vul and the opponents are) which favors preempting. I have a singleton club and am 6-4. Even if partner is short in spades, I probably have no spade losers. So I think the best tactical bid is 4@S.|

sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way to play diamonds with this combination is to hope for either a 2-2 break, or that East has a singleton honor. More often than not you will lose only one diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other way to play it is to hope that West has KQ of diamonds and lead low to the @DJ. However, given the auction, that is not likely. On this hand I always lose 2 diamonds but sometimes I might not.|
