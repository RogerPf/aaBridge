The inserted auction follows the  |ia|--ppp1cpp2cpp2hpp!3spp3npp4c4d4h4sppp|at|  flow of the text.  By default the first to bid is always West, but in the above example two hyphens '--' are used to make both West's and North's bids blank so the bidding now starts with East. A comma, a space or a mixture of the three will do the same job.

Note that there is (a real!) exclamation mark preceding the 3 Spade bid. This is an alert/announcement, it shows as as rectangle behind the bid.  Bids showing on a standard table @st! have an additional option in that they can have announce text using !an!. There is no such facility here when using the !ia! command.

The final bid  !ia!1hp1sp2dp?!  can be a question mark.  |ia|1hp1sp2dp?|at|  This is most useful when also showing a hand and asking the user to select a bid with a question.


There is a second form of !ia! see the next page.

A second form is   !ia!O2c2d2h3h!4n!5h6hp!  |ia|O2c2d2h3h!4n!5h6hp|at|  As you can see by looking at the example string there is the letter 'O' at the front of the bidding string. Only the Opener and Responder bids are supplied or displayed. 

|cp|7|at|^*b ^cNotice @- that the exclamation mark of the   alert  comes    BEFORE    the bid.

^cThis is the OPPOSITE of the   ia  (Insert Auction) command.           NOT  MY  DESIGN ^*n|cp||at|
