A lin file is an ordinary text file whose name end with the '.lin' file extension.  A lin file can be edited with any standard text editor.  do ^*B NOT ^*N use a word processor.

A lin file contains a mixture of commands and data that tell the 'lin file playing program' (in this case ^*baaBridge^*n) what to put on the screen for you to see.

Commands are always two (2) letters long with a bar character after the letter pair. The two letters can each be upper or lower case. The pair of letters and their 'bar character' is followed by text, which is often empty, and then by another 'bar character'.  After that everything is ignored except the two last characters before the next bar.  Those two characters are the next command.

It is impossible display the 'bar character' within a lin file, so ^*ball examples of commands^*n will use an exclamation mark '!' to stand in for the 'bar character', |cp|7|at|^*bthis will not be mentioned again^*n|cp||at|.   For example 
the  !at!  command, think @- Add Text, may appear as -

^g!at!This will show on your screen.!  

will make happen -

|at|^g     |at|This will show on your screen.|

n#|5|at|


|n^|5|at|Notice that for clarity, I have started the example with an '!'.  This is actually the end character of the previous command's data.  In real lin files it is often found on the previous line.  It is shown here to make it clear that this is a command.  So every command has  ^*b EXACTLY ^*n two '!'s, (bar characters) @- no more no fewer @-.
|n#|5|at|^fThese are,  the one that follows the command   and the one that follows its data.

In future, the day the those are good but there is way send moreat the end of every page, please click   ^*bFlow >^*n   or use the  ^*bRight Arrow^*n  on your keyboard
|n#|5|at|^p( OR   even better use a |cp|gr|at| ^*b Mouse Wheel ^*n |cp||at|)
