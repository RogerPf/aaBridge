Once you have used   !tu!Y!   or   !tu!!    for the first time there is no way back to the  'visible for one !pg!! only'  mode.   You will have to keep using    !tu!Y!   or   !tu!!    yourself to control the visibility.

An  !mn!  Header has its own rules @- 
^c@2
It always puts itself at the top of the page. 

It decides its own color.

It ignores any margins you may have set. 

The text has its own set font and size and it is always light in color.  

Up to a certain size it will fit itself on to one line.

^b@2
Go over that size and @-

If you write a    huge  mn-header     that would spill on to a third line then   NOTHING   will be shown.

If you inspect this lin file you will see that there are two   mn-headers   defined on this page.

Only the second one gets shown.


The switch to turn the   mn-headers   on or off       !tu!y!     !tu!!     can be set many times on the page 

but only the last value (the one before the end !pg! of the page) counts.
