^b@2^*bInternal Link    -       @^*g....^*n|

Internal links go inline in text and have the form  @-

^d^*b@^*g<qx_label>,^*nNice text you can see and click on^*b@^*n^*n

Note the  ^*b@^*g^*n  which marks the start and the  ^*b@^*n^*n  which marks the end. The <qx_label> must match a 'qx label' somewhere in the lin file.  They have fixed display and hover colors.

^c^*glast,Clicking Here ^*n will take you to the last page of this lin file



^b@2^*bqx_label    -       !qx! ABCD, <wide><thin><hide>^*n any other text ignored !


^*bABCD^*n is the name of the qx_label that the above jump will jump to.

Every qx_label produces a bump on the  Navbar.

^*baaBridge^*n  automatically works out whether these bumps should be wide or thin.

^cqx_lables followed by a lot of  !pg!!'s  will be wide.

^cqx_labels with an empty  ^*bABCD^*n  text will be thin.

You can override this behaviour by adding   <wide><thin><hide>^*n as shown above.  Hide does what it says.  Jumps will still work to a hidden qx_label.


This lin file contains a selection of such jumps as you can see by the bumps on the  Navbar  below.

^b@2^*bInternal Link   (to another file in the book)  -       @^*g....^*n      this is an|cp|7|at| aaBridge only|cp||at| feature

Write the <qx_label> in your link to as 
|lg|f|n^|3|at|
^c <qx_label^*b^*n>                                 ^mto target a  qx_label in  THE SAME FILE
^c <qx_label^*b:^*npart_filename>                   ^mto target a file in the   THE SAME FOLDER    (qx_label is optional)   
^c <qx_label^*b:^*npart_filename^*b::^*npart_foldername>  ^mto target a file in a      DIFFERENT FOLDER             ^w "
^c            ^g       <^*b::^*npart_foldername>  ^nFIRST file in      DIFFERENT FOLDER             ^w "        (no qx)
^c <qx_label^*b:::^*npart_filenname>  ^mto target a file in an    UNNAMED FOLDER                              ^w "
|lg||at|
where 'part_filename' matches ^*bany part^*n of the filename of another lin file in the current book.  The files are tested in alphabetic order so the early ones will match first.

As always in aaBridge if you follow a link to a different lin file you can return using the  |fp|1|n#|3|at|@L|fp||n^|3|at|   icon button, top left.
|n#|5|at|^t   next the the   |fp|1|n#|3|at|@z|fp||n^|3|at|  button.|

	^*bBooks-E  internal links^*n  
	
^c@2If you write an aaBridge "Book" the whole thing can be added to aaBridge by zipping up the file structure as a .zip or .linzip and draging and droping it on to an open aaBridge window.  It will remain on the menu bar as an option until you restart aaBridge.

For more info see the  document collection doc ...  

^d ^*bBooks-E  -  adding  'books'  to aaBridge^*n

An index lin is often the first linfile in the first folder of such books.  The top folder name must start with the name  Books-E  (^*bE^*n for external) eg...

^d ^*b Books-E___Goren's_Famous_Hands ^*n

Within such books the Internal link format below can be useful     (no working example is provided here)

^d^*b @^*g|cp|red|at|::##42:1|cp||at|,^*n Against Culbertson^*n^*b@^*n^*n

The |cp|red|at|^*b 42 ^*n|cp||at| is the Book-Id (required at the front of very book folder) of the target folder in the zipped file.|lg|g|at|  
The |cp|red|at|^*b :1 ^*n|cp||at| makes the jump to the 2nd lin file in that folder (the optional |cp|red|at|^*b :1 ^*n|cp||at|meaning skip ^*bone^*n),  This is useful when you plan to be adding more recent files to a folder and you want, for example, to skip over an index linfile at the front of the target folder and so arrive at your most recent addition.
|n^|8|at| 
 ^d ^*b Books-E|cp|red|at|^*b1^*n|cp||at|___Goren's_Famous_Hands ^*n     In the folder name, the red |cp|red|at|^*b 1 ^*n|cp||at| has the ^^^m same skip effect for that Book's menubar Menu.
