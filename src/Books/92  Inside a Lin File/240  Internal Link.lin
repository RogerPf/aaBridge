^b@2^*bInternal Link    -       @^*g....^*n|

Internal links go inline in text and have the form  @-

^d^*b@^*g<qx_label>,^*nNice text you can see and click on^*b@^*n^*n

Note the  ^*b@^*g^*n  which marks the start and the  ^*b@^*n^*n  which marks the end. The <qx_label> must match a 'qx label' somewhere in the lin file.  They have fixed display and hover colors.

^c^*glast,Clicking Here ^*n will take you to the last page of this lin file



^b@2^*bqx_label    -       !qx! ABCD, <wide><thin><hide>^*n any other text ignored !


^*bABCD^*n is the name of the qx_label that the above jump will jump to.

Every qx_label produces a bump on the  Navbar.

^*baaBridge^*n  automatically works out whether these bumps should be wide or thin.

^cqx_lables followed by a lot of  !pg!!'s  will be wide.

^cqx_labels with an empty  ^*bABCD^*n  text will be thin.

You can override this behaviour by adding   <wide><thin><hide>^*n as shown above.  Hide does what it says.  Jumps will still work to a hidden qx_label.


This lin file contains a selection of such jumps as you can see by the bumps on the  Navbar  below.

^b@2^*bInternal Link   (to another file in the book)  -       @^*g....^*n      this is an|cp|7|at| aaBridge only|cp||at| feature

Write the <qx_label> in your link to as 

^c <qx_label^*b^*n>                                 ^mto target a  qx_label in  THE SAME FILE

^c <qx_label^*b:^*npart_filename>                   ^mto target a file in the  THE SAME FOLDER    (qx_label is optional)   
 
^c <qx_label^*b:^*npart_filename::part_foldername>  ^mto target a file in a    DIFFERENT FOLDER             ^w "

^c <qx_label^*b:::^*npart_filenname>  ^mto target a file in an    UNNAMED FOLDER                              ^w "

where 'part_filename' matches ^*bany part^*n of the filename of another lin file in the current book.  The files are tested in alphabetic order so the early ones will match first.
