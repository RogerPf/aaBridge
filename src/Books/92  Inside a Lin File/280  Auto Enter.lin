A virgin deal is one that has only ONE  ^*b md!! ^*n cmd    and does NOT have any  ^*b nt!! ^*n  or  ^*b at!! ^*n  cmds. 
Virgin deals are automatically opened  as if  the  ^*b Enter the Deal ^*n  button has just been clicked.
This is exactly what you want to happen when you open a deal that you played on-line and have now downloaded.

The ^*b ae!! ^*n command  tells aaBridge to treat a lin file with one  ^*b md!! ^*n as  virgin no matter the consequences. There for it will be "Auto Entered".
^eThis works best in a near virgin deal with just one or two added  ^*b nt!! ^*n  and  ^*b at!! ^*n  commands.
