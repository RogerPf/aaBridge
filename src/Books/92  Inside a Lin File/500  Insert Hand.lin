The hand definitions follow the flow of the text.  Up to four hands or part hands, south first. Any missing hand is NOT auto filled in.^^^f|

at|^^^^Please note that the example shown above has a 'p' as the first character in the South hand, it means pictures. Pictures and any other first character options are not supported and are ignored.

Also NOT supported and ignored are  ^*bhc^*n!<cards>!    highlight  cards    and    ^*blc^*n!<cards>!   lowlight  cards.

Note that a "page"  i.e.  the display between one  ^*bnt!!^*n  cmd   and the next has to be 

   either 
^d all opaque floating hands 
   OR 
^d all Transparent  floating hands -  you cannot mix them.

^d( this is a non-issue. ) |

^c xe!!         %% this prohibits eXit from the End   by mouse wheel and stepping etc


Do what the comments  that come after them say they do

Try using the arrow keys on your keyboard or your mouse wheel to step out of this Lin file.


The actual real instruction of which can be found at the front of this and file.

That is the conventional place to put them as they affect the whole file and cannot be turned on or off.  

They were primarily designed for use on the aaBridge welcome page and are used to prevent  users inadvertently stepping into the SPECIALS that you can see at the bottom of the left-hand column on that page.

Note by design they do not stop entry into  Lin file if the user is holding down the control key as they rotate a mouse wheel.
