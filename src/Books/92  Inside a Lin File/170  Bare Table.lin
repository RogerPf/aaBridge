^b@2^*bBare Table  @-  bt!!^*n^z@3|fp||

By default ^*baaBridge^*n and all other lin file players, start by displaying the four seats of a bridge table.  (There is also a command to do this later in the file @-  the  (st!! command, think  @- Standard Table).  Tutorial lin files like this one, need to start with a blank screen.    This is done with the   bt!!   command, think  @-  Bare Text. 
^^
^*bbt!!^*n      is normally the first command in this lin file, after the font and color definitions.|

at|^^^^^^^^^^|at|^*bnt! ... !     @-     New Text^*n   

The  ^*bnt!!^*n   command does everything that  at!!  does in addition it also clears almost everything that is displayed in the text area of the tutorial.  This includes the text, the margins and the headers (all covered later).

In older lin files you may often  see     pg!!nt!!     meaning   end of current 'page'   wipe all and start a new 'page'.|

The most important thing about ^*b rq ^*n is that it ^*b must immediately be followed ^*n an |cp|red|at|^*bnt^*n|cp||at|  command.

If the current ^*b aaBridge ^*n is the required version or later then the ^*b nt ^*n command is killed and has no effect.

Otherwise the NT commmand clears the screen as normal and displays the text ^*b THEN ^*n the movie is ended, no later pages are available to the viewer.
   
The  ^*b rq ^*n  command was added in ^*b aaBridge ^*n build |cp|blee|at|^*b2814^*n|cp||at|


^d^*bHow the   rq   command works in older versions of aaBridge ^*n

As older versions of ^*b aaBridge ^*n just ignore the ^*b rq ^*n  command the following ^*b nt ^*n  command  is ALWAYS obeyed.

So the user always gets the screen cleared and the text displayed to them  (which is what you want to happen).

For the above to make sense you need to immediately follow the 

^e rq^*n!xxxx!|cp|red|at|^*bnt^*n|cp||at|!...   ...!     
 
sequence with the  the first ^*b pg ^*n  of your movie.     This is  the ^*b pg ^*N  that ends your first page.


^*bFYI ^*n @- If you want to tell users of the old windows only lin file player that they need to upgrade  then at the very start for your file use the sequence. 

^*bnt^*n|cp||at|!...text telling the user they need  aaBridge ^*n! 
^*bip^*n|cp||at|!^L the  ^*b ip ^*n command will make the old player  STOP.

nt|^^^b@2^*bStandard Table^*n^g^*bst!!^*n|at|^z@3

This is a standard table created by the   ^*bst!!^*n   command.   This is the default for new lin files.

You need to use a  Bare Text   ^*b bt!!^*n   at the start of your lin file to get an empty full screen.|

You  CAN  use an insert, ie: a  'vv'  inside  a  Set String   'ss'.
