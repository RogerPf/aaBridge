So far, if you have been reading these files in order, all the commands have been of the form  !xy!<text>!    This topic introduces another form of command, the in-line character sequences that you find in the text following an   !at!   (and of course !nt!).

^c@@2 ^eSets the left hand margin (to the current position). ^q@@1 ^sClears the left hand margin.

^c@@3 ^eSets the right hand margin (to the current position). ^q@@0 ^sClears the right hand margin.



^b@2^*bHorizontal Position^*n

You can set the current horizontal position, where on the line next piece of text will appear, by using  @^<letter>  where <letter> is  a to z,  or  A to Z.  Every line is divided up into 26 segments the far left is at position 'a'  and the far right at position 'z'.

It is considered good practice to start every page (after an !nt!) with a sequence that sets the left hand margin to position b.  So a fragment like the following is common @-


!nt!!
at!|cp|7|at|^*b@^b@@2|cp||at|^*n
This would appear on the second line of the page, exactly where the word   ^*bMargins^*n   can now be seen (above).|
