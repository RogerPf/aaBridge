UP|40|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a couple of comments. First, I believe that you should open all 15-17 balanced hands 1N, even with a 5 card major. That is why I opened my hand 1N. Some may argue 2H is a better contract, but I would say both contracts are about the same, and they both should go down with perfect defense.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Elizabeth's diamond lead was a good choice. The question is, is the 3 or the 8 correct. Some would argue the 8 because the 3 might imply an honor. Others would argue that the 8 implies less than 4 diamonds, top of nothing. There is no universal agreement.  I would tend to lead the 3 but that is just style.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, given Elizabeth lead the 8, Vered should realize South has the Jack. Therefore she should play a different suit after winning the trick. If she knew that Elizabeth had 4, she could play the King pinning the Jack, but she has no way of knowing that. So a spade switch is probably right, or even the Queen of hearts. A low diamond will always give away a trick.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. West opened with diamond eight, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand.

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, as all of you know, I am a big believer in aggressive bidding. However, I think Elizabeth was somewhat too aggressive even for me by bidding 2S. She is at unfavorable vulnerability, she only has 5 spades, and they are not very good.  I think a strategic pass is best. One other point on the auction. Most people these days play 2C over 1D is a game force, if they play 2 over 1. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not. And this hand is a good example why 2C is a much more natural bid than 1N over 1D. Here is my reasoning as to why I do not think 2C should be a game force, although I am in the minority. With one of a major, you have the forcing NT for those hands when you have 10 or 11 points. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But over 1D the forcing NT does not apply. so I don't think 2C should be a game force, because you have no good way of showing a hand such as Eddy's hand. However, as I said, that is a minority opinion these days, just my two cents for what it is worth.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. The club play is an interesting problem. If Vered has the King, then Elizabeth made a nice play and she was rather unlucky that the King was offside and Vered had a singleton. So, I think the club play was correct in general, even though it did not work on this hand. Eddy made a very nice switch to the King of spades and partner should have honored that switch. Once she ruffs the club, she should play the nine of spades to take the last spade off dummy.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then Eddy gets to cash 2 more club tricks. As a result, not playing a spade cost their side 2 or 3 tricks. Since Eddy played the King, he must have the Queen so the spade is very safe. One other comment about leading the Ace of hearts from A K combination. I know on opening lead, you lead Ace from AK. However, in the middle of the hand, I recommend King from AK. Once that wins, partner knows you have the Ace.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whereas if you lead the A, partner is not sure who has the King. Eddy asked about Vered playing another diamond. Vered knows both Eddy and Elizabeth are out, so another diamond is not a good play. A spade is best, for the reasons stated.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am worried about six, but not sure how to bid it. Eddy's preempt did its work. It Caused us to miss slam. 6C is the best contract. Although I can see all hands, I bid as I would have on a regular table.|

UP|20|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not much to the play of this hand since diamonds break. 6C is a very good contract but Eddy made it difficult. Even if Elizabeth bids 3D, I will probably still bid 3N. In fact by bidding 3S, Elizabeth is showing a slightly stronger hand because she doesn't know I have that good a hand. The problem is I am not sure what slam we should be in. Although with my excellent clubs 6C probably has plays. But as I said Eddy's bid really stuck it to us. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had he bid 3S, we really would have had a problem. I think 3S is aggressive at unfavorable vulnerability, but certainly possible. At any other vulnerability, including both vul, I would bid 3S with his hand. At unfavorable vul, you can make a case for either 2S or 3S. 3S is down 3 or 4, so it does not work well if we double. But we might not. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That actually brings up one other interesting point. If it had gone 1C-3S, most people play double there by Elizabeth is negative  as do I. But Marty Bergen recommends another convention, which happens to work real well on this hand. It is called a "Thrump Double." It says, "partner, there is a good possibility we have 3N if you have a spade stopper"  which is the perfect bid for Elizabeth's hand over 3S. Bergen recommends negative doubles through 3C, and doubles of 3D, 3H, and 3S as Thrump Doubles. His booklet on modern doubles has more details.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now here is another difference between how I play and many other people play. Most people automatically bypass their diamonds to bid a 4 card major. But I only do so if I have a weak hand. With a hand worth a 2nd bid, I bid up the line, as I will have another chance to bid. The convention of by passing diamonds is known as Walsh, for those who are not familiar with the background.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, there was again lots to talk about the play. We discussed the bidding, and why I never mentioned my hearts. As to the play, let's first look at the opening lead.  Vered has a tough lead. However, on this hand, it is clear Elizabeth has clubs. So, a club is probably not a good lead. She opened 1C and bid 1NT over 1D, denying a 4 card major. Therefore, she has to have at least 4 clubs, because the only reason she would have 3 clubs is if she had a 4 card major.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*Bnome: ^*N|cp||at|Howard has an excellent lesson on "Counting Defenders Distributions" which you can find at his web site ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/##declarer^*N in the "Declarer Play Lessons" section. The BBO movie is awesome! I cannot help not plugging my work too!!|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, 85% of the time when someone opens better minor, they have a 4 card suit at least. So, you should assume if someone opens 1C or 1D, they probably have at least 4 in the suit. Therefore, I would probably lead a heart, which doesn't hurt and doesn't help,  partner  has 4 hearts and the honors will help set up the suit. On this hand it is neutral as it turns out. If South had not bid diamonds, I would lead a diamond, but since he did bid diamonds I think a major is called for.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, once a club is led, Elizabeth needs to count her tricks. She has eight sure tricks and needs to develop one more trick. Personally I would try to develop a diamond trick, as there are lots of combinations where you get a diamond. To get an extra hearts trick you need a 3-3 break. Whereas a diamond depends on basically the A, Q, or 10 being doubleton or a 3-3 break. So, at trick 2 I lead a low diamond which works well any time Eddy has the Queen and that is my ninth trick as is turns out. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Elizabeth sort of tried 2 things at once, and hence, should have gone down. First she tried hearts, and then switched to diamonds. Then, Eddy made a nice spade play. However, at trick nine, he then forgot to take the setting trick when Elizabeth led a 2nd diamond off dummy. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At that point his side has taken 3 tricks, and the Queen of diamonds and Queen of spades are both good. So, Eddy should take the Queen of diamonds and cash the Q of spades. Remember "It is never wrong to beat the contract." |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a lot of questions about the bidding here. Let me first discuss responses when partner opens 2C. Most people play 2D as "waiting", meaning it basically is almost an automatic response to 2C. The reason that is popular is that it takes up the least amount of bidding room, and allows the 2C opener a lot of room to describe her hand. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play that 2D promises at least one Ace or King, and that 2H shows a "bust" hand, no Aces or Kings. Other people, me included play "2nd negative", with a bust hand you bid 2D and then bid your cheapest minor to show a bust hand. So, the auction for example of 2C-2D-2H-3C, shows that responder has a bust hand if you play 2nd negative.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another approach some people use is steps where responses to 2C either shows points ( 2D shows 1-3, 2H shows 4-6 points, etc) or controls (2D shows no more than 1 King, 2H shows 2 Kings or 1 Ace, 2S shows an Ace and a King, and 2N shows 3 Kings. I do not like step responses personally. They take up extra bidding room and often wrong side the contract.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer bidding 2D over 2C most of the time because that gives the 2C openers the most room to describe their hand. One other comment on the bidding on this hand. Patti should strongly consider 3N over my 3C bid. Even with a void, 3N is often the best contract. 9 tricks are often easier than 10.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|^B@2
robzim: Even without transportation?|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Patti doesn't need transportation, as most of the tricks are in her hand. In this board you don't need the clubs, just a stopper so the opponents can't run them. |

ELIZA42: No I play the reverse of the standard. Thus, you bid 2NT with poor club suit.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we discussed these last week, but let's go over 4 way transfers again. If you play 2S is a transfer to clubs and 2N is a transfer to diamonds, the NT opener has some options--hence it is called "pre-accept." Over 2S, there are 2 bids he can make, 2N or 3C. Most people play that 2N means the NT opener likes clubs (has 3+ to the A, K, or Q) and 3C means he does not like clubs (denies holding a good club suit). |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, some reverse the meaning as Elizabeth apparently does where 3C means the NT bidder likes clubs, and 2N means he does not. Similarly, over 2D, the standard way to play is that 3C by the NT opener shows 3+ diamonds to an honor, and 3D says NT opener does not have good diamonds. Again, you can reverse those meanings as well if you choose. I prefer the standard meaning. BTW, all those bids are alertable.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if playing standard 4-Way transfers with this hand I would bid 2N. The reason being that you want the NT bidder to play the hand. With bad clubs it is more likely you want to play in clubs. So, by bidding 3C with bad clubs, the NT bidder is declarer. Regardless, here I am playing what Elizabeth plays which is the reverse of standard and bid 3C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Elizabeth made a reasonable try at 3N because I have clubs and her hand is worth 6 tricks. There is a good chance that I have 3 extra tricks in my hand. Although we went down, Elizabeth made a nice bid, and this illustrates one use of 4-Way transfers with pre accepts. Without the K of clubs, we should not play in 3N, but with the K of clubs,  3N is a good bet. In this hand the bad diamond distribution defeated the auction.|

Most players would define a double of 3S as a Negative Double, and would be unwilling to double without 4 hearts. They can't bid 3NT without a spade stopper. Therefore, my guess is that their answers to these three hands would be: 
Hand 18: Bid 4D, Hand 19: Bid 5C, and Hand 20: Bid 4C. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

However, we all were taught to avoid playing 5 of a minor. I'm confident that your experience since then has reinforced that. Should you really throw all that out the window when your RHO preempts? |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|

Good news! There is a solution. When partner opens and your RHO jumps to 3D, 3H, or 3S, I define double as a hand with 10+ HCP that is looking for 3NT. If the doubler had a stopper he would have bid 3NT. Therefore, his double denies a stopper in the opponent's suit. If you delete the six letters in the middle of the phrase "THRee notrUMP", the result is "THRUMP". Therefore, these doubles are referred to as Thrump Doubles. |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

Ever since I first defined a double of 3@D, 3@H or 3@S after partner opens as a Thrump Double, they have proved to be invaluable in getting to 3NT. In fact, unless your opponents agree to stop preempting, or you become enamored of playing in 5 of a minor, I would not want to play bridge without THRUMP Doubles. |
