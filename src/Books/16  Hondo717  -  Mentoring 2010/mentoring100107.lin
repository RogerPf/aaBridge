UP|33|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets talk about the auction, because both Dee and I were optimists. I have 7 hcp plus 1 length point = 8 Sarting Points. Once Dee bids spades  I can add two points for my doubletons for a total of  10 points, just enough for a limit raise. I almsot bid  a constructive raise, since my hand didnt really "feel" like a limit raise, but I decided to play it straight.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's count Dee's Bergen Points. She has 19 starting points--16 HCP, two length points, and one quality suit. Once I raise spades, she can then add two for the singleton and one for the sixth spade. So, she has 22, which means slam is possible, since I have 10-12. Therefore, it was reasonable for her to try for slam.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let me talk about a convention which I have never talked about before, known as "serious 3N" because it applies to this hand nicely. If Dee bids 3N over 3C, that says "I am serious about bidding slam pard, and you must make a control bid." However, if she bids 4C over 3C, as she did, that says "I am thinking about slam pard, but I am not sure. I only want you to make a control bid if you think we might have slam."|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had we been playing 3N, if she chooses to bid 4C, and I bid 4S, then she should pass, because I am saying that I don't have slam interest. On the other hand, if she bids the "serious 3N", then I have to bid 4D, as she is saying "I don't care what you have, just make a control bid." Now on this hand as we are not playing the convention, if Dee wanted to be optimistic, she can just bid 4N. She has all the suits controlled, so she should not be afraid of the 5 level. Then, when she finds out we are missing 2 key cards, we stop in 5S. That turns out to go down as well. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dee_dee_20: With this hand after my 4C you bid 4S which I must pass.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes Dee, if you bid 4C, and I say, "sorry not interested" you should pass. otherwise you are not being consistent.|

UP|28|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first talk about the auction, then a little about the play. A NT bid in balancing seat shows 11-14. Since I am a passed hand, I can have no more than 12. I had a problem over 1H and I did not want to let them play it there, but I did not have a good balancing bid. I could double, and then correct 1S to 1N I suppose. But I decided just to lie a little bit and just bid 1N. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I did not want Dee to think I had much in spades, and if I make a balancing double, she has a right to assume I have at least 3 spades. When you make a balancing double, you don't need 4 of the other major, but you should have at least 3.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, once I lead spades, particularly since I bid 1N,  Dee should assume I am trying to cut down on ruffs in dummy. So, she should just play back another spade. It turns out not to matter on this hand, but I did choose a defense, and unless she has a good reason to override me, which she does not, she should continue with the defense I have chosen.|

UP|28|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a couple of comments on the play first. First, Patti should continue to draw trumps, because she should be worried about a heart ruff. Second, at trick five Dee did not cash her 2nd spade, choosing to play a heart instead, so Roberta should cooperate. It is sort of the same principle as last hand, where I said Dee should cooperate with my defense and lead a spade back. If partner chooses a defense, stick with it unless there is a good reason not to.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about 4 way transfers. Their official name is "4 way transfers with pre-accepts." When you play 4 way transfers, that means 2S over 1N is a transfer to clubs, and 2N over 1N is a transfer to diamonds. So, the first thing to remember is you better have a good partner, because if you don't then they will forget that 2N is a diamond transfer and you will end up in some ugly 2NT  contracts. For that reason, I usually recommend you don't play 4 way transfers.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However for this hand, let's assume you are playing them. You will notice, unlike with the major suit transfers, there is an extra bid before the transfer suit. By that I mean, over 2S, 2N is available to the 1N opener in addition to 3C. Similalry, 3C is available over the 2N diamond transfer, in addition to 3D. So, you can make use of them to show whether or not you like the transfer suit.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You "like" the suit if you have 3+ cards with the A, K, or Q. Otherwise you don't like the suit. So, if you don't like the suit, you bid the transfer suit. Simply said, you just need good cards in the transfer suit to like it. In this case, if I did not like diamonds I would bid 3D. If you do like the suit, you bid one below the transfer suit. In this case, I liked diamonds, so I bid 3C. This allows Patti to bid 3D, as she did, if all she wants to do is play 3D.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
robzim: So, 2NT is the super-accept over 2S? |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I wouldn't call it "super accept" The official term is "pre-accept" but if you like super accept that is fine. The reason for the pre-accept is, say Patti had KQxxxx of diamonds, then she might want to bid 3N with some hands, knowing that we had six diamond tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already talked about super accepts. The only other issue is Dee's play on the 2nd club--trick 8. Normally, as you know, 2nd hand low is correct. As I say, if you always follow that rule, you will come out way ahead. However, in this case, Dee can figure out it can't hurt to cover.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, leading unprotected Aces is a bad idea, but since they avoided 3N, I am going to do it. However, just like with my 2nd hand low rule, if you never lead an unprotected Ace on opening lead, you will come out ahead in the long run. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets talk about the play first. Patti has a club loser and spade loser for sure. So, she has to hope hearts are 3-3. If they are then the contract makes, if not then is down. Therefore, before playing trumps, she should play AK and a low heart. Once hearts break she is all set.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding. As a general rule, you should avoid playing 5 of a minor if 3N is at all possible. Dee does have a tough problem over 3D. I would bid 3S with her hand, and hope Patti can bid 3N. It does turn out 3N is down 1, because Patti only has 8 tricks. But at least 3S gives you a chance to play 3N. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4H is probably the best contract, and 4 spades is ok as well. If Dee bids 3S, then Patti might very well choose 4S with Jx. In summary, avoid 5 of a minor in favor of 3N or 4 of a major.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a good illustration of defensive signalling. I did have 7 hearts, but they were so weak, even I decided 2H was sufficient and it did work out. Now, let us discuss Dee's 2 spade bid. Dee has a problem over 2H. My suggestion is a negative double. she is just a tad weak to bid 2S. Then, Patti should probably bid 2N over the negative double, hoping that Dee has some diamonds, and figuring on a heart lead. The negative double only promises spades, not diamonds. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It promises at least 4 spades, you could have more spades if you have a hand that is too weak to bid 2S. Again, let me excplain. Negative double only promises the unbid major, and either tolereance for partner or the other suit. So, I think that is the best sequnce. On the othher hand, 4S is an ok contract with better distribution. It is just a problem due to all the voids. The weird distribution did you in. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It used to be my students were not aggessive enough. I think I have trained them too well, lol. May have to reverse the trend. On the surface 6C was a reasonable contract. However, on this auction, it was a little less unlucky. On the other hand, since Ira showed a 5/5 or more major suit hand, Ally can expect bad splits. So, it was not quite as unlucky as it seemed, but it still was unlucky. Having said that, lets go back to the auction. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not a big fan of bidding 2N over 1 of a minor, particularly when playing weak NT. It takes up a lot of room, and can often wrong side the contract. With Bruce's hand, I would bid 1D over 1C  and with 4 clubs and 10 or more, I would choose 2C rather than 2N. Now, if it goes 1C-1D, Ally has an interesting problem. She has a game forcing hand but no good bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose Bruce bid 1D with six or seven points. Take away just his Ace of hearts. Your hand is not good enough to bid 5 of a minor opposite a weak hand which is why you have a problem.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first the auction. Many people would not bid 1H with the West's hand. But, my wife ava would have just as Bruce did. However, my rule is, if you bid the suit, partner must lead it. Therefore, you as a partnership have to decide. Further, even if you decide Bruce can overcall 1H, it should only be done at the one level, the two level is too dangerous.|

PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would personally pass with your hand Bruce. So, it is really a matter of style, and whether you care if Ally leads a heart, and are willing to accept the risk that she will get off to the wrong lead vs the gain of competing. It is not clear one way or the other. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1S is fine, and Ally's cue bid is a limit raise. Cue bid was fine, as was my "stolen bid" double. Now, the question is over the double, what should Bruce do. What is the difference between pass and bidding 3H. Some would say 3H is the weakest bid Bruce can make, that pass is stronger. The idea being that with a weak hand, Bruce wants to preempt us. Others would say that pass is weaker than 3H, 3H is invitational. Each partnership has to decide. I suspect that it is easier to remember if pass is weaker than 3H. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ally has a choice of two cue bids (2d or 2s) to show a limit raise. To most people there is no difference between cue bidding the opener (2D here) or cue bidding the responder (2S here). But some people play that on that auction 2D would be a limit raise with three card support, and 2S would be limit with four card support. And, there are others who use Ally's approach of I would rather jam the opponents. I use the 3 card/4 card approach myself. So, with Ally's hand I would bid 2S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, we need to discuss how to ask for Aces in this auction. If you play Gerber, you must define when you use Gerber sequences. I play Gerber only in the following four cases:
1) opener bids 1NT; 
2) Opener bids 2NT 
3) 2N rebid by opener; and
4) 2C followed by 2N rebid |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not think 4NT as a quantitative bid has any value. The difference between making 6NT and not is almost never a matter of exactly how many high card points you have, but rather whether you have a source of tricks (such as a solid 5+ card suit). So to bid 4NT, asking partner to bid 6NT with 16 or 17, does not make sense. Regardless, you and your partner need to decide when 4@C is Gerber, and you need to be precise. Otherwise 4@C would be ambiguous. |
