^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we will get to the 2C question in a second. But let's talk about this particular auction. First we will talk about Kerrie's bid. then hope's. What you should bid over the double Kerrie is 2S. Nada is showing hearts and spades. The rule is if there are 2 suits remaining on the way to NT, you bid the suit you have. 2S by Kerrie would show spades and deny hearts. But, regardless, 2N is a bit risky. Your other choices are pass and 3C. Pass is probably best. If you pass, Eddy bids 2H and I bid 2S (showing spades, asking about hearts), and then you can bid 3C. We might even stay out of 5C which is down 1.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about what Nada should do. She has 4 choices. One is to double as she did. The other is to bid 3C (or 3D)--Michaels. The third is to bid 2H. The best of all is as Eddy suggested, 2D. My general rule is, unless I am planning on doubling and correcting, is to not make a takeout double with a 5 card major. So, even if the auction goes, say 1C-P-1D-?, if I am 5/4 in the majors I will bid my 5 card major. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with a takeout double is partner will never play you for a 5 card suit. My feeling is you should prefer overcalling a 5 card major to doubling, even when you have the other major. On this hand Michaels is fine. But on other hands, my recommendation is to overcall rather than doubling. |

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. The opening lead was heart three, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board.

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, although we can discuss the play. I think the bidding is more useful to discuss. Eddy is just shy of an opening hand. So, when pard opens 1H, he has a problem. His hand becomes worth 13 dummy points--10 HCP, 1 long suit + 2 doubletons. Now, depending on what you play, he has several choices. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play Drury, you are all set. Because Eddy can bid 2D (4 card limit raise), and then bid game. If you still play Bergen Raises, then Eddy can bid 3C (reverse) or 3D (regular) as limit raise, and also raise 3H to 4H. The only problem is if they play neither, Eddy should not bid 3H as a limit raise. Because he wants to play in 4H.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |

esprit12: West may try slam?|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She may, but it is only down on a spade lead. Hand should always make 5. Aanyway, one of the advantages of Bergen is when you have a "strong" llimit raise. Then you can make a limit raise, and then raise 3 of the major to 4 of the major.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most frequent time that occurs is when partner opens a major and you have 5 card support and 10-12 dummy points. That is a perfect hand to make a limit bergen raise and then raise 3 to 4. Much better than just jumping to 4 because if pard has a really strong hand, you have a better chance at getting to six.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
barbhow: So, is Bergen raise always on after a passed hand?|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't play Drury, it should be on. If you do play Drury, then it is off. The point is, either play Bergen is on by a passed hand, or play Drury. I prefer not playing Drury. BTW, that is the reason I still play 1N forcing even by a passed hand, again assuming you don't play Drury. Because if you have the 3 card limit raise after a major suit opener, if you don't play forcing NT by a passed hand, you can't bid your hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, I will plan. Off the top, I have 2 hearts 1 spade, 2 clubs, and 1 diamond, for six tricks. Also, the odds of my getting 4 diamond tricks is very high. All it takes is either a 2-2 break or a singleton honor. I am not sure of the exact odds, but I would guess it exceeds 75%.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, I will play the Ace of diamonds and a small diamond. I think 75% is a bit low. The point is, you are a big favorite to make 4 diamond tricks. |

vanyvon: Using the finesse would increase your odds I think.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have only one entry to the board and can only finesse once. Regardless, I have been informed by genious kibitzers that the odds of my taking 4 diamond tricks is only 65% pretty much the same as a 3-2 break (ok, for you purists, a couple of percent less, lol).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's first talk about my 2C bid. There are some considerations. I think the hand is too strong to open 1D. I also hate to open 2C and then rebid 3D over 2D because that takes up too much room. Therefore, my two choices are to open 2N or to open 2C followed by 2N. I have 22 HCP and a 5 card suit, so I decided to bid 2C followed by 2N (22-24). But my long suits are mediocre and my Jack of spades is somewhat dubious. If someone chose to open 2N, that would be okay.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had a spade been led, I would be forced to play East for Kx of diamonds. But with a heart lead, I still have a spade stopper so the way I played the diamond suit is reasonable. If I had 2 entries to dummy, then 2 finesses would be fine. In fact, I guess the best way to play the hand is different than what I did. Now that I think about it the best way to play for 4 diamond tricks is play the Ace of diamonds. If an honor falls, I am all set.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If an honor does not fall, then cross to the King of clubs and lead a diamond off dummy. That way only fails if west has KJx of diamonds, and the way I play it fails also. So, had I played it correctly, I would have increased my odds dramatically.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Several weeks ago during one of his mentoring sessions there was a passed out hand. I was not present. However, Howrad and the paticipants wondered whether I can make anything out of a passed out hand. It obviously was a good natured remark. Not so for me. I take the job very seriously. For the first time since that board I get to rise to the challenge with flying color.  Personally, I believe that I made a great learning board out of a pass out hand. Now, I am looking forward  to another challenge guys.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have opened the North hand, as it meets the rule of 20, even using Bergen adjusted HCP. Let me briefly discuss the rule of 20 in conjunction with Bergen hand evaluation. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule of 20 says if the sum of your "|CP|8|at|Traditional HCP|CP||AT|" plus the length of your two longest suits is 20 or more, you should open. |CP|8|at|Traditional HCP|CP||AT| as you know is based on Ace=4, King=3, Queen=2 and Jack=1. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


at| Here North's hand has 12 Traditional HCP. |HC|HKCADKQ|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


lc|HKCADKQ|AT| That plus five cards in spades |HC|St8732|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT| and four cards in diamonds |HC|DKQ54|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT| is 21 which is more than enough for Rule 20. |LC|HKCADKQ54St8732|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what if you use Bergen's hand evaluation . As you know in that method the the value a hand before any bidding is the Starting Points. That value (Starting Points) is the raw HCP + adjustments for dubious shortness + adjustments for quality suits + adjustments for Adjust3 and + the adjustment for length. For Rule 20 Bergen is using |CP|8|at|Adjusted HCP|CP||AT| instead of |CP|8|at|Traditional HCP|CP||at|.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|How do we get the |CP|8|at|Adjusted HCP|CP||at| you may ask. The answer is simple. Adjusted HCP is basically your Starting Points minus the adjustment for length points (the length points are taken into account by using the length of your 2 longest suits). So adjusted HCP equals raw HCP + adjustments for dubious shortness + adjustments for quality suits + adjustments for adjust3. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us look at North's hand again. It has 11 |CP|8|at|Adjusted HCP|CP||at|--12 raw HCP + zero for quality suits, minus 1 for dubuious shortness (stiff @HK) and plus zero for Adjust3. 11 with 9 cards in spades and diamonds equals 20 which is enough to open 1S using rule 20 if you use Bergen's hand evaluation. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's first discuss the 2N opener. It is somewhat similar to a couple of hands ago where I opened 2C followed by 2N and I think 2N has some merit. However, in this case I personally would probably have opened 1D. I felt the previous hand was too strong to open 1D with 22 HCP. In tht hand, although I was 2-2 in the majors, I had stoppers in both majors. This hand has several flaws for opening 2N, although as I said, 2N is certainly a very plausible bid. The major flaw is that one of the doubleton majors is unstopped. I am not saying you can't open 2N with a small doubleton. But since you have 2 doubletons, I think it is a tad more dangerous.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The second flaw is it is off shape for a 2N bid. Therefore, because of those flaws, I might choose 1D, but 2N was ok.  Now, as to the play. Eddy can count 4 clubs, 1 spade, 2 hearts, and 1 diamond for sure. That is 8 tricks. He has 2 plays for a 9th trick. and with careful play he can try for both alternatives. Although unfortunately niether happen to work. But, the best way to play the hand is to play AK of clubs first. If clubs are 3-2, he now has 2 club dummy entries. One alternative is to hope North has the Ace of diamonds. If that fails, alternative 2 is the spade finesse. He can play the Jack of clubs to the Queen, such that the 8 of clubs is another dummy entry and then play a diamond.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most Souths won't be as tricky as me, and will take their Ace of diamonds. But assuming the King wins, he can enter dummy again and play another diamond. As it tursn out, since I have a doubleton diamond, he is still ok for the moment. I play back a heart but he still can take the spade finesse. So, although the hand always goes down, that line increases your odds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, Eddy made a very nice 4S bid, and had the right idea on the play. Let's talk about the auction first. Eddy has 2 choices over 1H, 1S or 2H (Michaels). You can argue for either. With a six card spade suit, overcalling 1S has merit. But 2H gets your shape across. However, it does not do justice to your point count as Michaels is often done with a weak hand. So, one could make a case for either 1S or 2H. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3H by Nada was fine and it gave me a problem. I technically have 10 dummy points but my King of hearts is dubious. If it were in any other suit it would clearly be much better. However, I wanted to encourage Eddy to bid 4S over 4H, so I decided to bid 3S, even though I am a bit weak given that my King is in hearts. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to whether Kerrie should bid 4H. The only reason not to bid 4H is tactical--she doesn't want us to bid 4S. By the law, they have a 10 card fit, so 4H is fine. The argument for passing is not that 4H is a bad contract (because by the law it is not). The argument against bidding 4H is that it might push us into 4S where we otherwise might play 3S. On competitive auctions in general, that is something you need to be aware of.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am very wary of bidding 4 of a minor over their major suit. Not because I think 4 of the minor is going down but because I might push them into a making game. That is something tactical you need to think about. A bridge saying is "the 3 level belongs to the opponents." That means, it is ok to compete to the 3 level, but you need to be careful when competing to the 4 level.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. Eddy played the diamond suit very well. The way he played it, if Kerrie ducks the diamond, he can assume East has the King and play the 10. His way of playing the suit gives him the best chance of discovering the best way to play the suit. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I would like to suggest a couple of adustments to the play. At trick five once Kerrie leads a spade, ducking was fine. But on the next spade, he should overtake the 9 with the Queen in hand and ruff a diamond. He can then ruff a heart, draw trump, and claim, losing a club, no matter how diamonds are split. |

PG| ***** 122 ***** |


FP||AT|

^B@2The first building block in Bergen's hand evaluation method is to determine the ^*BStarting Points^*N of a hand.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


FP||AT|

The |FP|2|CP|8|AT|Starting Points|CP||FP||AT| are the sum of "Traditional HCPs", points for "Adjust-3", points for "Length", points for the number of "Quality Suits", and points for the number of "Dubious Doubleton/Singletons" in a hand before the bidding. Let us briefly review each component as outlined in Bergen's publications and Howard's lessons.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


FP|2|CP|8|AT|

Traditional HCPs|CP||FP||AT| in a hand are counted based on the standard formula of A = four points, King = three points, Queen = two points, and Jack = one point. Therefore, this hand|HT|q|cs|2|3d|5|at|^b  {|ih|psj73haKJdQj64cJ83|at|}|HT|t|AT|^k has 13 Traditional HCPs.|HC|sjhakjdqjcj|

^-|HT|f|FP|2|CP|8|AT|
^B@2Adjust-3|CP||FP||AT| is a method to fine-tune the traditional HCP count for the "overrated/underrated honors." Bergen considers the traditional 4-3-2-1 count undervalues the Ace, overvalues the Queen and Jack (the quacks), and does not give any value to the Ten. He believes the following is a more accurate assignment of the values.
^-

{A = 4.5, K = 3, Q = 1.5, J = .75, 10 = .25}
^-|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|^B@2

Therefore, he labels Aces and Tens "undervalued" and Queens/Jacks (quacks) "overvalued". Counting HCPs in that fashion, however, would be a bit awkward so Bergen devised Adjust-3. In Adjust-3 you add one point to the traditional HCPs if the number of Aces/Tens exceeds the quacks by 3 or more but is less than 6. If they exceed by six or more you add two points. However, you subtract from the HCPs if the Quacks exceed Aces/Tens using the same guideline. Thus,|

^B@2Length Points|CP||FP||AT|: According to Bergen's hand evaluation method the value of a hand increases if it contains long suits. A suit in bridge is a 4+ card holding. Therefore, one point is added to the hand's value for each card more than four in all the suits in the hand. For example:|

^B@2Quality Suit Points|LC|S763H73|CP||FP||AT|: With Bergen's hand evaluation method we add one point for each "Quality Suit"--a 4+-card suit containing 3 or more honors. Ten is an honor. For example: |

^B@2Dubious Doubletons/Singletons|CP||FP||AT|: Bergen believes that a singleton King, Queen, and Jack do not have the true value assigned to them by the traditional evaluation method. Further, any doubleton containing a Queen or a Jack has less value (dubious doubleton) unless the Ace is the other card. Therefore, we should deduct one point for every singleton King, Queen, and Jack and any dubious doubleton. For example, the value of|

HT|j|cs|2|3d|5|at|^b  {|ih|ps8743haJ3dkQ96cqJ|at|}|HT|j|AT|^K@2^Y@3the hand on the left is 12 points rather than 13 as a point should be subtracted for the dubious club doubleton.|HC|CQJ|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


HT|t|LC|CQJ|FP|2|AT|^B@2
In summary, to count the Starting Points of a hand, you count the HCPs, adjust for overvalued/undervalued honors, add for length if any, add for Quality Suits if any, and subtract for dubious singletons/doubletons.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


cp|8|fp||AT|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Once a fit is established, the partnership assets go up in value. Bergen accomplishes this by adding extra points to each hand. For the hand that will be the dummy, he adds "Dummy Points". For the hand that will be declarer, he adds "Declarer Points" (which he also calls "Bergen Points"). Let us move to those sections.|

Please note that a "^*B5-card Quality Suit ^*N" is particularly valuable in declarer's hand after a fit. Such holding, originally contributes 1 point for length and 1 point for quality to the Starting Points calculation. Then, after the fit declarer adds another point for a 4+ card side suit. Therefore, a 5-card side suit of good quality adds 3 points to the value of declarer's hand in addition to its Raw HCP.|
