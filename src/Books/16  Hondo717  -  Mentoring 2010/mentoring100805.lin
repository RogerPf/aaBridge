^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hand where the squeeze works except for entry problems. If I run the diamonds first, I am stuck on the board. If I run the clubs first, I have to discard one of my major suit threats. But we will go for the pseudo squeeze which might work if I did not already tell Eddy what was going on, lol. Also, I forgot to take the marked diamond finesse, so busy concentrating on the squeeze :). Regardless, 3N was the correct contract as you can see.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I will bid 3N here, but there are better 15 and 16 counts I could have. I would not be surprised if I went down. A flat 17 with 3 jacks is not a good hand. A 16 point hand with a 5 card suit is much better.|

jlco: Can you explain why isabable bid 2C without a 4 card major? Thanks! :).|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss Kerrie's 2C bid, which may be puzzling some of you.  Kerrie plays 4 suit transfers. What that means is she transfers to clubs by bidding 2S and transfers to diamonds by bidding 2N. So, 1N-P-2N if you play 4 suit transfers is a diamond transfer. Therefore she needs a way to invite when she has a flat 8 or 9. The way she does that is bid Stayman followed by 2N. If you play 2N as diamond transfer, then Stayman does not always guarantee a 4 card major. As far as alerts, in BBO, you should alert immediately. But in a live club, you don't alert the 2C, but you do alert the 2N rebid by Kerrie.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have to think about the hand. I need to take the Ace and try and keep Hope off lead or I can duck the Ace and take all my finesses into Hope. It all depends on who I think has the Ace of spades. If West has the Ace of spades I should take this trick, as I can take all my minor suit finesse into West. If one of them works I have nine tricks because I have either  4 clubs, 3 diamonds 1 heart and 1 spade or 3 clubs 4 diamonds.|

PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well Kerrie, you were a tad light to invite. But I am certainly not one to criticize aggressive bidding :). Typically with 8 points you should have a 5 card suit, or at least a quality 4 card suit i.e. you should have 9 Bergen Starting Points. You have kind of a mediocre 8. So even if I have 17, game is iffy. I think pass is a tad better.|

cp|8|AT|^*B
-- ^*N |cp||at|: First off, Jordan 2NT only applies over a takeout double. If Eddy had doubled, your bid would have been Jordan. And 2nd you don't have the hand for Jordan even if Eddy doubled. You are showing 11-12 with a spade stopper. Granted you also have hearts. Another choice is 2S cue bid, but that is flawed. I like to play 2S promises 4 card support with a limit raise or better. But some people play you can cue bid with 3 card support. However, you have weak 3 card support, and you have good spades so I think 2N is more descriptive.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed the auction. Hope chose a good bid. 2S was another possibility if it showed 3+ card support (it does not the way I play). So, 2N was really her only choice. Now as to the play please notice I led my partner's suit. My rule is I always lead my partner's suit and partner is not allowed to criticize me for doing so :). It is right more often than it is wrong and it leads to partners getting along better. On this hand, if I chose a diamond, it would not have helped anyway.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the defense. A couple of small points. Eddy should duck the first heart for sure, and possibly the second heart. He should wait for me to give count to see how many hearts I have and Hope has. Why? Because by not ducking, he is giving declarer extra entries to the board. If he ducks and sees my 8, he can assume I am starting a high low and started with two. Therefore, he should duck the 2nd round as well, thus cutting communications with dummy.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a minor point on this hand, but could be important on other hands. Further, as to whether Eddy should lead back a spade. I would lead count. It is possible I have 89J. But it is more likely I have a doubleton given that lead. So, a spade back is risky.  I would probably have chosen a club. Of course, if I did have 89J, Eddy is a hero :).|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Hope can count four hearts two spades, one club and two diamonds for sure. Given she does not get a 3rd spade trick, her best play for a 9th trick is the diamond finesse or a 3-3 diamond break which is what she did, so nicely played :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's discuss what Eddy should bid here. I am not so worried about his point count for the takeout double but I definitely prefer 1S to double. On this hand I think it is very clear. Great spades, not so great diamonds. In general, I prefer to show 5 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absolutely. With a double partner will never play me for 5 spades. I always bid 1 of a major with a 5 card suit. Even if both hearts and spades are the unbid suits, and I am 5/4 in the majors, I still prefer to show the 5 card suit.
hondo717: You should think Eddy has 4 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But spades are the higher suit, and partner can raise with 3 if she has 3 card support if you bid spades. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice Hope. Here is a good example of where more aggressive bidding would have helped. I would have bid 1D with Kerrie's hand. Granted, most of the time it would not accomplish much. But on this hand, over 1H, Eddy could bid 2H or 3D and get in our way. In general, bidding is better than passing. Also, we discussed why I think Eddy should bid 1S. That would have allowed Kerrie to compete to 2S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, there is a convention I could have used if Hope played it. It is known as a support redouble. Some people play that if the auction goes, for example, 1C-P-1H-1S, a double by me is known as a "support double." It shows exactly 3 card heart support. 2H in that auction promises 4 card support. The companion convention to that is known as a support redouble. On this auction where East doubled, e.g 1C-P-1H-Double a redouble by me is a "support redouble." It is the same idea as a support double, it shows exactly 3 card heart support. So, that would have been perfect with my hand.|

hope: What do I bid after support double--@C support or 2H?|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After the support double or redouble in this case  you have to bid hearts to let me know you have 5. Remember, you might only have 4 hearts for all I know.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all Kerrie made a very nice pass. Although she has 11 HCP, she can see it is a misfit hand and with misfits, you take fewer tricks than your points would indicate. So, pass was very well considered. As you can see, 2H does not even make despite the 8 card fit. I probably would have opened 3H with Eddy's hand personally. But that doesn't work out well either.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's discuss Hope's 1N bid. Given our agreement, it is certainly reasonable. However, I recommend the sandwich NT instead. It is rare when both opponents bid that you have a strong NT. And even if you do, it is very likely partner does not have much. So, playing 1N as natural after both opponents have bid is not really all that useful. Instead, you can play the "sandwich NT." If you play that it shows the other 2 suits, and differs from a takeout double as it tends to show a weaker hand and it tends to emphasize the unbid minor rather than major. In this case, there were 2 unbid minors so that would not apply. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, if for example, the auction went 1D-P-1H-1N, that would show less than an opening hand with clubs and spades. No more than 4 spades and would say all things being equal, you prefer clubs, often you would have 5, although not guaranteed. However, the sandwich NT rarely comes up, so I just was telling you about it as a point of interest.|

hope: What would be my bid then?|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your bid would be pass Hope. It is barely possible we have a club fit, but looks like a misfit. So, despite your good hand, I would pass as you have no good bid. And if you had, they still end up in 2H down 1. It is hard to pass with 15, but believe it or not, sometimes I do recommend that you pass, lol. Not very often though. |

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
