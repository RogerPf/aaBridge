{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's start with Ally's overcall. I think it is fine, the only downside is partner will lead spades if they are defending. On the other hand you should lay claim to the spade suit when you can. At the one level, I think it is okay to overcall with a bad 5 card suit, although not everyone agrees. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For my bid, I had a choice of pass, negative double, or diamond raise. With 5 diamonds and a bad hand, I thought the preemptive raise was the best tactic. I would not quarrel with a negative double, but because they have spades, they can outbid us. Had Ally overcalled hearts and I had spades, then a negative double makes more sense tactically, because then we can outbid them. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Soupy should worry about whether to bid 3 or 4. If his King of diamonds was in another suit, hearts for example, then I probably recommend 4. But with it being in diamonds I think 3 is a good bid. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the defense, it is hard for Elizabeth to read that I have a singleton, but she should not think I have 4. I have 5 diamonds, and 2 or 3 spades. Ally did not bid hearts and is unlikely to have more than 4 and probably 3. So, I have 3 or 4 hearts and could be 2-3-5-3 possibly, which would give Ally 2 clubs. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given my lead, I might have three. I can't have two, because I led the 4 and Elizabeth can see the three and two. Therefore, I either have one or three. So, although Elizabeth does not know for sure what I have, an expert partner who counts out the hands might figure out I have one.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lots to discuss both bidding and play. Even assuming you play light openers, I strongly prefer 2D over 1D by West. It is much more descriptive as well as preemptive. Partner is a passed hand, so there is no chance you have game and might as well make it difficult for the opponents.  |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also do not agree with Elizabeth's double. Unless you are planning to double and correct, you need to be at least 4-3 in the majors. Sometimes you can be 3-3 with two good 3 card suits, but 2-3  does not cut it. Neither her suit nor her hand are good enough for a double and correct. Further, 2C is somewhat preemptive. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ally's redouble was fine. My 3 hearts should show a moderate hand with long hearts. I am counting on partner to have at least three. My diamond void is golden as is my Ace of spades. I almost have a 4 heart bid. And I would not blame someone if they bid 4 which is why double by Elizabeth can work out very badly. She can bid 2C or 1N, although her diamond stopper is iffy, she is hoping I have the Queen at least. Pass is okay too. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play I am in great danger of losing control of this hand, by having the opponents make me ruff diamonds. So, I want to set up clubs before drawing any trumps. I was also hoping the situation was the way it was. West should duck the Ace of clubs, as he has no reason to think I have 5 clubs. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Ally should ruff, it is reasonable for her to think I have the Ace of clubs. However, she knows she has 2 natural trump tricks  and that argues against ruffing. Usually, you should avoid ruffing with natural trump tricks unless you are trying to prevent declarer from pitching. But that was not the case here. Although I understand why she ruffed, she should think twice about it. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand also illustrates a principle that all good declarers understand and that is that defenders often have difficulty knowing what you have. Sometimes they can be induced into making a mistake. I am not saying you should declare assuming they will make a mistake. But in this case I had to knock out the Ace of clubs anyway, so I played it deceptively. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The club void is extremely powerful, and as you can see, the hand can be made. Taking the spade finesse was very reasonable. However once it loses, Ally should maximize her chances. After the second club, her only potential loser is a diamond. She may be able to set up hearts, so that is what she should try after playing the 2nd spade--(trick four spade). |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once that spade wins, and I show out she should play heart to the King and heart back to the Ace and ruff a heart, if the Q does not drop. If that does not work, she can always try the diamond finesse. That maximizes the chances. Elizabeth's 5C bid was excellent as well, BTW. She can count us for 10 trumps, and with no defense, at favorable vul, 5 clubs must be a good sacrifice. Although it does turn out I am down 4, taking only my 7 club tricks but I think the bid is a nice one.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another interesting hand and honest, these are random, not prearranged. It turns out the winning bid by West is double of 3D, but that is impossible to find which is another argument for preempting, because, even when double works out, it is difficult for the opponents to find the proper contract. West has a clear 3H bid with his hand. I think Ally should bid 3N with her hand and hope that they can scramble and take 9 tricks. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner then pulls to 4H, she can correct to 4S. Her diamonds are probably not worth much in spades, but they have some value in NT. On the other hand, I don't think they do much better in 3N as it turns out because transportation between the hands is difficult. Now, the most important point I want to make is on opening leads which is the first topic of my upcoming course on defense. Next, is a preview of the first lesson. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here are some rules that I believe in. The most important is "you never lose the post mortem by leading partner's suit" I just about always lead partner's suit. On occasion it is wrong, but it is usually right or makes no difference. And partner knows when I don't lead his suit, I probably have a void, or a singleton in the suit that I did lead. So, I strongly recommend you always lead partner's suit if you can. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Obviously Elizabeth could not in this case. However, she did violate another rule of mine. It is that it is rarely right to lead the opponent's suit (not counting trumps). So, a heart lead should be her last choice.  All she is doing is setting up the opponents suit. On this auction, Ally is likely to be shorter in hearts than spades. Therefore, I would have led a trump with Elizabeth's hand. A club would be okay. But a heart is not okay since West bid hearts.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ELIZA42: I knew camilleln didn't have many spades therefore has fewer hearts.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, lead a trump since you have heart tricks and use your A and K to capture honors from West. Often when declarer is two suited, a trump lead is right.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should Ally do? I think pass is probably best with Ally's hand. Typically, a new suit by responder to a balance shows a 5 card suit. I play it is forcing even over an overcall, but many do not. I think on this hand, game is unlikely. With a hand good enough for game, Soupy probably would have doubled and correct. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


mb|1S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I passed earlier, I can bid 2D, because partner knows I have a weak hand and won't get too excited. Then, Soupy has a tough decision. with three spades, he has a clear raise. and AK certainly is the best doubleton he could have, so I think 2S is reasonable.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. South opened with diamond Queen, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board.  |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's count my Bergen Dummy points. I have 18 Dummy Points: 11 HCP, two length points, three for singleton spade with 4 trumps, one point for doubleton diamond, and one points because Aces/Tens exceed the quacks-two Aces and one ten with no quacks. My spade singleton is not necessarily a full asset but my points are more than enough to bid game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well on that hand, the Bergen Point count was a tad aggressive. It takes the J of hearts on side and a 3-2 heart break to make the hand. Not to mention friendly spades. So, at best down one. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My only comment is a minor one, but important one. Elizabeth should not have cashed the 2nd club. The spade pitch did her no good. By retaining the King of clubs, it saves her from having to ruff prematurely. Nevertheless, hands where you have poor trumps are hard to play. Elizabeth's line of play was very reasonable, and if West had the J of hearts, it had plays.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding and play were straight forward. What I would like to discuss is Sandy's opening lead, which was fine. Let me discuss honor leads against NT. Let's save the Ace for later. The lead of the King asks partner to signal positive attitude with the Ace or Jack or Queen. It is typically done from KQ10 or KQJ. But sometimes with AKxxx you might choose to lead the King, although I prefer low. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of the King asks for an attitude signal. You signal high with an honor. The lead of the Queen is usually from QJ10 or QJ9 sometimes from AQJxx. Now the lead of the Jack depends on whether or not you play coded 10s and 9s. If you do not play coded 10s and 9s, you lead Jack from J109, J108, KJ10, or AJ10. So, playing standard leads, Dee in this hand would lead the Jack of clubs on opening lead-if she were to lead. |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts prefer coded 10s and 9s, which helps them figure out if partner has KJ10 or AJ10 or not. If you play coded 10s and 9s, then you have to lead J only from J109 or J108. Playing coded, the lead of the Jack denies anything higher. From AJ10 and KJ10, playing coded, you lead the 10. Some people say that shows "0 or two higher" but in fact it is a bit more complicated than that. It often shows KJ10 or AJ10. It also is done from 109xxx. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It either shows a broken sequence with the J10, or it shows nothing higher than the 10, partner can usually figure it out. The reason for playing coded 10s is that the J denies a higher honor, so it is easier for partner to figure out leader's exact holding playing coded 10s. Coded 9s are similar, they either show nothing higher than the 9, or a broken sequence with the 109, e.g. A109 or K109 or Q109. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, the lead of the Ace in NT is rare but it does have a special meaning. It is typically done from an almost solid suit, often AKJ. It asks partner to pitch an honor (K, Q, or J) most often the Q. You want partner to unblock. If partner has no honor then she gives count. To summarize, King asks for attitude, Ace asks for unblock or count and in real life you usually lead fourth best.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
