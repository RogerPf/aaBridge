lb|*bPlease choose your bid before the actual player does^^1d|cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first question is, should West open 1N or not. Hands with 16 or 17 points are hard to show. However, with 2 doubletons in the majors, I don't like opening 1N, but one could certainly make an argument for it. So, 1D is the bid here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, the question is what to do over the 1S bid. 2C is a slight underbid.  Again the problem with 16 and 17 point hands. Granted, the fifth diamond makes the hand worth 18 Starting Points. Further, the hand has more Aces/tens than quacks. So we give 19 Starting Points to West. Therefore, 2N is a good bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Dorothy has 13 HCPs and a 5-card suit giving her 14 Starting Points, And West showing 18-19 Points, that is just enough for slam. However, most of the time, slam will be iffy, so I would probably content myself with 3N. Further, 6N is the hardest slam to make. it is almost always easier to play in a suit slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very well played. Very interesting hand to bid. Let me say, that although the slam made, it was not particularly good. It turns out 6D is a pretty good contract, because you can afford to lose a diamond. If you look at West's hand, you just have to figure out what to do with the 2 club losers. You can ruff one in dummy, and still only lose 1 diamond, assuming a 3-2 break. So you either have to hope that spades break 3-3 or take the club finesse. All in all, I would put a diamond slam at about 50%, which means if you bid it, you will break even in the long run. 6N on the other hand is not. But, anyway, that validates Marty's point count system.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the bidding was fine. The only two reasonable bids by North are 2N showing 12-14 with hearts, or 2C. And I like 2N better, since the clubs are so weak. As to whether peekaboo should bid 1H or 2H. If I have a Weak-2, I tend to bid two. But once there is an opening bid, it becomes more risky, because one of the opponents has already shown a strong hand. So, some people prefer to have a better suit, although not me.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now to the play. We already discussed leading pard's suit which beats the hand pretty much off the top, unless Elizabeth is psychic and guesses the stiff King of clubs.However, on the club lead, I think the hand can be made. She can count two clubs, four diamonds, one H and three spades and only needs two spades. So, once the clubs are continued at trick 3, if she just starts on diamonds, she has 9 tricks. Because even if East gets in with the King of spades, she has no hearts to lead back. I think that is the best way to play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass was definitely Elizabeth's best bid, and perfect defense will beat it two. However, it is very hard to play perfect defense. They may not even make 3H, so they are probably getting a good score here in any case. Anyway, here was a case where the preempt did not work, although many would preempt with my hand in 3rd seat. And some East would not pass and some West would not double. So, congrats to East and West on good bidding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Patti's sequence is similar to opening 2N, except she is showing 22-24 rather than 20-21 and that means that the same systems apply, Stayman, Transfers, Texas, etc. It's basically as if she opened 2N, except for the different number of points. Roberta was worried about the diamond void. It certainly could be a problem in NT, but you really need not worry too much about it. Once there is no heart fit, it is possible that 5 clubs makes and 3N doesn't, but not often. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, you should avoid bidding 5 of a minor unless you are absolutely positively sure they have a suit to run. Some rubber bridge players have a rule that if they bid 5 of a minor, they might as well bid six. That is a little extreme, but it gets the point across.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few comments on the bidding first. We have to teach Roberta that pass should not be her favorite bid :). And teach Dee that pass maybe should be her favorite bid, lol. Finally, I see Patti has adopted the Howard's "Who cares about a stinking 4 card major" Weak-2 philosophy. I am surprised Dee passed, but with heart cards and not that great a hand think it is fine. Now, what should Roberta do. She might want to balance, in case Dee had a good hand with no bid. However, if she doubles and Dee bids clubs, that is a problem. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, bidding 3D with a suit lacking high honors, is a risk as well. But, her lack of heart honors is a plus. So. I would bid, either double, and tell partner I "owe" her a club, lol, or 3D especially not vul. But, as I said, pass could be right as well. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a treatment some people play known as "equal level conversion doubles"  which works really well on this hand. It basically says if you double, and partner bids the lowest unbid suit, and you correct to the next higher unbid suit, that is not a double and correct. It simply says, you had the 2 higher unbid suits, and no good bid. That works okay on this hand in terms of the bidding, since if you play that, Roberta could correct 3C to 3D, to show a hand with diamonds and spades. That is an advanced treatment, that I do not recommend.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, let me discuss the play as we movie forward. The correct spade back is the 9, to show remaining count.  You lead back your remaining count. So, with three cards left in spades, you lead low spade back. With two left you would lead high.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether you should ruff the club with the 10. You might as well. The 10 is not taking a trick, and if Dee has a good spot like the 9 or 7, it might set up a trick for her. Marty Bergen's March lesson is on establishing trump tricks on defense, and ruffing with the 10 is one technique. That play is known as an "upper cut".  It forced a high trump from Patti without causing Dee to have to play a trump.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Patti is making a control bid. She is showing first or 2nd round control in spades, either A, K, or singleton or void. She is also denying a diamond control because she bypassed diamonds. If she had a diamond control she has to bid it first. You bid cheapest control first.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Patti showing club King. There are two ways to respond to RKCB 5N. One way, which I play, is ## of Kings. So, 6C would be zero King, 6D one King, etc.. Not counting the K of hearts of course, since that was counted in the response to 4N. The other way, which Patti plays is "specific kings." If you play that, then Patti bids the cheapest side suit in which she has a King. In this case she is showing the King of clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, Patti bypassed diamonds when she started her control bid. Therefore, I know she does not have the King of diamonds, so I should be happy to stay in six. I will explain the difference between specific King and ## of Kings afterward.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, so lets count our tricks. There are six hearts, one spade for sure, one diamond for sure, and three clubs. My 12th trick can either be a spade, which is a sure thing, if I play low assuming no singleton in roberta's hand, which may be likely. Or a diamond ruff, after pitching 2 spades on clubs. If I were in seven, would have an interesting choice here. But would probably just rely on diamond finesse in seven. And even here if the spade works, I still need the diamond finesse for 7, so might as well take the spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On some hands, specific Kings work better. On others ## of Kings. When originally invented by the Italians, they liked specific Kings, but Eddy Kantar, who popularized RKCB in the US, introduced ## of Kings. I like ##, but on some hands specific works better.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. The opening by West was spade two. However, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next section covering King ask using Blackwood.  |

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once the Blackwood bidder receives a response to 4N, he may then bid 5N as a king ask. There are two variations to the K response. The variation I have a preference for is to respond with the number of kings (obviously not counting the K of trumps).|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

- 6@C = 0 kings, 
- 6@D = 1 king, 
- 6@H = 2 kings, 
- 6@S = 3 kings. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|

The other variation is "specific kings". If you play that, then you respond with the cheapest suit in which you have an outside K; if you do not have an outside K, you bid six in the agreed upon trump suit. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

The main complication playing specific kings is if your specific king is in a suit higher than the agreed upon trump suit. I play that you should respond with your specific king even in that case (partner needs to be prepared for that response), but some people play you can only respond with a specific king if it is in a suit lower than your agreed upon trump suit.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT|

Also, most people play that if the Blackwood bidder bids 5N as a king ask, that guarantees your side has all 5 key cards. That allows the responder, on rare occasions, to bid seven if he has a hand with an undisclosed feature that will most likely allow seven to make (such as a long solid side suit, which will generate many tricks).|
