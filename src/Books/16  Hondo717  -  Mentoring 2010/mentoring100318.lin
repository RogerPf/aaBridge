^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the auction. Many people would bid 1S with my hand. But, the correct way to bid the hand with 5 card minor and 4 card major and game forcing values is to bid the minor first. Now, as to what North should bid over 2C. I play that 2S is still a reverse, showing extra values. However, many people who play 2 over 1 do not play that as a reverse. Each partnership has to decide. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The advantage of playing it as a reverse is that you can get to slam with 16 opposite 16 more easily, which normally is hard to do. The disadvantage is you sometimes have a rebid problem, as Patti did. On occasion she will have to rebid 2H with a 5 card suit, or bid 2N with a singleton as she did.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Therefore, you just have to make the tradeoff. Should you just be able to bid your shape without worrying about a reverse issue, or should you be able to show a stronger hand?  I favor the reverse showing a stronger hand theory, but bidding your shape has its merits as well.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let's talk about the double. Dee does not have a bad double on the surface, although we did freely bid our game. However, by doubling she pinpointed how to play the hand. Please note 2N does not deny spades if you play 2S shows a reverse. That is one thing you have to consider when doubling the opponents. You may cost yourself a trick or two by pinpointing the play. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was also lucky the Queen of clubs dropped. I figured I was probably down one. Further, I hope you noticed how I handled the spade spots. I made sure I could overtake the spade in my hand for the last finesse. That is part of planning the hand. |

UP|37|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a question as to what I recommend for preempting in first seat. Those of you who have been following my lessons for a long time already know the answer. I think you should preempt with any excuse, particularly at favorable vulnerability. That means if you have a 7 card suit, of any quality, and not an opening hand, you should preempt. But some people feel you need at least 2 honors. It is really a risk reward decisions. I think the rewards for preempting far outweigh the risks. Even if it turns out the bid theoretically won't work out, often times the opponents save you anyway.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people have different guidelines for different seats. One interesting guideline that has merit is that your preempts in second seat should be sound. The reason for that is because your right hand opponent has passed and hence does not have a good hand. Therefore, the likelihood that your partner has a good hand is increased. For that reason, you are more likely to be preempting your partner in second seat. Further, the argument is that if partner can count on you for a solid preempt in second seat, he can better judge what to do. I love to preempt so much that I don't follow that rule. But it has merit for sure.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One comment on Dee's opening lead. I had a recent discussion with Marty Bergen about leading singletons and he said something very interesting. He said that if led a singleton against a suit contract every time he had one, he felt he would have come out ahead even if it was the opponent's suit and even if it was an honor. He is not advocating you always lead a singleton, but is saying it often is a strong lead. Of course not a singleton trump, just another suit. I suspect he would have led the three of spades with Dee's hand, as opposed to the Jack of diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just a few words about the bidding. After 3H bid by Patti, Dee had an interesting dilemma. I don't hate 4H, but with only 2 trumps and no Aces I would probably use the law of total tricks and pass since we only have a 9 card fit. Roberta accidentally made a good lead. It turns out that from that club holding, the Queen is usually the best lead against suits, but had she done that, Patti would have not had any club losers. As I discussed in my leads lesson yesterday, you lead the top of a two card honor sequence against suits. But in this case it would not have worked well. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a couple of points here. You made six. But, since you have the AK of clubs off the top, slam was not a good bid. Now, let's look at Dee's 2S. In any seat but third seat, she is too strong for 2S. Her hand meets the rule of 20, 10 HCP + 10 cards in spades/clubs. However, in 3rd seat, once pard has passed, there is some tactical merit to opening 2S, as it is unlikely you will miss game. So, either 1S or 2S is fine with Dee's hand, but only in 3rd seat.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other general play technique for Roberta. In general, when you are running a suit, proper technique is to play the honors in the shorter hand first. So, at trick two, in hearts, you play the King of hearts first, as that is the short hand  and in diamonds, in trick three, you play the Ace first, as that is the short hand. The reason for that is that it makes it harder to block the suit. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am just giving you the general technique. There are many reasons to deviate but you need to purposely deviate. In diamonds, actually, the correct play is the K of diamonds first, since then you can pick up 4 to the J in either hand. But, the general technique of unblocking honors from the short hand is still right most of the time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally Patti would have made that hand. Let's discuss what to bid over the weak NT. I personally prefer natural with double showing a solid opener at least a good 13. But, on this hand, DONT works better. In balancing seat, you can double with a little less. So, Patti could double and they end up in hearts, which is perhaps a tad better. However, DONT rates to find a better contract on this hand. Usually, in the pass out seat, you should strain to bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let's talk about the auction. Once there is interference, inverted minors are off, since a cue bid is available to show a limit raise. Therefore, Patti has two choices. She can either cue bid 2S to show diamond limit raise or make a negative double. I kind of like the cue bid myself, because she should be thinking about a diamond slam, and they have a likely 9+ card fit. Remember, most of the time, particularly when 1D is opened, opener has 4+ diamonds. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, since Roberta is probably short in spades, it is even more likely she has diamonds. So, Patti is right, to evaluate her hand as 21 Dummy Points in support of diamonds. Thus, 2S is a good bid, and once Roberta bids 3C, which should show extra values, they are off to the races. 3H was an Italian control bid, showing first or 2nd round control of hearts. Further, Patti is too strong to bid splinter and it takes up too much room. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, I like to discuss responses to RKCB with a void. You can decide to ignore the void, but in this case, because the void is in my suit, it should not be ignored. So, if you have a void and want to show it in response to RKCB, you do the following:|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1. With an even number of controls (2 or 4, usually not 0), you bid 5N which shows even ## of controls plus an unspecified void.

2. With an odd number of controls (1 or 3), you bid six of your void if it is below the agreed upon suit. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, had her void been in clubs, Roberta would bid 6C. If the void is above her suit, then you bid six of your suit. In this case, had Roberta bid 6D over 4N, that shows 1 or 3 controls plus a void in hearts or spades. And it would be pretty clear that the void was in spades given this auction. I am not sure Patti should bid 7, although it is not a bad contract, even without the Ace of spades lead. Getting to six was just fine.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Opening lead by South was Ace of spades, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board. |

The Topic for this week is Quick Tricks and is based on  Marty Bergen's ^*ISlam Bidding Made Easier^*N, p 60-61 (Bergen Book 2008). Please visit either Marty Bergen's web site at, ^*Hwww.martybergen.com/^*N or Howard Schutzman's at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/bergenslam.php^*N for additional information on Bergen's books. Further, you can find this topic and many others in Howard's "Slam Bidding Lesson Series" at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/##slamlessons^*N.

^-|HT|f|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3What is Quick Tricks?|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


AT|
Quick Tricks (QT) is the number of tricks you expect to win in a suit on the first two rounds of that suit. Only 2 Quick Trick per suit. Note: Jacks are never "quick."|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT|

How is it done?|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


AT|
Simple. Any Ace gets one, any Ace-King gets two, an Ace-Queen is one and one half, for an King-Queen count one, and one half quick trick for any King-x. So, A=1, AK=2, KQ=1, AQ=1 1/2, and Kx=1/2.|
