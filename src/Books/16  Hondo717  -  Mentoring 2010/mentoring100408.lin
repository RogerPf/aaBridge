{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try. I don't think the hand can be made. However, let's discuss the bidding. The bids through 2H are fine. 3D by Elizabeth shows a fairly strong hand, it is sort of a reverse, in the sense that she is bidding past her suit at the 2 level. So she should either have a lot of points or distribution. She does have distribution. So, 3D is risky but okay. However, once I bid 3N she should pass. She does not want to use her AK of hearts to ruff out clubs. As you already know, I define a reverse as voluntarily bidding past your suit at the 2 level. since 2S was available 3D is a reverse. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I have QJ fifth of hearts she can count six tricks for sure, assuming I have a club stopper and I have the Ace of diamonds, 3N must have plays. And it turns out 3N does make if I duck a diamond early. I will four diamonds, three hearts, a spade, and a club. Against perfect defense it does not make, but if they play perfect defense, then I am allowed to drop the doubleton @DQ and make the hand, lol. So, in real life it will probably make. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to Elizabeth's choices for a rebid. First, it is a hard hand to bid. Bidding 3D takes up a lot of room, so she needs to have a good idea of where the hand is going, or a strong enough hand to handle a 4 level bid. The other choices are 3C and 3H. She has only 2 card support, but the best possible support she can have. In either cases she should pass 3NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me talk about the heart play. Leaving a heart entry was a very good idea. But, the more flexible way of doing so is to leave the Jack of hearts in dummy. That way, you can use an entry to either hand. If you want to get to dummy you can play a low heart to the Jack and if you want to get to South , you can overtake the Jack with the Queen. Not a big deal, but an interesting technique to keep in mind.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets talk about the E/W bidding. By the law of total tricks, Eileen has a 5D bid, since she can count 11 trumps particularly at favorable vulnerability. And it turns out she loses a spade a heart, 2C and a diamond. So, down 3 doubled for -500 as opposed to 680 for making 6H, or 650 for making 5H if she decides to cash the A of clubs(which is not a good play). The law of total tricks works again. Marty Bergen says, ^*B"The law of total tricks is smarter than any bridge player.^*N" and I agree with him.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try. contract could not be made. We will discuss the play in a minute, but first lets analyze the bidding. I would not criticize North for passing 2N but I think that is pessimistic. I hate playing 2N voluntarily. Basically, it is only right when you make exactly 2N, not 3N. So, I tend to strain to bid over 2N openers and I agree with Eileen's bidding. It turns out 4H is not a bad contract. You have two red suit losers so if you can hold your black suit losers to 1, you make the hand. That means if Barbara has at least two black honors, the hand makes. Essentially, I am saying the hand is on two of thee finesses. It turns out (although it is certainly not obvious) that the odds of that happening are 50 percent.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, the 4 possibilities are:
1) all the finesses win 
2) two finesses win 
3) one finesse wins 
4) no finesses win. 
Therefore, in two of four possibilities, you make the hand. Hence the odds of two of three finesses (at least) working is 50%.  know that sounds strange, but it is true.|

mykky:  How would 3nt work out ?|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a diamond lead, 3N is not very good  but it turns out a spade lead is more likely. I don't think, however, it is easy to come to 9 tricks. I think 4H is the best contract.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other point regarding the opening lead. Elizabeth has a raft of poor choices. A singleton trump is not a good lead in general, unless a trump lead is clear cut. Certainly on this auction a trump lead is not clear cut. Singleton trumps often give away tricks. if Barbara had another honor besides the A, it would have given away a trick. So, a heart is out. In NT, a spade lead would be fine. But, leading away from honors in a suit contract is very aggressive particularly when there is a lot of strength concentrated on your right. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Certainly, if East has a spade card, a spade lead could work out great. So, there was some merit to the spade lead but I would give it a lower priority. A club lead is even lower priority than a spade lead because the clubs are not as good, and has the same problem of leading away from an honor and doubletons are not strong leads either. I would have chosen a diamond, as the least likely to give something away, but a spade has some merit as I said before.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Play a small diamond to the nine of diamonds. Making five is guaranteed this way. This is called stripping the hand of safe exits. As long as you throw South in, she either has to give you a ruff and sluff, or your King of diamonds is good. The strip and end play comes up a lot. It is a very good technique to study.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the strip and endplay a bit further. The basic idea is you get rid of all the side suits, ruffing if necessary, and throw the non-dangerous opponent into the lead. In this case, South  is the non-dangerous opponent. By stripping the hand of clubs and hearts, Barbara made it impossible for South  to lead those suits without giving a ruff and sluff. And then by throwing South  in with a diamond, if South  leads another diamond, Barbara's king is good no matter who has the Ace. On this hand, since North  had the Ace of diamonds it did not matter, but if South  had the Ace of diamonds, it would have made a big difference. For those interested, I have a lesson on end plays, in my declarer lesson play series.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us look at Barbara's declarer points and Elizabeth's dummy points, once Barbara bids 1S. Once East bids 1S, Elizabeth counts as follows: 14 HCP, one quality suit for 15 Starting Points, and one point for the doubleton for 16 Dummy Points total in spades. Not quite strong enough to bid 3S, which, in Marty Bergen's methods, shows 17-19. Remember, Bergen has lots of addons, so he jumps with more Bergen points. So, Elizabeth has a maximum 2S bid as it turns out. Now, let's look at Barbara's hand. She has 10 HCP + one length point = 11 Starting Points. Once Elizabeth raises spades, she can add 2 points for the singleton, and 1 point for the 4-card side suit, which gives her a total of 14. Therefore using Bergen methods, she has enough to bid 4S. However, as I said, those unfamiliar with Bergen, many would bid 3S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have an interesting choice here. I can play a club and make Eileen ruff, leaving her one trump in each hand. Or I can play a spade, and hope that sets up a heart trick in partners hand. I will play a club, as that seems more likely to make it difficult for Eileen.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, my club play worked. What I did was make Eileen lose control of the hand, by forcing her to trump. That defense works particularly well when you have 4 trumps. Many people are reluctant to let declarer ruff their winners. But that is at worst a passive defense, since declarer can do that herself if she wishes. And sometimes it is a good defense, as in this case, as it makes declarer prematurely run out of trump.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Club four was the opening lead, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets see how Elizabeth's hand stacks up with Bergen hand evaluation. She has 13 HCP, two length points + one quality suit, for 16 Starting Points. Once spades agreed upon, two for singleton, one for sixth trump for total of 19 Declarer Points. If Eileen has a max of 14 and no wasted club points, then they do have 33--just enough for slam. But that is unlikely, so I probably would have been satisfied with game with Elizabeth's hand and pass after 4S.|

This week I borrowed pearls from Marty Bergen/Howard Schutzman online lessons series. This part is from "How To Create Trump Tricks" session in March 2010 . If you need further information please check ^*Hwww.hondobridge.com/mbonlineclasses.php?f=me^*N web site for additional information.  |

^-{  When to Lead Trumps - Marty Bergen/Howard Schutzman  }
^-|
CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3There are many auctions which scream for trump leads. Here are some of the most common: |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT|

^*B1. ^DDummy denied support for the major suit that declarer opened.^*N
Responder must have fewer than 3 cards (0, 1, or 2) in opener's major. You can almost see dummy's short suit. Once you do, a trump lead is almost always best.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


AT|

^*B2. ^DThe opponents sacrifice.^*N 
When the opponents sacrifice, almost always lead trump–-even with a singleton. You say that you were taught not to lead a singleton trump. That's good advice-–in general. However, when the declaring side has limited strength, trump leads are the way to go.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


AT|

^*B3. ^DYour side has strength in all of the side suits.^*N 
Sometimes, the opponents bid game when you know they can't have more than half the deck, and your side has shown values in all of the side suits. How did they justify bidding game? There can be only one answer – distribution. Neither he nor dummy can have a strong suit that can be used to discard losers. Your mission is clear. Lead trumps early and often.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


AT|

^*B4. ^DWhen your side opens 1NT, and you are on lead against a 2-suited auction, such as DONT or Cappelletti. ^*N
The opponents are playing in a suit because at least one of them has shape. They want to ruff your high cards; you don't want them to.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


AT|

^*B5. ^DPartner passes your takeout double of an opening bid of 1C or 1D.^*N 
Partner's "once every year and a half" pass of your one-level takeout double can only be based on a massive holding in opener's suit. Once you help partner remove the opponents' trumps, your strength in the other suits will allow your side to be in control. Next is an example where your side has strength in all side suits.|

You're fortunate to have several attractive choices. You'd like to lead partner's major, but the @DQ is also tempting. Which way should you go?|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|

Both diamonds and hearts can wait. Your side has strength in all three side suits. If South has losers in a red suit, neither he nor dummy can have a strong suit that can be used to discard those losers. Lead a trump.|

South will win the trump lead in dummy, and lead a club to his king. |

Declarer's goose is now cooked. Because dummy has only one remaining trump. South can't ruff both of his club losers on the board. In addition to his two inevitable heart losers and the @CA, he will eventually lose a second club trick and be down one.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On any other lead, declarer would have no problems. He would win the lead in his hand, and lead the @CK. At that point, South can't be prevented from ruffing both of his small clubs on the board.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
