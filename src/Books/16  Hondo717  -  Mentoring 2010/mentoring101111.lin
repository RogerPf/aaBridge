^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done by everyone. Let's first talk about why I bid 3D as opposed to a DONT double. I did that for the same reason you always preempt. It gets in the opponents' way. I am not sure they get to 6 otherwise, but 3D made it very difficult and 4D by my partner was an excellent law of total tricks bid. We take 8 tricks, down 2 doubled, so only -300.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should double by West mean? It certainly should not be penalty. It is not exactly Stayman either. It just shows some points. I don't necessarily recommend you play this, but Marty Bergen says any doubles of preempts of 3D, 3H, or 3S are "Thrump" doubles. They specifically deliver the following message. "Partner, I have points, but nothing clear cut to bid and I do not have a diamond stopper. I would like you to bid 3N with a diamond stopper." |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, had E/W been playing Thrump doubles, and had my partner not bid 4D East would bid 3N over the Thrump double and that makes as well. Why might 3N be better than the 4-4 heart fit? Bergen's reasoning is as follows:
4-4 fits are dangerous with a bad trump break and you often get a bad trump break after a preempt. So, 3N is often the right place to play.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's see what a possible auction is if I don't bid 3D. I like the following auction 1N-2C-2H-4D. 4D bid by West would be a splinter in diamonds, confirming hearts and then they might get to six  because the splinter implies slam interest. If West had no slam interest, (for example, say a 10 point hand with a singleton diamond), West would simply bid 4H. So, when you splinter, you are saying you are interested in slam. You should not splinter if you are not interested in slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about Shatha's excellent line of play. First, let's count the tricks--1 spade 2 hearts and a diamond. So, 3 more tricks are needed. On a really good day, you can take 4 diamonds and certainly taking 2 diamonds is possible so long as west has the club Ace. Therefore, starting with diamonds is fine. Once East shows the 10 of diamonds on the Ace, south made the correct play of finessing the 7 at trick 2. Why is that? |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well some of you are familiar with what is known as the "law of restricted choice." Typically, that law applies when you are missing the Q and J. Say you have a suit A10xxx in dummy and Kxxx in your hand. If you play the K and the J or Q drops on your right you should assume it is singleton and lead low to the 10 at trick 2. That play works around 75% of the time. It is not intuitive, but it is true. The doubleton QJ is very rare.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The same principle applies here. Once East drops the 10, you should play west for the J which is exactly what Shatha did. Well done!|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I know Shatha started with a doubleton, and East has the @HQ. Normally, a good play would be for me to lead a third heart, to prevent East from pitching a loser on the @HQ because partner will trump it. That position often comes up. You lead a suit both pard and dummy is out of, just to prevent a discard. But, in this case dummy has no useful discards. Actually it looks almost hopeless to defeat the contract. So, my next lead is just a guess.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally I would duck, but it looks to me like there are diamond discards on clubs. As I say, the only time to play second hand high is when you have a very good reason. That time I had a very good reason.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, now lets talk about the auction specifically the 2H bid. The 2H bid shows a limit raise or better in spades. The only question is, how many spades does it promise. Many people play 3. However, I like to play it shows 4 spades. Because knowing you have a 9 card fit is very important. Now, there is a convention to differentiate between a 3 card raise and 4 card raise that some experts use. They play the cue bid shows 3 card support, a 2N bid shows 4 card support.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes Eddy, that 2N convention is known as a "mixed raise."|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other question is, is 2C (instead of 2H) forcing. I play it is forcing. But, some people play new suits over an overcall are not forcing. I really do not agree with that approach. I think you have to play that new suits by responder are forcing, whether after an opener or an overcall.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note, that unlike major suit transfers, there are 2 bids available--here 2N and 3C. Most experts assign different meanings to each bid. If I bid 3C right away, it means I don't particularly like clubs which means I don't have 3 clubs to the Ace, or King, or Queen. If I bid 2N, I like clubs. The idea here is that if I like clubs, North may decide to bid a thin 3N game hoping we can take lots of club tricks. On this hand I like clubs. So, my bid is 2NT.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, it turns out that we go down on a heart lead if Shatha ducks the first heart. However, a heart lead is very hard to find on this hand. Once again aggressive bidding netted us a good result.|

shatha: Could I have bid 3h over 2@S being vul?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3H could work, but it is a bit risky. However, with such a nice suit, it is down 3 at worst. And if partner has a trick or two, perhaps only down 1 or 2. It turns out 3H works for 2 reasons:
^Ca) it is only down 1
^Cb) it gets pard to lead a heart, so we can't make 3N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before you bid Tom, there is something you should probably know. This is a rare auction. Normally a new suit by responder is forcing. However, over 1NT, with a strong hand Kerrie would have doubled. Therefore, 2S shows a weak hand with a longish spade suit. This is the same idea as over a takeout double. Over a takeout double, the only strong bid is redouble or Jordan 2N (if you play that). This is the same idea. You double with 9+ points. Anything but a double is weak. |

pc|S4|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, there is no clear cut lead, but let me give you some guidelines. Normally, you should not lead a suit bid by opponents, which makes diamonds an undesirable lead. And you should not lead away from an Ace, nor lead an unprotected Ace, which kind of makes clubs a bad lead. Finally, often leading a singleton trump gives away a trick. Partner is prone to have Qxx or Jxxx. So, by the process of elimination I would have led a heart but a spade could be right, and is my second choice. So undo is coming.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss Tom's opening bid. There are 2 schools of thought. One is with 3-3 you open 1C. The other is you open your better minor. Using that criteria, Tom had a 1D bid as he had Qxx in diamonds and xxx in clubs. That approach is called "better minor" and is used by many. There is one local expert here who even carries it to a further extreme. If he is 3-2 in the minors but his 2 card minor has better honors, he will open his 2-card minor. For example with Ax in diamonds and Jxx in clubs I have seen him open 1D. I think that is carrying it to an extreme, but it just goes to show that some people really like better minor. Generally speaking best minor is more HCP.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well the good news is Kerrie just pulled off a squeeze :). Of course the bad news is that held it to down 2. Now, let's discuss Kerrie's bidding. Many people bypass diamonds if they have a 4-card major. The main reason for that is, with crazy people like me preempting all the time, it is often better to get your major suits in as early as possible. However, 1D was an ok bid, as long as you don't play that you bypass diamonds in favor of a major.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you have to decide whether or not to bypass diamonds. More people do these days. BTW, for you bridge nerds, that treatment of bypassing diamonds is known as "Walsh." Now, let me tell you the approach I use. If I have a hand good enough for a second bid over 1N, I will bid diamonds rather than bypassing them. Here, since Kerrie has only 8 points, I would bid 1H with her hand. Further, the rule is with two 4-card majors, you bid hearts first. That gives partner, who often has spades, a chance to bid spades. |

{4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors}

The transfer to minors can be used for two purposes:|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT|

a) to allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |

AT|^B@2^Y@3
Most partnerships play Jacoby Transfers for major suits. However, interested players may use Jacoby Transfers for the minors as well. First, let me explain the benefits of transfers in minors.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT|

In general, if you have a weak hand with a long suit opposite a strong hand, it is more desirable to play in the weak hand's suit because in that suit, the long cards will take tricks, whereas in another suit it may not be possible to score the low cards in the weak hand's long suit. The only tradeoff is you have to play at the three level, which is kind of high. However, given a weak hand with seven clubs or diamonds, the tradeoff is worth it.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


AT|

Some partnerships play 2S as a transfer to minors. Opener automatically responds 3C. The partner bidding the transfer passes with clubs or corrects to 3D. That is easier to play, but not quite as flexible. I recommend you start with this simpler transfer and then progress to the stronger and more flexible version which I will explain next. Let me first show you a few examples of the simple transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT|

BTW, all "transfer bids" (2S and 2NT) should be alerted. Further both "accepted" and "rejected" response bids by the NT opener should be alerted as these are additional information available to the partnership that opponents should be aware of. To economize his time, the Movie Maker has not included the alerts in the following examples. Please consider it in every situation. |

{4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors}

^-|AT|^B@2^Y@3
One variant of Jacoby that I use is 4-suit Jacoby. A 2S bid by responder is a transfer to clubs, and a 2NT bid is a transfer to diamonds (to make a 2NT invitational bid, we bid Stayman followed by 2NT (e.g., 1NT-2C-2S-2NT does not necessarily promise hearts). Since there are two bids between the transfer bid and the transfer suit, opener now has two choices. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT|

With good support (3 to an honor), opener "accepts" the transfer by not bidding the suit (1NT-2S-2NT or 1NT-2NT-3C). 
With less than good support, opener "rejects" the transfer by bidding the transfer suit (1NT-2S-3C or 1NT-2NT-3D). |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

This is somewhat counter-intuitive, as one would think the more natural way would be for opener to bid the suit to "accept" the transfer. However, the reason for doing it this way is that it is more likely that opener will end up as declarer.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

Again, this convention can be used for two purposes:
1. To allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit if opener accepts the transfer. Otherwise, the contract will be 3 of the minor.

2. To play in 3 of a minor with 5 or fewer points and a 6-card minor.|

{4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors}

^-|cs||at|^B@2^Y@3

This version of Transfer to Minors is very powerful but can be confusing because the traditional invitational 2NT bid by responder no longer is available. To make an invitational raise to 2N (since a direct 2N is a diamond transfer), you bid Stayman first and then 2N. Therefore, if responder bids Stayman, on rare occasions she will not have  a 4-card major. You should have a thorough discussion with your partner if you would like to use this version of transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT| 

One major benefit of this version is that the partnership  can use it to bid thin 3N games. For example, suppose your partner opens 1N and you have AQxxxx of diamonds. You might transfer to diamonds, and if partner bids 3C which shows 3 to the K, you bid 3N since you likely have 6 diamond tricks. Let me show you an example.|

{Should You Transfer to Minors?}

^-|HT|f|cp||FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|That has been my question and finally I received the following answer from Howard.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|

As a general rule, it is usually much harder to take nine tricks than seven tricks. And three of a minor requires that you take nine tricks whereas 1N requires you only have to take seven tricks. Therefore, unless you are pretty sure you are going to take three more tricks in a minor-suit contract than in NT, you should not transfer. (If you take two more tricks in a minor-suit contract, you break even.) So, how do you know if a minor-suit contract will yield three more tricks? |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

Well, you don't. But here are some guidelines that work pretty well. If you have a 7-card minor and a weak hand, transfer. If you have a 6-card minor and shortness somewhere (a singleton or void) and a weak hand, transfer. Otherwise, don't bother.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT| 

By the way, this is essentially the same logic as to why you strongly prefer to play 3N as opposed to 5 of a minor. It is much easier to take nine tricks than eleven.|
