^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about my preempt. I have close to an opening hand but, in third seat, I felt it was a good tactic. My partner is a passed hand, so it is unlikely we have game and I am short in the majors, so it is likely they can outbid us in a major. It turns out they do have a heart fit. They will lose two hearts and a spade probably, perhaps one more. So, they are likely making at least three hearts. If I pass, and Eddy opens 1N, they probably get to 3H. So, I basically broke even and might beat a few pairs who venture to 4.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, at trick one I pitched my King of hearts not so much as a false card, as a way to get an entry to dummy. I was hoping East had the Ace of diamonds and therefore might only lose two diamond tricks. If I dont do that, I have no entry to dummy. Now as to the defense. The lead was fine. All other leads are likely to lose a trick. And because I pitched the @HK, Kerrie's spade shift was fine as well. I don't blame Eddy for leading a club, although he should probably play the Ace first and see how Kerrie signals. It did, however, out the club play cost him a trick. On the other hand, however, neither hearts nor spades looks right. I agree with playing a club, but I think the Ace is slightly better although playing any club is costly as it turns out.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I wanted to discuss the bidding, but hope made two declarer miscue which require to discuss. First, the spade play. The correct play is to let the 10 ride. All things being equal, it is a pure guess as to whether or not West had the King and not the Jack. But, the one case where it is right for sure is if West has both the King and Jack, as on this hand. So, because of that 25% chance, it is right to let the spade ride. You will come out ahead 25% of the time, the rest of the time it is a guess anyway.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other play was the diamond at trick seven. You were in danger of running out of trumps at that point, as you did. So, you should set up your clubs ASAP. Play 2 rounds of clubs and the suit will be set up, and you still have two trump left. In that fashion you will make the hand. There was no reason to play a diamond. In general, there is no reason for declarer to voluntarily shorten herself. You should shorten dummy to set up ruffs which are extra tricks. But declarer does not get extra tricks by ruffing. A long trump is a long trump, whether you ruff or just play it out. There are many reasons to set up declarer's side suits before running out of trump.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the bidding. I like to play 1N is still forcing by a passed hand  but some do not. The problem with playing it not forcing is a hand such as mine, a limit raise with three card support. If you decide not to play 1N forcing by a passed hand, then you should play Drury. Otherwise a hand such as mine is not biddable. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The final point is whether or not Eddy should open. I think it is fine to pass. A 4-3-3-3 hand with 12 counts are not particularly good hands. On the other hand, Eddy does have good HCP and some extra 10s. By Bergen adjust 3, he could add an extra Starting Point. In adjust-3 you add one point for when Aces/tens exceed the Queens/Jacks. So, I think I might open, but as I said pass is quite reasonable.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |

hope: I opened in FOURTH seat 1S  - could you not bid 2S - as I was below opening.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|How do I know you are below an opening bid? In fact, you probably should not be. I just open all seats using rule of 20. If they outbid me in spades, they outbid me in spades. That way at least pard knows what I have.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now that is an interesting call. Not sure what double should mean there. Essentially all suits have been bid (Kerrie showed spades with negative double). So, I would guess normally that would show clubs, although a case could be made that it shows the red suits with some tolerance for spades. With my wife Ava, it is definitely a penalty double but that is not the norm for most pairs. In any case, it must show some extras, so with my clubs pass is probably right. But hard to say.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That worked well for us. When you have a trump stack and shortness in pard's suit (singleton or void is best), you often set the hand. That is one secret of doubling--be short in pard's suit and long in their trump suit. Hope bid the hand correctly and played it reasonably well, was just very unlucky.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets discuss the bidding.  I would open 3S with Hope's hand. But with 7-2-2-2, 2S is conservative but acceptable. However, if she had a singleton, 3S is clear. I think in first seat, Marty would say 3S is ok. Eddy was tempted to bid I know, but he correctly passed. If his suit was hearts he has a case. But with clubs, the downside of getting too high is not worth the risk. Over 2S, Kerrie should bid 3S, using LOTT. Granted, she has a flat hand, but 9 trumps are 9 trumps and the law says 3S is fine.  We can make 4H, so you can be down 2 doubled in 3S. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My bid is pretty clear. Don't need much from Eddy to make 4H. I thought about 3N since that is one less trick. If my spade King had been the spade Ace, 3N has more merit as I have 8 sure tricks, and hopefully Eddy can provide 1 trick. I know, everyone is worried about clubs, but they shouldn't be. As Bergen says "Don't worry about sneak attacks in unbid suits." However, here I think 4H is best. Had Hope had opened 3S, Kerrie would bid 4S and give me a very big problem.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid 5C, so you are smarter than I :). That is the problem with preempts. anything could be right. Which is why I think hope should bid 3S and Kerrie should bid 4S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Several kibs asked me about Inverted Minors in competition. I recommend against inverted minors in competition. In competition Jordan 2N or redouble is available to show the strong diamond raise. Therefore, both 2D and 3D are weak raises. 3D just shows better diamonds. Pam, with her singleton heart and 5 great diamonds has a clear 3D bid over 1D. It is likely the opponents have a major suit fit, probably in hearts. Indeed, the opps can make 3H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, 3D shut you out Anna. You don't have a good hand. As to the play, the strongest lead by Terry is the Ace of spades. Leading away from a Queen is often dangerous and should be avoided if there is a better lead. Honor sequences tend to be better leads. On this hand my first choice is a spade, second choice a diamond, third choice a club. Terry should not cash the Ace of hearts because it may give up a trick. He should hope pard can get in to lead a heart through. In the end down 1 is a normal result. |

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Lead was club seven, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain your options Pam. If you bid 3S you are asking Terry to bid 3N with a spade stopper. However, you have a spade stopper. In general you should bid 3N, and hope you can take 9 tricks due to the club fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played Pam. You were down due to Terry's over enthusiasm. ^*BIn general, you should have at least an opening hand to overcall over a preempt^*N. There are a few exceptions, but Terry's hand is not one of them. He has nice clubs but only five and he has spades, which means he does not fit well with pard. So, he should pass. If he had something like x KQJxxx Axxx xx, he could consider 3H because there are many hands where 4H makes. But with a long minor that is not solid, there is not much upside to making a light overcall.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The basic rule is don't overcall without at least an opening hand and ^*Bdowngrade your hand if it has lenght and/or honors in the preempt suit^*N.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |

yhb: Why downgrade your hand if you have length in pre-empt suit?|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because you do not fit well with partner. I should put that another way. Downgrade your hand with length and honors. 4 small is probably ok, since partner is short, and behind the opponent who is short as well. However, Axxx is not that bad a holding. But Kxxx is not a great holding, even though the King is well placed because the King does not mesh well with pard. Finally, KJxx or Qjxx are real bad holdings because the Queen and Jack are wasted, and that means they don't have them, which means they have other high cards instead.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
