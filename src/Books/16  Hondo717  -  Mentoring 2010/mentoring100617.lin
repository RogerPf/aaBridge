^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1D was fine. Now I have a bit of an issue. The hardest slams to bid are when both people have intermediate openers--16 points or so each. So, I decided to temporize and bid an inverted 2D. 2D is a one round force, and shows 10+ points. The upper range is unlimited. Partner may not pass 2D. Eddy is now supposed to bid suits with stoppers.  The question is, what should Eddy bid. If he is an optimist (and I like bidding optimists :)) he can decide QJ of hearts is a stopper and bid 2NT. Classically, most people would bid 2S, showing a spade stopper and denying a heart stopper. Given his flat hand and honors in hearts, I think 2N  has some merit. Once he bids 2N, I am sure we do not have slam. Why is that?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because, Eddy cannot have more than 14 points. He would have opened 1NT with 15-17 balanced.  If he had 18+, he would make some other forcing bid, as 2N can be passed by me. Hence even though I have 16, I know we have at most 30, so slam is not likely. It is barely possible we have a diamond slam, but I also have flat distribution, so that seems unlikely as well. The moral of this hand is, even if you have a good hand, once you realize slam is not likely, don't "fall in love" (at least with your hand). Just take your plus.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is very makable. You only have at most a diamond loser. As long as you manage your entries correctly  you have to set up spades, and make sure you don't lose control prematurely. Your best line is to duck a diamond at trick two. Then you can draw trumps, play the KQ of spades, ruff to get back to your hand, play the Ace of spades. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the Jack does not drop, you ruff a spade, and still have a trump to get back to your hand to cash your last spade. The trick is to not use up the trump in your hand too early, as those are your entries. Nevertheless, that was a  hard hand to play. Many people would have gone down. I am just pointing out how it could be made to educate everyone on expert technique. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the bidding. Assuming 4D is natural, my hand cannot be any better. I have controls in every suit, four very good diamonds, and the King-Queen of Anna's other suit. I was more worried about missing seven then not making six.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about Eddy's sequence. He did a double and correct. He is showing a good hand 16+ with a good heart suit. With 8 good points, hope should not pass, as game is likely. With a doubleton heart or more, 4H would be clear. With her hand, it is possible that 3H is the best contract. But she really cant afford to miss game. However, if she wants to pass that is her choice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like to discuss the bidding before the play. West did a "double and correct" to 1N. That is how you show a hand too strong to overcall 1N--18+ balanced. But that is not what she has. The problem is she does not have a double to start with because of her spade holding and has a balanced 12. So, the auction was incorrect according to standard methods. However, since Lisa did not realize what West was trying to show, everything worked out ok. So, we will leave the contract as is.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lesson of the hand is, don't bid unless you have something to say :). Everyone knows I love to bid. However, in this case West has a clear pass. Sometimes you have to pass if RHO opens, even with an opening hand. If West feels like bidding, then 1H is the best bid. Some experts feel it is ok to overcall with 4 card suit with three honors. I don't care for that myself, as it screws up the law of total tricks. I would pass with West's hand.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, assuming there is a double, North has the same issue. North should only bid if he has something useful to say. That means either a good suit, or fairly good hand. Since he has neither, pass is probably best. Lisa, on the other hand, had her bid :). After all said and done, it worked out ok in the end, as they ended up in a reasonable spot. As a final reminder, any time you double and correct you are showing a strong hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the bidding and the spots I see, I know North has 5 clubs. He led the 5, and I can see the 4 and 2. the 3 is the only lower missing. If 4th best, based on the auction, North must have 5. By watching spots, watching the lead, and listening to the auction you can often work out the hand or at least the suit. Clues abound if you are careful about analyzing them. I would assume on this auction West has 6+ spades  which leaves pard with 1 or 2. Sometimes you are fooled. But you should still make the effort. Further, West has only two clubs. So I can cash my clubs first.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the problem occurred based on the opening bid.  I think with any 15-17 balanced even with a 5 card major you should open 1N. Otherwise it is hard to describe your points. Having said that, let us assume the auction as is. Once partner passes 2N, unless West has something very much extra, such as a good six card suit, or singleton club, pass is probably best. The 2N bid by North (unusual), showing at least 5/5 in the 2 lowest unbid suits (often clubs and diamonds) was fine.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good Ann. Always best to lead back partner's suit. However, there is guidelines for which card to lead back in partner's suit. You lead back remaining count, so partner can figure out the distribution. If you have two left, you lead high, if you have three left you lead low. Had you led the diamond three back, since East did not play the Ace, I would have assumed East started with AJxx of diamonds.|

pc|D2|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now because the three is missing, I have some hope that East started with AJx and my fourth diamond will be good. This is another example of why correct defensive carding is important.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets talk about what Rosemary should do over 2N. Many people like to pass with only six points. Most of you wont be surprised when I say I am not one of those people :). I think you should strain to find a game. Playing exactly 2N is only right when you can take exactly eight tricks. On the other hand, the game bonus is such that you should strain to bid game. I rarely pass a 2N 18-19 rebid, except when I have a flat hand with five or six points. In this case, there are two possible games. East might have four spades, so 4S is a possible contract. 3N might make on a good day.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the bid I would choose with the West hand is 3D, new minor forcing. That way, it gives their side a chance to get to 4S in addition to a thin 3N. If Rosemary had 4 diamonds instead of 4 spades, I might choose to pass 2N, but I wouldn't be happy. But, with four spades, I have an excuse to bid on :) and that always makes me happy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very unlucky hand. Particularly given the auction, where the King of spades rates to take a trick, 4H is a good contract. Let us count North's Bergen Dummy Points. The hand has 14 Bergen Dummy Points: 8 HCP, two length points, one for each five card suit, one for doubleton, and three for singleton and 4+ trump. The hand is actually good enough for a 4C splinter bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, given south's club holding, that is not what South wants to hear. But, had South had a different hand  6@H makes.|

JanaDe: Could East, non vulnerable, have bid 4S?|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a definite case to be made, given the vulnerability. Unfortunately you lose two diamonds and two clubs and go down 1 while N/S also go down in 4H. But, had the King of spades been in South's hand, 4H makes, so 4S is a very good sacrifice. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally would have bid 4S. By bidding 4S, it is also quite possible that the opponents would have pushed N/S to 5H given the distribution. So, 4S might have worked out very well even on this layout.|

With 18+ and an unbalanced hand opener rebids 2 spades if he has four spades and does not have four hearts. Moreover, in responding to NMF, opener does not need to show strength as he has already shown 18-19.  Therefore, his responses should show his holding in the majors. |

One more point. In those auctions, the 1@H bidder (the responder) does not necessarily have 5 hearts; he may just be 4-4 in the majors. Here let us add the following for those who are interested in point ranges for the responder. Over a 2N rebid (18-19), if you use NMF, you are in a game-forcing auction. As a general rule, a 2N bid establishes a game force. On occasion, responder will pass with up to a bad 6, but if responder makes any bid, it is a game force. With those points in mind, let us focus on the opener's rebid options with the above auctions. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have 5 spades, so you need to check to see if I have 3 spades. It works as follows. You bid 3 clubs (the other minor that I didn't bid). If I have 4 hearts.  I will bid hearts. Otherwise with three spades I will bid spades. So you can check for a 5-3 spade fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, before I pass, let me explain a bit further. If I have both 4 hearts and 3 spades, I will bid hearts, and North must bid 3NT. However, in that case, because Anne bid NMF and does not have hearts, I know she must have 5 spades, so I will correct to 4 spades. When partner bids NMF, you prefer your 4-card suit to 3-card support. But, if partner denies the 4-card suit, she must have 5 of the other suit, because otherwise she would not have bid NMF.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first question is, should West open 1N or not. Hands with 16 or 17 points are hard to show. However, with 2 doubletons in the majors, I don't like opening 1N, but one could certainly make an argument for it. So, 1D is the bid here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, the question is what to do over the 1S bid. 2C is a slight underbid.  Again, this is the problem with 16 and 17 point hands. Granted, the fifth diamond makes the hand worth 18 Starting Points. Further, the hand has more Aces/tens than quacks. So, we give 19 Starting Points to West. Therefore, 2N is a good bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as East has 13 HCPs and a 5-card suit giving her 14 Starting Points and West is showing 18-19 points, that is just enough for slam. However, most of the time, slam will be iffy, so I would probably content myself with 3N. Further, 6N is the hardest slam to make. It is almost always easier to play in a suit slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There seems to be a great deal of confusion among all my students about forcing bids by responder vs. forcing bids by opener. For responder, the rule is simple. A new suit by responder is forcing for one round. For opener, a new suit is not forcing. The only way to make a forcing rebid is either to reverse or jump shift. Also, keep the following in mind that when:|

Sure, you would probably like to ask what about the rebid by opener, our rebid, and the fine points. |

I hear you. But, let me be Sam and play it one more time before I get to the fine prints. For that, I like to memorize how Howard plays Inverted Minor Raises. It also deals with many of the fine points which we should learn. Let's hear it.|
PG| ***** 270 ***** |

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
qx||HT|E|CS|1|CP|4|FP|2|at|^-{   How I play Inverted Minor Raises - by Howard     }
^-|CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@31) If I make a minor raise (to either the 2 level or 3 level), I am guaranteed to have no 4-card major. |
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


AT|

2) I make a jump raise (to the 3 level) with 5 to a bad 9 points and a 5+ card suit. I might have the other minor, but feel that the jump raise is tactically the right thing to do to make it difficult for the opponents. I will tend to prefer the jump raise to a bid of 1N if I have 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 272 ***** |


AT| 

3) I make a limit raise with 10+ points and usually 5-card support. (The only time I will have 4-card support is if I am 4-4 in the minors and partner opens 1D.) If partner opens clubs, I will not have 4 diamonds. If partner opens diamonds, I will not have 5+ clubs (in SAYC; in 2 over 1,  1D/2C is slightly more complicated).|
PG| ***** 273 ***** |


AT| 

4) Opener should now respond with his lowest stopper. If responder has less than a game-forcing hand, he should continue to bid stoppers below three of the agreed upon suit, or 2N if he has ^*Iall the other suits stopped^*N. |
PG| ***** 274 ***** |


AT|

5) If responder has a game-forcing hand, he must make sure the partnership bids game by either bidding 3N, if all suits are stopped, or continue bidding new suits, if not. |
PG| ***** 275 ***** |


AT|

6) Similarly, if opener has 15+ points, it is his responsibility to make sure the partnership reaches game by either bidding 3N, if all suits are stopped, or continuing to bid new suits, if not. |
PG| ***** 276 ***** |


AT|

7)|FP|2|AT| Once 3 suits have been bid (the original suit and 2 stopper suits), if someone bids the fourth suit, that is asking about a stopper rather than telling, because if the bidder has the remaining suit stopped, he can bid NT himself. |FP||
PG| ***** 277 ***** |


AT|

8) Inverted minors are off in competition (including over takeout doubles), in the sense that a raise to 2 is less than a limit raise. A raise to 3 is still preemptive.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
