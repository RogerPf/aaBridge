{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming hearts break normally 4 hearts plus a ruff in one of the two hands, 2 clubs, 3 spades and 1 diamond. So, we make as 5H + 2 clubs + 3 spades + 1 diamond = 11. However, we also have to possibly lose 2 diamonds and a spade. Therefore, we might only have 10. The other problem is this lead is suspicious. If it is a singleton and Eddy has the Ace of diamonds and King of spades I could go down. But Eddy did not overcall 1S so I will take a chance. First, we better take care of trump right away.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we need to discuss the play in a minute but first lets talk about the bidding. The reason I bid 2C was that it gave me the most flexibility to control the auction. If Hope bids 2H or 2S, I decided my hand was good enough to bid 4H or 4S. If she bids 2D or 2N or 3C, I was planning on bidding 3S to show a limit raise with 3 card support. The 2C bid gives me more flexibility to control the auction than a simple 1N forcing followed by 3S.|

dustinst22:  With the singleton @d, is our hand Game Force?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. No, the 2D bid was a negative, which is why I bid 3S, not 4S. Counting Bergen Dummy Points, I have 9 HCP + 2 for singleton + 1 length + 1 quality suit for 13 dummy Points. So, theoretically I have enough for game. But 2D was not what I wanted to hear, so I was a bit conservative.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dustinst22: Yes, Drury is helpful here.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't agree that Drury is any more helpful there than my auction. In fact, I think my auction has us better suited to find out whether or not we have game. Drury certainly can have some advantages, but one disadvantage of an artificial bid is that it does not describe your hand. In my way, we can both naturally describe our hands and have a better idea on a close game whether or not to bid it. However, on other hands, Drury could work out well.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, to the play. This hand is an excellent illustration of needing a plan. The hand can be made. Let's count winners. There are 5 spades, assuming a good break, 2 hearts and a club. That's only 8 tricks. However, we can also score 2 diamond ruffs for 2 more tricks. So, at trick 2, lead a diamond. Even if they win and play a trump, there are still 2 trumps left in dummy to trump 2 diamonds. In general, you should only draw trump immediately about 40% of the time. Probably the most common reason not to draw trump, as on this hand, is so that you can use dummy's trump to ruff losers. As a sound practice, you should look for it right away, particularly when dummy only has 3 cards in trump.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very interesting hand. They can make 4H or 4S but we should be doubled in 5D by Hope. It is very likely she has 3 tricks. And even if she doesn't, Kerrie could easily have one. So, particularly since we are vulnerable, Hope should double. With only 4 spades it is likely 2 spades are cashing. Otherwise, we might be stealing the hand from them, as on this hand.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me discuss Eddy's opener. Many people like to open 1D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. The idea being it makes for an easier rebid over 1 of a major. I am not one of those people. In that area Lawrence and Bergen agree, and I disagree. Let me tell you why I prefer to open 1C. As you know I am a big LOTT fan. If you open 1D with 5/4 or 4/5 in diamonds and clubs, I will never know which. So, I think you should open 1C with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds, and agree that a 2C rebid can be done with 5 clubs. But that is just me. Most experts think that it is ok to open 1D on many hands with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. But as Eddy says, most would open 1C with his particular hand since the clubs are very good, and the diamonds are not.|

PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a few points here. I would open Roberta's hand 1S. Although her Queen of hearts is suspect, her quality spade suit is a plus, so it does meet the rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, assuming you play 1N by a passed hand is still forcing, Qian was attempting to show a limit raise with 3 trumps. Although he technically does have 10 points, because of his flat distribution, I would probably just bid 2H with his hand. On the other hand, certainly a limit raise is not unreasonable, particularly since he has 2 quick tricks. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, instead of doubling, Roberta should bid 2S. In general, you should always prefer to overcall a 5 card major to doubling. In fact even if it goes 1 of a minor, and you are 5/4 or 4/5 in the majors you should prefer to bid your 5 card suit to doubling. It makes it easier for partner to compete. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One final comment on the defense. It is an interesting question as to which spade Sandy should lead with 3 small. I am talking hypothetically here. If Sandy had three small spades, I suggest she lead low for the following reason. Partner has implicitly bid spades with her double and my rule when leading partner's suit when you have not supported is to lead count.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if partner bids a suit, you have not supported, and you have three small, you should lead low even if in general you lead high from 3 small. Because it turns out usually count provides more information when leading partner's suit. It is a different story when partner bids a suit and you support. Once you have supported, pard knows you have at least three. So, you lead high with no honor, low with an honor when you have three, always high with doubleton.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Roberta. We discussed the bidding but let's talk about 4-4 vs 9 card fits. The conventional wisdom is that 4-4 fits play better. The reason for that is because the long suit can be used to throw off losers, which is what happened on this hand. However, a nine-card fit or even a 5-3 eight-card fit has one important advantage. If trumps break 4-1 in a 4-4 fit, declarer is usually in trouble. Whereas they rarely break 4-0 in a 9 card fit. And even with a 5-3 fit, if they break 4-0 at least declarer has one more trump than defender. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, the 4-4 fits are not always desirable. For close games they are, because you might need that extra trick in the long 5 or 6 card suit. But, in games which are clear cut, the 5-3, or 9 card fit is usually safer.|

sshmj: In this hand, if we had @hA, we can play 7@D, but can only play 6@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here you are only in 5 Qian. If diamonds were 4-1, would you rather be in clubs or diamonds? That is the tradeoff.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Excellent double and defense. Because of the bad heart split and unfavorable spades, 4 spades is down. Just as you should tend to bid when short in the opponents suit, you should think about doubling when long in their suit particularly when they get past the 3 level. You should also be short in pard's suit which Hope was. So, the double worked out well. Also please note that Kerrie's double was still takeout. The general rule is that, if the contract is at the 3 level or less, and pard has not yet bid, and there are 2 unbid suits, double is still takeout. I would bid 3S with Hope's hand, but 3H has some merit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us first discuss why Jana should consider slam, even though on this hand she should only make 5. Let us count her Bergen Points. She has 17 HCP, plus 1 length point, = 18 starting points. Once Darlene raises hearts, she can add 2 for the singleton and 1 for the 4 card diamond suit, which gives her 21. With  Darlene's 12, they are in slam range. And indeed if Darlene had the Q of spades in addition to what she had, it does make slam. I am not saying Jana should bid slam, but she should consider it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. She did well to leave one trump out and play the diamonds. Basically, if diamonds do not break 3-3, she needs to trump a diamond on dummy. By playing diamonds instead of drawing the last trump, she gives herself extra chances to make 5. If I have 3 or more diamonds, she gets rid of her diamond loser. And if I only have 2 diamonds, she merely exchanges a trump trick for a diamond loser, so comes out even. So the diamond play was very good. However, once she sees that they break 3-3, she can then draw the last trump, before cashing the diamond and mking five.|
