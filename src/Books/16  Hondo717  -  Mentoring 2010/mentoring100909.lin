{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a good illustration of when it is right to lead trumps. If the opponents are bidding a lot, and you have lots of points, they must have good distribution, singletons, and voids. So, you are trying not to let them score their trumps separately. Therefore, you do so by leading trumps.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding in general was good. Note that my negative double specifically shows exactly 4 spades. Whenever it goes 1x-1H-dbl, that shows exactly 4 spades. On the other hand, 1x-1H-1S shows 5 or more spades.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also one thought on Kerrie's hand. I had a similar 4-3-3-3 12 count in my session Yesterday. Kerrie's hand does not meet the rule of 20. 12 HCP + 7 in 2 longest suits = 19. Even if you use Bergen adjusted HCP, Kerrie still has 12 HCP. So, it is not strictly an opener although I admit I hate to pass 12 point hands myself, so I don't blame Kerrie too much :).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well Kerrie's bid of 3N had some merit. If I have some diamond cards it could make. However, it would be a bit better if her diamonds were just a tad better, say KQ10xxx or even perhaps KQxxxx.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let's talk about opening honor leads vs NT. They are somewhat different than leads vs suits. The lead of an Ace has a specific meaning in NT. It is typically done from a solid suit missing one honor. Often from a suit like AKJ10(...) or occasionally AQJ10(...). It asks partner to unblock an honor if he has one, usually the Queen, occasionally the King. If partner does not have an honor, then he should give count. Eddy's play of the 5 on the Ace of spades was correct--showing a doubleton. Having said that, if Nada chooses to lead spades, she should lead a low spade. With AKxx in a suit, the more standard lead in NT is 4th best.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was lucky in the hearts. Normally they should be able to take six hearts and 2 spades off the top which is the danger side of bidding 3N with Kerrie's hand. On another issue, Eddy asked me if I would open 2H with his hand, and I said no. But it turns out they can make 4H, thus proving that even Howard sometimes doesn't open weak-2s when he should :). |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|
FM75:  Should Kerrie bid 2S instead?|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she plays 4 suit transfers, she could bid 2N, diamond transfer. I will respond 3C, showing that I have 3+ diamonds to an honor and then she would probably still bid 3N, so that bid doesn't really help. I think the basic issue is Kerrie's suit is a bit weak.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think Nada might have come up with a different plan. Once Eddy leads a club, she can count 3 heart and 3 club tricks. So, all she has to do is take 2 trump tricks to make her contract. She should make sure they do not ruff out her winners. She does not need to trump anything on the board. So, if she just leads a low spade at trick 2, she can knock out the A and Q, and everything will work out easily. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately, she got some help from the defense. But the way she played it she would usually make 2 or perhaps even go down. Again, it comes down to counting your winners and coming up with a plan to take your winners. On opening lead, you should always look at all 4 suits to develop your plan.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me remark on Eddy's opening lead. Leading away from an honor is a high risk lead. Typically I try to avoid leading away from honors, unless it is the only unbid suit or my partner has bid it. It could work out well. However, in general, given a suit I have an honor vs a suit with no honors, I tend to favor the suit with no honors.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being, if declarer is taking a finesse in that suit, it is working anyway, so I am less likely to be giving something away. Eddy was a bit unlucky to be sure and I can construct many hands with the same auction where a club lead is right, and a diamond wrong. Opening leads are one of the least precise arts in bridge. So, all you can do is follow the odds and have a consistent set of rules as to what you do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's count my Bergen points. I have 16 dummy points--13 HCP, 1 length point, and 3 for singleton due to 4 trumps. It is just at the upper limit to splinter (13-16 dummy points). With a stronger hand (17+) Bergen recommends Jacoby 2N rather than a splinter because splinters take up a lot of bidding room.|

mb|4D|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us analyze if Roberta should look for slam. Unfortunately the King of diamonds is wasted. Had it been in another suit, then Roberta should look for slam. The idea holdings in a suit in which I have splintered are 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the Ace. If partner splinters, and you have one of those holdings, even with a minimum opener, you should consider slam.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way you played it you were very lucky on this hand Roberta. There are better plans. Let me discuss them. First of all, one of my students pointed out I miscounted my Bergen points. Actually I have 17--13 HCP, 1 length point, 3 for singleton. Therefore, I am actually too strong to splinter and my bid should have been 2NT. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, let's count Roberta's winners with the bidding as it was. She can count 2 clubs, 2 spades, 4 hearts assuming normal breaks. She has two choices for making more tricks. Probably the easiest choice is to simply ruff 2 diamonds, or if West has the Ace, only 1 diamond need be ruffed. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Her other choice is to set up dummy's spades. She has to plan and decide at trick 1 which plan she should follow. If she decides to ruff 2 diamonds, she should win the club in dummy and play a diamond. If she decides to set up spades, she should win in her hand to preserve the King of clubs as an entry. Let's take the easier approach of ruffing 2 diamonds. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There were some issues with the play, but I want to focus on Roberta's balancing first. Basically, if they have an 8+ card fit, and have voluntarily stopped at the 2 level, you should always try to push them higher if at all possible. When it goes 1H-P-2H, they have a known 8 card fit at least. And then when I pass, you know that the points are approximately equal between each side.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason for "if they have a fit, you have a fit" is, if you are short in their suit, mathematically, you must be long in some other suit. The  bottom line is if it goes 1x-p-2x-p-p, you should almost always balance in the pass out seat. And Roberta has the perfect balancing double hand--3 diamonds with their 9 card fit is a very nice contract.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One comment on the defense. Ann, you should rarely trump when you have a natural trump trick. In particular when Don led a spade off dummy, there was no reason for you to trump. Same with club. You are just giving away a trick. At worst, if Don wins the trick you are just trading and if it turns out Roberta can win the trick (which she could in spades), you gave up a trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is actually a good bid by Don. Marty Bergen calls that "pre balancing." Don is the one short in our suit, so he makes the takeout double, suggesting Roberta bid her longest suit. He is not showing any extra values, just spade shortness.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general Ann played the hand well. She listened to the bidding and therefore played the spade suit correctly. Also, she was reasonably confident the diamond finesse was working. Once she gets the spades right, and the diamonds work she can count 10 tricks--4 spades, 3 diamonds, 2 hearts and one club.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the rule for bidding slams is as follows. You can bid six if you have all the key cards. If you are missing one key card, then you should have the Queen of spades. Since Dee knows she is missing one key card and the Queen of spades, 5 is the correct place to play. As she is likely to lose 2 tricks. Six happens to make on this  hand, but the odds are only 40%. You don't want to bid 40% slams. Undo is coming.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, excellent bidding on this hand. Let's count Bergen points. After 1S, lets look at Pam's Dummy Points. She has 13 HCP, minus one for Jx of hearts, plus two length points, plus one for quality suit in diamonds, and plus 3 for singleton with 4 card trump support for a total of 18 Dummy Points. Therefore, she has a clear 3S bid, which shows 17-19 Bergen Points. |
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let's count Dee's declarer points. She has 12 HCP, plus two length points for 14 Starting Points. Once Pam supports spades, she can add two points for the singleton, and an extra point for the 4+ card heart side suit which comes to 17 Declarer Points. Therefore, if they have enough key cards, they should be in six, as they have a minimum combined count of 34. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need 33 to explore for slam. However, once they discover they are missing one key card and the Queen of spades, they should settle for 5. As I said, six happens to make on this hand, but in the long run 5 will be a better contract than six. You should only bid a small slam if you have all the key cards, or 4 key cards plus the Queen of trumps.|

Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
