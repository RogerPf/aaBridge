^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets count your Bergen Points (Declarer Points). With 17 HCP + 1 length + 1 quality suit - 1 for singleton Queen of clubs give your hand 18 Starting Points. Once I raise you add 2 for singleton  and 1 for side diamond suit which gets you to 21. Therefore, you can bid 4H if you like. It is true, however, that both black queens are dubious and it is reasonable not to count them at full value. But, Josie's bid is conservative but reasonable.|

mb|3S|SB|S|mb|4H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I have very good high cards once Josie bids 3D, so I should raise to 4 even without Pam's 3S bid. Josie's 3D bid is asking me to raise with some diamond cards or a maximum hand. I have diamond card, and the Ace of clubs is very good as well. So, 4H seems like a good shot to me. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4H is a very reasonable contract. It depends on good breaks in both red suits. Unfortunately hearts did not break, but that does not mean the bid is wrong. Next, let's look at Elizabeth's 2S bid.  I personally don't like it with 3 Jacks.  After the 2S bid I would bid 4S with Pam's hand like a shot, expecting partner to have a better hand. It is ok to be aggressive, but with only 3 trumps, 3 J, and 4-3-3-3, Elizabeth has a horrible hand. A raise promises 6 points, and the hand is not even close.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only change I would make joseye is to ruff a spade in dummy before drawing all the trumps. Then if hearts break 3-2, and diamonds break 3-2, you would lose 2 spades and 1 diamond and make 4. Always, before drawing trumps, you just need to remember to figure out if you need some of dummy's trumps to ruff losers. It is a good habit to get into. Regardless, with this hand and proper defense you are always down 1 because of the bad heart break.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a special bid by Elizabeth. Typically it shows a long running club suit probably a 7 trick hand. So, that is not really the appropriate bid here Elizabeth. I will discuss the bidding afterwards.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, it is very possible to get to 6C on this board. But the bidding has to be different. Here is my suggested bidding. 1C is fine, as is 1H. Then, I think Elizabeth should bid 2D, which is a reverse. Josie can now bid 2S, which is 4sf, saying Josie is interested at least in game. Elizabeth can bid 2N and Josie can bid 3C. 3c is is a slam try in clubs. If Josie had a weaker hand she would have bid 3C over 2D.  |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general principle, once responder bids 4sf, their next bid establishes why they bid 4sf. so, by bidding 4sf (2S) followed by 3C, Josie is telling Elizabeth she has clubs and is interested in slam. After 3C. Elizabeth can bid 3D, a control bid. Josie would then bid 3S, because Josie is worried about 2 heart losers. Once Josie bids 3S, Elizabeth can bid RKCB and get to 6C. So, Let me to undo all the bidding and start from 1H.|

But it still should be bid. On that auction I would probably lead a spade. Leading a trump from Jx could potentially  could give up a trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's talk about the bidding. It actually turns out 3C was a reasonable bid by Josie. 3S is ok, but has 2 flaws. One is the spade suit, although long enough (6 cards) is not really strong enough. The second is, she is a bit strong for 3S. With 18 HCP and a six card suit, she can make a game forcing bid. So, 3C was one choice.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other choice is 3N. But 3N probably does not make on a diamond lead. So, 3S worked out best anyway. I think Pam should probably pass 3S. In this case, with less than 8 and only 2 spades, I think pass is probably right.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|
dee_dee_20: 3@c would be forcing to game as 3@s is invitational?|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question by dee.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction 1S-1N-3S shows an invitational hand by opener. It can be passed and usually is unless responder has at least 8 points. So, a jump raise by opener is invitational, not forcing. On the other hand, a jump shift by opener, such as 1S-1N-3C, shows a game force. Responder may not pass below game. Many players think 1S-1N-3S is forcing, but it is not.|

EddyHaskel: What is the "technically correct" balancing bid in pass out seat with 15+ balanced?|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An alternative for North is to double and then rebid NT. That is how you show the stronger NT, sort of a "double and correct."  I am not sure we make 3N on a spade lead. We have three hearts, one spade one diamond for sure, depends on how clubs work out. But we were only in 1N anyway. Down three is probably an ok result, and in IMPs no one should double.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, just remember that if possible, use your Aces to capture the other side's honor. So, the Ace of clubs should be ducked. If North takes the Ace of clubs, she sets up two tricks for the offense. by ducking they only get one.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss 3rd seat openers for a minute. I personally prefer using the rule of 20 in all seats. But many like to open light particularly with the majors. A few people would agree with peekaboo because they want a club lead. But the problem is we will often get too high. However, it is more a matter of style.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to 4th hand opener. It does not meet the rule of 20 (12 HCP + 7 length). However, it does meet the "rule of 15" which some play for 4th seat. The rule of 15 says you should open 4th seat if your HCP + spade length = 15 or more. And if you use that East has 16 using the rule of 15 and can open. I personally don't hate a pass. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have done very well over the years using rule of 20 in all seats. But again,  others swear by light 3rd seat openers and rule of 15. You each have to decide for yourselves.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East played the club suit correctly, just was unlucky. She needs to take 9 tricks in the minor suits before we cash our spades. And with 9 clubs and no information from the bidding, playing the AK of clubs is a slightly higher percentage than finessing the Queen. So, the play was fine. However, the bidding was not. East is not close to a 2 club opener.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically there are 3 rules you can use to determine if you  have a 2 club opener.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT|
First, is if you have a balanced hand with 22 or more|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


AT|
Second, is if you have a major then you can use Marty Bergen's 4 and 4 rule. If you have 4 quick tricks and no more than 4 losers, but real losers, not losing trick count losers, you can open 2C.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


AT|
The third rule is if you can count 9 tricks in your hand you can open 2C. Using that rule, you can count 2 diamonds 1 spades and 4.5 clubs  which is only 7-8 tricks, not enough to open 2C.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |

peekaboo9: Our bridge teacher told us if we have only 4 losers we can open 2@C.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It depends on how you count losers. You should not use losing trick count. I would peg your hand as two heart losers, at least two diamond losers and one club losers.
It is particularly undesirable to open 2C with a long minor. Because you are at the 3 level before you really begin the bidding Thus, I would not open 2C with a long minor unless I have a really good hand. |

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. South opened with spade seven, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next section. |

A brief review of Bergen's  hand evaluation is the topic for this week. It is based on Bergen's recent article in ACBL ^*IBridge Bulletin^*N February 2010 edition, ^*ISlam Bidding Made Easier^*N by Marty Bergen, and Howard's Slam Bidding Lesson Series--lessons 1 and 2. You can read a detailed explanation on his web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/##slamlessons^*N.|

^b@2^Y@3The first and the most critical step in Bergen's hand evaluation is counting the "Starting Points" which is the true value of each hand before the bidding. The second is "Dummy Points" which is the Starting Points of the dummy's hand after adding the dummy points after a fit. And finally the "Bergen Points" or the "Declarer Points" which is declarer's Starting Points again after a fit has been established. As this s only a brief, several portions of Bergen's hand evaluation such as "Adjust-3", the "Quality Suits",  the "Dubious Singleton/Doubletons", and etc are not discussed here. For a detailed review please check the sources mentioned above. So, let us look at what I have. Here, let me confess that in many places without shame I have copied the exact text from my sources.|

HT|I|AT|^m@2^Y@3Notice that all three hands have 14 high card points and identical honor cards. Let's focus on distribution.

You are the dealer. Obviously, you will open 1S on all three hands. The only question you need to answer is, before the auction begins, how many starting Points do you have? Let us evaluate each hand. |

Let us move to the next important point. Partner opens 1H. With either of those three hands, whether you plan to raise hearts right away or show your spades, because you have a heart fit, the relevant concept is Dummy Points.
All you have to do is add your ^*Bshort-suit points^*N to the Starting Points that you already determined in first exercise. Then you can decide what to bid. Let us take a look.|

^*BDeclarer Points^*N or ^*BBergen Points^*N is next. For the same three hands you open 1S and partner responds 2NT (Jacoby 2NT). Partner promises four or more spades and 13 or more Dummy Points. How many Bergen Points do you have? What would you bid? Let us practice.|

Sometimes, there is no fit. For example, partner opens 1C and you have one of the three hands. 1S is the correct response with each hand. Then partner rebids 3C showing an invitational hand with a strong suit of six or more. What now?  Let us look at the hands again.|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
