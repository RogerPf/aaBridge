^d @e@2"nome" believes, "You need repetitions when you start bridge late." So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in a presentation such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: Well done. Now I would like to talk a little about how to keep track of suits. First, let's start with trump suit.

^d@e@2hondo717: To keep track of trumps, I recommend a slightly different technique @E@3 other than counting with your fingers. Let us say for example, you have 8 trumps, then there must be five trumps out. They must be divided either 3-2 (most of the time), 4-1 (occasionally), or 5-0 (rarely).

Therefore, during the last board after one round is played, and both follow, there are 3 out. Now you know they were divided either 4-1 or 3-2. After the 2nd round, in the last hand, when I did not folllow, you know that they were divided 4-1, so Sarah has 2 left. 

You can also realize that hearts were a key suit to keep track of, since you and dummy had  7 Hearts. With a 6 cards out, they can be divided 3-3 (turns out about 1/3 of the time), 4-2 (about half the time), 5-1, or 6-0. So, in that hand you only need to keep track of Hearts and Spades. With a 7 card fit, they are almost always divided 4-2 or 3-3.  Then once Sarah and I both follow twice, you know they are either 3-3 or 4-2. And after the 3rd round, you can figure out they are divided 4-2. As you see, perhaps you can use the process of elimination to figure out how they are divided.|

^d@e@2hondo717: You don't need to know the exact percentages. There is one basic guideline @E@3 that is easy to remember. If there is an odd number of cards out, they tend to be divided as evenly as possible. For example, if you have an 8 card fit, the most likely division for the opps is 3-2. Just remember that if odd number out, breaks as evenly as possible, 4-3 if 7 out, 3-2 if 5 out, 2-1 if 3 out.

If an even number out, a non-even division is more likely. With a 9 card fit, a 3-1 break is more likely than a 2-2 break. In about 50%  they are 3-1, 40% that they are 2-2.

Just the principle that with an even number out, they do not break evenly. Similarly, with a 7 card fit, 4-2 is the most likely break. 3-3 happens, but not as frequently as 4-2. |

^d@e@2hondo717: Now how do you apply this prinicple?  Let me give one example. Say @E@3 you are playing a contract, and you can make it by either playing for a 3-3 break, or taking a finesse in a 4-2. 

The answer is you take the finesse. Now, having said that, if possible, try for both plays. When playing a contract, try to give yourself as many chances as possible. So, where you can try for several alternatives, hoping that one would work.

Typically, if you can try for the break, and know whether or not you get the break without losing a trick, you should try for the break first. Because if it works, you dont lose a trick. If you try the finesse first, you will lose a trick 50% of the time. However, as I said, in an "either-or" situation, try for the finesse rather than an exact even split.|

hondo717: in "coded 10s and 9s" lead, if you lead the J, that denies a higher honor. So you lead J specifically, from J109, with nothing higher. if you lead the 10, it shows a broken sequence, KJ10x, or AJ10x, or it just shows 109x. When you lead the J, pard knows you have nothing higher, if you lead the 10, you often have the broken sequence. In this case since I have KJ10, I am going to lead the 10. Leading a 9 is similar to 10. The 9 either shows a broken sequence (A109x, K109x, Q109x) or just 9xxx.

Some people explain coded 10s and 9s as "10 or 9 shows zero or two higher." That is a true statement, but it lacks lots of information.

hondo717: If you do not play coded 10s and 9s, the standard lead is J from KJ10 or AJ10.  From J109 you lead the J, not the 9, even though you have two higher than the 9. Similarly from QJ10 you lead the Q, not the 10. So you have to agree with your pard what you play.

hondo717: To summarize, the lead of the 10 or 9 shows either a broken sequence, or the top of a sequence.|

hondo717: First, let me discuss pam's (West) bidding, which was excellent.  She made what is known as a "double and correct."  She first doubled and then bid her suit.  This is much stronger than simply over calling 1@H.  By doubling and then bidding Hearts, she is showing a very strong Hearts suit, and at least 16 HCPs. And, if  sally  would bid Hearts had west passed then  no reason not to bid over double. It does not show extra values.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|
Kib: Would you approve  1@D bid by N instead  of 1@H with or without a double?
 
hondo717: yes, I think 1@D would have been a reasonable bid. Usually you bypass the diamond suit, but since her diamonds were so good, 1@D would be quite acceptable.|

hondo717: Now let me discuss a deceptive play that comes up quite often. From my perspective, the only Spade missing now is the @S10.  If North had the @S108, she would have led the @S10..  Therefore West has the @S10.  However, if West played the @S10, the @S3 would be missing, and I would not know whether Northe or West had it. 

onoway: right I should have played the 10.  
hondo717: Next, sally, you should play a high @D as a signal|

hondo717: When I lead back a @S for sally to ruff, I give a suit preference by the size of the @S I lead back.  A high Spades (as I led in this case), says lead back the higher of the non-trump suits (in this case @D.)  A low @S would have said lead back the lower of the non-trump suit –@C. |

hondo717: ok, one other somewhat advanced defensive technique I want to mention. When I lead back the 2nd Heart at trick 2, I lead back my "remaining count."  This means if I lead back a high Heart, I probably have a doubleton left (high low to show a doubleton.)  If I had led a low Heart back, I was showing that I have one or three left.

In this case, I led the 5 back, so I am showing either 1 or 3.  As it turns out, I had no choice.  Leading back remaining count really can help an advanced player defend well.|

hondo717: By bidding 2@H  East bid 4th suit forcing.  4th suit forcing is a good bid if you play it.  That means if 3 suits have been bid (as in this hand), and responder bids the 4th suit, it is an artificial bid.  It says, partner, I want to force us to game, but I am not sure which game yet  So in this case 2H was the 4th suit forcing and the best bid. 

2NT says you have an invitational hand with Hearts stopped. And the final bid is 3NT.|

cc1313: Partner systems on after the overcall. 

hondo717: sally, cc (West) is informing you that whatever she bids is same as if pam (North) had passed. Therefore, her 2@D  is transfer to Hearts. If West wanted to bid stayman, she would have doubled 2@C. That is known as a "stolen bid" double indicating North "stole" her stayman bid.|

pc|SK|pc|S5|pc|S3|pc|SA|nt|
hondo717: We  learn  2 things on this hand.  First, we learn how to deal with competition over a strong NT.  You play systems on and "stolen bid" double. So any bid by responder has the same meaning as if opps did not bid, and double says they "stole" my bid. 2nd, is DONT. That is a good convention for competing over NT. More on DONT on the next panel.|

pc|HA|pc|H2|pc|H3|pc|H4|nt|
hondo717: DONT, is a system for competing over a 1N bid.  If you have a single suited hand, you double.  This forces partner to bid 2@C, and then you pass with clubs and bid your suit otherwise.  If you have a 2 suited hand, you bid a suit.  Your bid shows that suit and a higher ranking suit.  So if you bid 2@C, you are showing clubs and an unspecified 2nd suit.  If you bid 2@D, you are showing diamonds and a major.  If you bid 2@H you are showing Hearts and Spades. Partner passes with at least 3 card support , otherwise  he bids the next higher suit.  With a 4-4 you should have opening points and as few as 10 with more distributional.|

hondo717: first of all let us discuss sally's (West) 3@C call.  It may seem aggressive, and it is, but it has a sound basis.  The rule is, if they have a fit, you probably have a fit too. So, since we have a diamond fit, it is likely West and East have some fit, and clubs seems a likely fit.  

When the hands are evenly divided, you should compete to the 3 level.  Even though sally does not have that many points, she knows that partner must have some points, since both North and I showed relatively weak hands, so the points have to be someplace.  In summary, good bid sally! Particularly not being vulnerable.
