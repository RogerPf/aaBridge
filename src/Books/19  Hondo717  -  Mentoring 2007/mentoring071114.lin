^d @e@2"nome" believes, "You need repetitions when you start bridge late." So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. 




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

Pear: Did I have a way to bid that? |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No, because you have no way of knowing you have a double fit. That is why jumping is sometimes good, because makes it hard to judge the hands. Further, both the @CK of and @HK of hearts are onside, and no way to know that. |

hondo717: Notice kia maximized his chances. he tried for the 10 of spades dropping, and a 3-3 diamond break. If those didn't work he still had club finesse to fall back on. So, although the contract was not cold, kia would have to be extremely unlucky for it not to make. |

PG| ***** 68 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: You could make a case for terry picking any suit to lead, so I have no problem with a spade. A heart could easily give away a trick, although on this hand it turns out to be the safest lead. But terry has no way of knowing that. |

hondo717: You might wonder why I don't play a spade and pitch a diamond. The problem is I only have one trump for the 2 diamonds in my hand, so pitching a diamond really does me no good. If I play a spade before drawing last trump, it will get ruffed. This way, I can still try the diamond finesse.|

hondo717: No terry, you can only make a negative double over an opening bid. So here you either have to bid spades or pass. I think terry's pass is best. With a singleton club and heart points, the hand looks like a possible misfit.|

hondo717: ok, then you should play your @CQ and not worry about the @Cs in dummy become winners. Because after winning the trick you can play another @C and have terry ruff one of the winners at least. |

AT|
Badmonster: But Nome will overtrump. |
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: True, but at least that way you take away a winner. And the club you are leading is a suit preference, so you would like diamonds by leading the 2 of clubs. |

hondo717: let us discuss kia's 3@D bid. It shows an invitational hand with diamonds. However, I think kia is strong enough to bid 4@H directly. He has 17 HCP 2 good suits, and lots of aces. His point count is 19 after re-evaluation. |

hondo717: Why does pass seem wrong? |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: Because Terry might have a huge hand and we might have a slam in some unmentioned suit!|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: True, and if you had more hearts, then I would be worried, but with a singleton heart, pass is pretty clear. With a real big hand, terry would double and correct. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


mb|p|sk|W|NT|
hondo717: Let me discuss double and correct. With 16+ and a really good suit, terry should double, and then correct whatever deb bids to his suit, So since he bid 3@H, his hand can't be all that good. Therefore, pass is probably best by you deb. Does that make sense to you? |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT| 
hondo717: Now let us look at terry's options. He could bid 3@H as he did, because he has a pretty good heart suit. He could double and hope deb does not bid diamonds. Or he could bid 4@C, which is Michaels, showing 5/5 in the majors. Now, terry, what do you think your best bid is?|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


AT|
Pear: I think overall ... considering everything ... 3@H's was my best risk ... 4@C's put me at a very high level. |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: I agree with terry's bid, although it turns out not to work on this hand, but in the long run, bidding a good suit works best. I would have bid 3@H with terry's hand, just as he did.|sk||

hondo717: The auction is very good except for the 5@S bid.  deb has a good 4@S bid, since she knows there is a 10 card fit. terry's bid is a little tougher, but with a singleton spade and 4 card support, 5@C is good. As a good "learning" experience I let it stand and let kia play it.|SB|E|SB|S|

hondo717: As it turns out, we can make 5@C if I guess the diamonds correctly. However, I am likely to get them wrong, playing for 2-2 rather than the finesse.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


at|
However, there are a couple of issues with kia's 5@S bid. Most importantly, once you preempt, you generally have told your story and do not speak again unless partner asks you to. In this case, kia does not know why deb bid 4@S. Perhaps she was preempting, perhaps she was hoping to double us. So, he should not bid 5@S since he is not sure what deb's intentions are. Additionally, he has nothing more than what he said. And in fact with an outside Ace has some defense.|

hondo717: ok, now here is an interesting dilemma for me. Since I am short in hearts, there is some chance that terry has a heart stack and was unable to bid. So a takeout double might work out. However, I also have a fairly weak hand, and 5 spades so I think 1@S is a better bid. Further, I do not think we can get rich playing 1@H doubled.|

hondo717: You were considering to double. What do you think your double could have meant terry?|

Pear: It means I can support your spades and I have a good hand. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No, that is not what it means. Your double here means you have a penalty double.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: As you already judged there are many other bids you can make to show spades, including 2@H to show a limit raise or better, or simply raising spades.  I suggest you limit your doubles to negative doubles and takeout doubles, and play most other doubles as penalty. If you want to play support doubles, that is ok as well.|

nome: Okay my dilemma is a poor hand but good support for the second suit bid by my partner.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, a 3@D is a bit aggressive, but certainly ok.  You know you have a 9 or 10 card fit, so it is safe to bid at the 3 level. |

hondo717: Now, a 3@S bid by me is stronger than a pass. since I already am known not to have an opening hand that is what I will bid. |

Now, terry, you have a great hand. you have a singleton diamond and the A of hearts, and good spades. 4@S  bid is pretty clear.|

hondo717: Note two important issues here. One, that had I trumped a heart before setting up clubs, I would have been down another trick. Second, in this hand for terry is to listen to the auction. his hand kept getting better as the auction proceeded. Once I bid spades, his hand was pretty good. And then once they bid diamonds, his diamond singleton was very good.|

Pear: Yes. |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Terry that is a good idea to splinter, but 3@H is a "jump shift", not a splinter. As you know a splinter (which shows trump support and shortness in the bid suit) is a double jump shift. So 4@H is how you splinter.|

hondo717: I played what is known as a "dummy reversal" on this hand. Typically, when you play a hand, you set up declarer's hand.  However, in this case I "reversed" the typical play, and set up dummy. The important point is I had a plan for this hand. As declarer, you should always try to develop a plan.|

hondo717: Now, I have 2 choices here. I can make a negative double, showing hearts and either diamonds or club support. However, in this case, a better bid is 2@H, because I have a good heart suit and 10 points. When you have a choice of bids, it is best to make the bid that imparts the most important information. In this case, I am judging that telling about my hearts and point count is most important.|

hondo717: kia's analysis in not bidding 3@S was good. Since he only has an 8 card fit, it is not a good idea to bid to the 3@S level, particularly since he also has clubs. If he had a singleton club, then one could make a case that 3@S was an ok bid.|

hondo717: Yes, a high heart asks for the higher no-trump suit (spades), low heart the lower suit (diamonds.)|

hondo717: Now let us discuss terry's 3@C bid. He had a bit of a problem over 2@S. He would like to show me long clubs. However, he has heart shortness, and some spade length. His clubs are ok, but not great. Given we are vul, I think pass might be better, hopefully, I can bid something over 2@S. And if not, we are probably ok anyway.|
