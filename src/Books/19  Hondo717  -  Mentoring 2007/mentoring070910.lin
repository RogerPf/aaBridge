^d @e@2"nome" believes, "You need repetitions when you start bridge late." So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.|

hondo717: ok, let's talk a little about the bidding.  Terry has 19 points. once anne responds, terry knows she has at least 6 points.  He now must take control of the bidding and force to game.  As opener, the only forcing bid he has available is a jump shift or reverse.
 
hondo717: Anyway, terry must make a forcing bid.  Once he bids 2N, anne knows for sure that their side has at least 25 points. she has 7, terry has 18, so the total is 25.  So 3N is the bid.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: now terry had a good question. He wanted to know why his 2@C bid is not forcing He thought a new suit was forcing.  The confusion has to do with when a new suit is forcing.  A new suit by responder is forcing.  So as long as responder keeps bidding new suits, opener must keep the bidding alive.  However, a new suit by opener, which terry is, is not forcing.  His  forcing bids are a reverse or jump shift.|

mc|12|nt|
hondo717: ok, let's talk about how to bid this hand.  Very difficult.  anne's 2@S bid was good, showing a limit raise or better in hearts.  With terry's singleton spade, and great heart suit he could bid 4@H.  however, another alternative would be for anne to make a splinter bid of 4@D, showing a singleton or void in diamonds.  several kibitzers suggested that.  Terry would still only bid 4@H, but anne would bid 5 clubs suggesting she is still interested in slam.  The problem is terry does not know whether anne has a singleton or void, so he cannot bid  6.  So some people play a splinter specifically shows a singleton.
|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: so let us go back to the auction as it was.  Once anne bids 2@S, terry wants to go to game. However, he can now bid 3@S, which agrees on hearts and shows spade shortness.  He might as well, since he was planning on bidding game anyway.  Once anne hears that, she can just bid 6. Basically, the problem is, anne wants to know about the spade shortness.  Otherwise she does not know whether or not she is losing 2 spade tricks.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|
Pear: I didn't know I could bid a q bid on top of a q bid.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: yes, terry, that is a very fancy bid.  Not expecting you to come up with it. Just discussing how an expert might bid it.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at| 
Pear: that isn't a mini-splinter is it Howard?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at|
hondo717: No. A mini-splinter is the way some people play splinters.  Some people splinter with  a limit raise and a singleton.  I play responder only splinters with an opening bid, but many experts will splinter with 10 points and a singleton  and that approach is known as a "mini-splinter."|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: Regarding your double sarah.  I certainly don't blame you for doubling the 6@H. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at| 
hondo717: However, because it is rare  to double a freely bid slam for penalty, some people play a conventional meaning to doubling a slam.  That approach is known as a "lightner double."  If experts double a slam, it says, partner, make an unusual lead. It usually shows a void.  So  here with my hand, if I knew that sarah was playing lightner doubles, I  would lead a diamond, expecting her to ruff it.  Of course, sarah does not know that convention.  I just mentioned it, because it is interesting  But it almost never comes up. I think it has come up twice in my 40 years of playing bridge.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|
Pear: Why a @D pls? ---  laz64md: how did you guess? |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|
hondo717: well, sarah, if you were to be void in a suit, since I have 5 diamonds, it is likely that is the suit.  Interesting hand, all around anyway. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|
Pear: so typically it's your Longest suit. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |

hondo717: ok, now deb's bid is known as "4th suit forcing". It does not necessarily show diamonds.  4th suit forcing says, partner we are forced to game. My next bid will clarify what is going on. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


at|
Terry should only bid 2N if he has diamonds. Opener is not sure what is going on until responder's next bid. 2@D by deb means the auction cannot stop below game and terry cannot pass.  Further,  if deb bids 3@C next (which she won't on this hand), you may not pass terry. I will discuss an alternate auction after the play of hand.|

Hondo717: Lead diamond.  Usually best to lead back Pard's suit.  Even if it is wrong, you can't lose the post mortem.  I had bad diamonds as it turns out, but you don't know that.|

hondo717: terry you played this brilliantly. First, let me talk about the auction a little bit. Fourth suit forcing is an advanced bidding convention, but very powerful if you play it. In a nut shell,  as I said, deb's 2@D bid says, "partner, we may not stop the bidding below game."  The next couple of bids will clarify what is going on. The partnership can bid slowly, confident in the fact that the hand will not be passed out below game.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: deb's 2 @D bid did not necessarily promise diamonds, although in this case she had diamonds.  Terry's best response is probably 3@C, rather than 2N, because he has such good clubs, and does not have a full diamond stopper.  Then deb can bid 3N (and hopefully play it as well as terry.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|
Now, hondo717: Now, let me discuss the play. Anne made a good play in ducking the heart, because otherwise hearts set up. However, terry found a brilliant counter move.  He pulled off what is known as a "squeeze."  By running off his heart and spade tricks, anne was stuck. She had to protect her K of hearts, otherwise all of deb's hearts were good.  However, she also had to protect clubs, otherwise terry's clubs were all good.  Since she couldn't protect both, terry was able to take all of the tricks.  Now, I don't expect you to play a squeeze on purpose!|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt| 
However, a good technique, when you have all the tricks but one, is to play out all your winners.
Often the opponents have discarding problems, as on this hand, and you end up with an extra trick
Running all your good tricks when you have only one loser left is always good technique.

pg| ***** 84 ***** |

Pear: is there a way to find 6NT here pls? |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|
hondo717: well, I discouraged deb from bidding, because it looked like you had a misfit.   And you could easily go down, losing a heart and a diamond.  In fact, were you in 6, anne would have taken the K of hearts, and you would have been down.|

hondo717: Now, let's talk about anne's DONT bid, which was good.  anne's 2@H bid is DONT. It shows a 2 suited hand, hearts and spades. Typically, you are 5/4 or 5/5, but you can be 4/4 if you have an opening hand.  South bids 2@S, because he only has 2@H, and anne might also only have 4. Because South  has 3@S  he knows that they are guaranteed to be in at least a 7 card fit.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: Basically, if your partner bids DONT, showing 2 suits, you pass with 3 card support, and bid the next suit up the line, with only 2 card support.  In this case, I specifically knew anne had hearts and spades, therefore, spades is anne's other suit. On the other hand,  had anne bid 2@C, showing clubs and another suit, or 2@D, showing diamonds and a major, I would not know what her other suit was.  In either case, with the hand I had, I would have passed, since I have at least 3 clubs, and at least 3@D. |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |

hondo717: however, if anne bid 2@C and, for example, I only had 2 clubs, I would bid 2@D, which anne would pass if diamonds were her suit. Otherwise she would bid her suit.  So that is how DONT works when you show 2 suits. Partner of DONT bidder passes with 3 card suit, bids the next suit up the line with 2 card support or less.|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

at|

nome: But only makes 4.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|

hondo717: We both have fits in 2 suits. we have fit in diamonds and spades.  They have fit in hearts and clubs.  Against perfect defense, they make 4@H and we make 4 spades.  However, in real life, if deb decides to bid 5@H, it turns out it makes, because of anne's singleton A of diamonds.|
Pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|

hondo717: Even if anne leads the A of diamonds, she cannot get to my hand to cash the 2 diamonds.  So deb can pitch her losing diamond on the club and will make 5.  As I discussed it in my  competitive bidding session, this hand shows you the power of having long trump suit.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |

Pear: It would be hard to find the 5@H bid I suppose? |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |

hondo717: Yes, it is a bit of a stretch on both yours and debs part, although given the vulnerability, it would not be unreasonable for either of you to bid it.|

hondo717: that is good play by deb. her best hope is terry has 2 club tricks, if she leads a diamond, I may be able to pitch losing clubs on diamonds. She knows her q of hearts is not cashing, because terry played low high, showing 3. If terry had a doubleton, he would have played high low, so deb then knows I started with 3, and terry with 2.  Terry, must get in the habit of correct defensive carding, really helps partner.|
