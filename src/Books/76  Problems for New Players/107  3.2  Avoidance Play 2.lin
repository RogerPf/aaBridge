fp|1|cp|2|
ht|g|at|^bAll the following hands are based on situations where you need to develop a suit without allowing the|
ht|h|at|^bdangerous hand to gain the lead. But as opposed to the hands in part one of this topic, your holding in|
ht|i|at|^bthe suit you want to establish does not contain a finessing combination or it contains only a finesse that|
ht|j|at|^bwould lose to the dangerous hand. In this case you need a special treatment to force the safe hand to|
ht|k|at|^bwin the trick with a missing honor, thereby establishing your suit safely.|
ht|m|fp|1|at|^bA Guideline for all the hands included in this movie:|
ht|n|fp|1|at|^bBe always on the look-out whether or not a defender may risk your game by taking control of the|
ht|o|at|^bled suit or by shifting to a suit in which your holding is vulnerable.| 
ht|q|at|^bBefore playing to trick one, identify the dangerous opponent. This will give you the ideas about:|
ht|s|at|^c1. Whether or not it is essential to hold up to exhaust the short-suit holder of his cards in the led suit.|
ht|u|at|^c2. How to proceed with your play to prevent the dangerous opponent from gaining the lead.|

ht|f|at|As each deal progresses you will be shown:  your hand, the bidding, the lead and then given a chance to think about your plan.

When you now click  { ^*b Flow  > ^*c } or better still use your mouse wheel (or trackpad) to SCROLL forward one place, the  { ^*b 1st > ^*c }  button becomes visible.  This means you can play the hand against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots.

When you have finished, click the  { ^*b Back to Moive ^*c }  button which will return you to where you were in the tutorial.

The first time you play the hand you have do so without any extra assistance from aaBridge, this mode of play is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n plays as much as you like.   

|n^|9|at|After that you get a second chance to play the hand but this time you have access to the ^*b DDS ^*n (Double Dummy Solver) and other features such as; making all the hands visible.

|n#|3|at|After holding up your @sA for the obligatory 3 times, you need to stop East getting in to cash his @ss  AND  set up your @d's.    The best way to do this is to play for West to hold @dQx(x) and to lead twice TOWARDS the  @dAK ducking ONLY if West plays the @dQ.  (You have the @hK with which to return to hand the 2nd time).

|n#|3|at|Putting East with 6@hs and therefore West with the killer @cs.  The only hope of a 9th is to find a 3-3 @s split with West holding @sQxx.   Even with this you still have to stop West from unblocking her @sQ and so evetually letting East in with the @sJ.  So as before, win trick 1 and lead twice towards the @sAK ducking if you see the @sQ.

|n#|3|at|After winning the 2nd @h you need to set up the @cs.  Lead low towards the @cK and if West plays low, cover with the @c8.  This way you can lose a trick to East who, if West started with 5 @hs, will not have one to return.  
Win the @d return and attack the @c's West will now only get in once more (with a @c) so you will come to 9.
