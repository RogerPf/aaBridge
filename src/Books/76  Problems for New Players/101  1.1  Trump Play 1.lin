mn|Introduction to Trump Play  -  Part 1|
tu|y|

bt||
ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThe bidding often designates a suit as the trump suit and that suit becomes the trump suit 
^bfor the entire hand.

^bPlaying in a suit contract is, in many ways, similar to playing in a No trump contract. 

^bThe first step is to make a plan before playing a card to the first trick. 

^bYou still have to consider the best way of taking what you deserve. 

^bYou may have to play a suit with more cards on one side than the other in the right order – the 
^bhigh card from the short side. 

^bYou must focus on your goal so that you are not tempted to jeopardize the contract in an attempt 
^bto get an extra trick which you don't need. 

^bOther than that, it is quite straightforward. If you don't have the number of tricks you need, 
^byou can try to develop extra tricks by promoting winners in your solid suits, by establishing 
^bthe small cards in long suits or by finessing against higher cards than you hold in a suit.

^bWe have seen that there are similarities between playing No trump and suit contracts.

^bLet's now consider the differences.|

ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThe trump suit does have an effect on your priorities. You may have all the tricks you need, 
^bfor example, and yet, if you don't play the trump suit first, you may find one of your sure tricks 
^bloses to an opponent's small trump card. 

^bHowever, on many hands you cannot afford to draw the trumps because other things take priority.
^bFor example: you may need to ruff losers in dummy or discard a loser before the defenders 
^bgain the lead, and sometimes you must keep a trump entry in dummy.    

^bThe first step in playing a hand in a suit contract is to consider your goal. 

^bIf your contract is 4@H, for instance, you need ten tricks -- In a contract of 6@D, you need 
^btwelve tricks. 

^bAfter you have stopped to consider your goal, the next step is to discover how close you are to 
^bachieving this goal. In other words, you need to know how many losers you can afford and still make 
^byour contract. 

^bIf you are in a contract of 4@S, you can afford three losers. In a contract of 6@C, you can afford 
^bonly one loser.

^bWhen you compare the number of losers you can afford to the number of losers you have and find 
^bthat you have too many losers, you want to organize a way to get rid of your extra losers (the losers 
^byou can't afford).|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThere are two methods of getting rid of losers in a suit contract that are not available in a 
^bNo-trump contract. 

^cOne way of getting rid of losers in your hand is to ruff them in dummy. 

^cThe second way is to discard your losers by using dummy's strength in 
^canother suit.

^bWe will develop these methods in more detail in our lessons, but here are the general ideas:

^bThere are two main groups of losers:
^b1.   ^cQuick (or immediate) losers – tricks that can be won by the defenders 
^cwhenever they get the lead.

^b2.   ^cSlow (or eventual) losers – tricks that cannot be taken immediately by 
^cthe defenders, but will be eventually lost if you don't take care of them.

^bYou should also distinguish between two sub types of losers :
^ca. ^dInevitable: certain losers that the defenders can win at will --  nothing you do 
^dwill erase this loser.

^cb. ^dConditional: losers that you can avoid by ruffing, discarding or finessing.

^bAs you can't do anything about your inevitable losers, you must pay a primary attention to 
^byour conditional losers.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThat means:

^b1. ^cRecognizing and counting them.

^b2. ^cPreserving the required number of trumps to ruff them.

^b3. ^cLooking for extra winners in dummy that can be used for discard.

^b4. ^cIf possible, preventing the defenders from gaining the lead before you get rid 
^cof your extra losers.

^bRemember: you should always plan your play, and you must do that BEFORE touching a single card!!!

^b1. ^cCount your losers, start with the trump suit.

^b2. ^cVerify your losers (quick/slow – inevitable/conditional).

^b3. ^cRelate your loser count to the contract to learn how many losers you can afford.

^b4. ^cIf you have too many losers, plan how to get rid of them, while preserving the required entries.

^b5. ^cAsk yourself whether or not you can afford drawing trumps immediately – completely or partly.

^b6. ^cHaving decided on your plan, put it into operation.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||
ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bRuffing in the hand where the long trump is placed, is generally not a good way to win trump tricks. 

^bFrequently, especially when confronting unfavorable trump division in the defenders' hands, it may 
^bcause you to lose control of the game.

^bMost of the time you can gain tricks only by ruffing your losers in the hand that has the shorter trump 
^bholding.

^BFor that reason, you should also count your losers from the viewpoint of the hand that has the longer 
^btrump holding, usually the declarer's. We call this hand the "MASTER-HAND".

^bThe hand with the longer trump holding serves also as a controlling hand. 

^bIt is because the trumps in this hand can be used to draw the outstanding trumps and to prevent the 
^bdefenders from taking enough tricks to defeat your contract.

^bFor that reason, you can't have more losers in a suit than the number of cards you hold in this suit in 
^bthe Master-Hand.|

When you now click  { ^*b Flow  > ^*c } or better still use your mouse wheel (or trackpad) to SCROLL forward one place, the  { ^*b 1st > ^*c }  button becomes visible.  This means you can play the hand against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots.

When you have finished, click the  { ^*b Back to Moive ^*c }  button which will return you to where you were in the tutorial.

The first time you play the hand you have do so without any extra assistance from aaBridge, this mode of play is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n plays as much as you like.

|n#|3|at|You don't need the trumps for your plan and can play them without giving up the lead. Draw trumps first and then play the diamonds  for the discard.  There is no need to put your contract under a risk by trying the club finesse at this stage. First things first, you have to assure your contract. Later, you can try the finesse, seeking an overtrick.
