mn|    Planning the play in No-trumps:      Holding up with Two Stoppers  -  Part 1|
tu|y|fp|1|cp|2|
ht|f|at|^bIt is sometimes correct to hold up at trick one even though you hold two certain stoppers in the|
ht|g|at|^bsuit that has been led. It is likely to be right when you have two high cards to knock out and|
ht|h|at|^byou want to exhaust one of the defenders' cards in the suit led. Then, after you perform the|
ht|i|at|^bhold up play, it is in general best to attack first the entry of the defender who holds the long suit.|
ht|j|at|^bAs in all other hold up types, holding up with two stoppers often leaves you vulnerable to a switch.|
ht|l|fp|1|at|^bWhen you can't control the order in which the defenders gain the lead (i.e. when you miss| 
ht|m|at|^btwo Aces or an Ace and a King in one suit), it is essential to hold up at trick one to eventually| 
ht|n|at|^bexhaust the short-suit holder of his card in the led suit.|
ht|o|at|^bWhen you can choose the order in which the defenders gain the lead (i.e. you miss one Ace and| 
ht|p|at|^ba finesseable King), there is no need to hold up at trick one. You can then attack the entry to the|
ht|q|at|^bdanger hand, hold up on the second round if needed, and then let the safe defender gain the lead.|
ht|r|at|^bBefore deciding on hold up play, be on the look-out whether or not defender may risk your game| 
ht|s|at|^bby shifting to another suit.|
ht|u|at|^bThis movie is designed to allow you first to make your plan with both defenders' hands closed.|
ht|v|at|^bUse this ^$40 to get the auction and the opening lead, and this ^$41 to move to the next deal.|
ht|w|at|^bThen you will find the same set of deals with all four hands visible. This will allow you to check whether|
ht|x|at|^byour plan was correct and to play through all the possible variations, including the defense options.|
ht|y|at|^bLater, you may go to the last page to find the solutions.|

ht|f|at|As each deal progresses you will be shown:  your hand, the bidding, the lead and then given a chance to think about your plan.

When you now click  { ^*b Flow  > ^*c } or better still use your mouse wheel (or trackpad) to SCROLL forward one place, the  { ^*b 1st > ^*c }  button becomes visible.  This means you can play the hand against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots.

When you have finished, click the  { ^*b Back to Moive ^*c }  button which will return you to where you were in the tutorial.

The first time you play the hand you have do so without any extra assistance from aaBridge, this mode of play is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n plays as much as you like.   

|n^|9|at|After that you get a second chance to play the hand but this time you have access to the ^*b DDS ^*n (Double Dummy Solver) and other features such as; making all the hands visible.

For more information on these features including |cp|red|at|^*b YouTube Videos ^*n |cp||at|on the ^*b DDS ^*n and playing the hand.

|n#|3|at|Unless the @hs split 4-3, if you play the @hA on the first round you will go down.  So it is safest to duck the first round and then round play for East, the Opp with the 2nd @c stop, to just have two @hs.
