Our thanks go to ^c@2 
@.  ^*bAngel Blue^*n,  @b@2bridge teacher on BBO,  for allowing us to use this collection hands here in the
	|fp|t|at|Beginners  / |fp||at|New Player      section.|fp||at|
	
^c@2Those who are familiar with Arik's work, much of which he has kindly allowed to be included in later sections, 
^d see under          ^*b menubar ^*n       >     ^*bBooks-L^*n       >       ^*b Writer  -  Angel Blue      . . .^*n  
know that he can set tough problems.  But those included here fit best in the  "for New Players"  category.|

Clicking in the left hand column allows you to jump to the Chapters and parts of Chapters that form this book.
Once in a chapter you can click  ANYWHERE  on the ^*b Navbar ^*n at the bottom  (NOT just on the bumps).
