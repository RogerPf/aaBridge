at|^bThe last two deals in  1.2  showed the wisdom of making a plan BEFORE YOU PLAY TO THE FIRST TRICK. 

^bThere are two main strategies of planning a bridge hand.

^bThe first is the strategy of "I will play the cards and see what will happen". 

^bIn other words: let's wait until things have gone badly wrong. Then, at around trick five, you sit back in 
^byour chair and wonder if you can retrieve the situation. This is of course a false strategy!

^bThe second strategy is to start the process of planning immediately after the opening lead appears on 
^bthe table and BEFORE PLAYING A SINGLE CARD FROM DUMMY.

^bIt is an undisputed fact of life at the bridge table, that victories are not achieved by some accidental fall of 
^bthe cards at tricks 10, 11, 12, or 13. 

^bFar more often than you can imagine, bridge games are won or lost right at the opening lead, when the 
^bdefenders launch their initial attack.

^bWhat happens at trick one often leads to victory or defeat. The correct play is made, and victory becomes 
^bguaranteed. However, when an incorrect play is made, defeat may become unavoidable. 

^bIf, for instance, you win the opening lead in the wrong hand or with the wrong card, or fail to hold up an Ace 
^bor King when you should, or hold up when you should not, more often than not there can be no recovery 
^band no escape.|

ht|g|cp|2|fp|1|at|^bThe first trick is not merely the play of four cards, one by each player. 

^bThere is a background in the bidding. There is a context created by the visible cards, presumed layout 
^band distribution of the hidden cards and the expectable location of honors and/or high-spot cards.

^bConsequently, there is the effect on the outcome of the remaining twelve tricks.



^j     @S@H@D@C    SUMMARY    @S@H@D@C

^bThis article was mainly about counting losers and handling them. 

^bBut it was also designed to show you, that the only way to make your mistakes worthwhile, is 
^bto appreciate them for what they are: precious lessons that can only be learned the hard way. 

^bThus, the key question is not whether you make or fail to make your contract, but what you take with 
^byou afterward: the moral each deal offers, the benefit of learning a new aspect of the game, the 
^bopportunity to promote your judgment and to upgrade your card sense, and your willingness to apply 
^bnew elements into your future games. 

^bThe reward would be quite substantial.
