ht|f|at|As each deal progresses you will be shown:  your hand, the bidding, the lead and then given a chance to think about your plan.

When you now click  { ^*b Flow  > ^*c } or better still use your mouse wheel (or trackpad) to SCROLL forward one place, the  { ^*b 1st > ^*c }  button becomes visible.  This means you can play the hand against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots.

When you have finished, click the  { ^*b Back to Moive ^*c }  button which will return you to where you were in the tutorial.

The first time you play the hand you have do so without any extra assistance from aaBridge, this mode of play is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n plays as much as you like.   

|n^|9|at|After that you get a second chance to play the hand but this time you have access to the ^*b DDS ^*n (Double Dummy Solver) and other features such as; making all the hands visible.

tu|y|

ht|e|
at|^^^bThe last two deals in  1.2  showed the wisdom of making a plan BEFORE YOU PLAY TO THE FIRST TRICK. 

^bThere are two main strategies of planning a bridge hand.

^bThe first is the strategy of "I will play the cards and see what will happen". 

^bIn other words: let's wait until things have gone badly wrong. Then, at around trick five, you sit back in 
^byour chair and wonder if you can retrieve the situation. This is of course a false strategy!

^bThe second strategy is to start the process of planning immediately after the opening lead appears on 
^bthe table and BEFORE PLAYING A SINGLE CARD FROM DUMMY.

^bIt is an undisputed fact of life at the bridge table, that victories are not achieved by some accidental fall of 
^bthe cards at tricks 10, 11, 12, or 13. 

^bFar more often than you can imagine, bridge games are won or lost right at the opening lead, when the 
^bdefenders launch their initial attack.

^bWhat happens at trick one often leads to victory or defeat. The correct play is made, and victory becomes 
^bguaranteed. However, when an incorrect play is made, defeat may become unavoidable. 

^bIf, for instance, you win the opening lead in the wrong hand or with the wrong card, or fail to hold up an Ace 
^bor King when you should, or hold up when you should not, more often than not there can be no recovery 
^band no escape.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||

ht|e|cp|2|fp|1|at|^^^bThe first trick is not merely the play of four cards, one by each player. 

^bThere is a background in the bidding. There is a context created by the visible cards, presumed layout 
^band distribution of the hidden cards and the expectable location of honors and/or high-spot cards.

^bConsequently, there is the effect on the outcome of the remaining twelve tricks.

^j     @S@H@D@C    SUMMARY    @S@H@D@C

^bThis article was mainly about counting losers and handling them. 

^bBut it was also designed to show you, that the only way to make your mistakes worthwhile, is 
^bto appreciate them for what they are: precious lessons that can only be learned the hard way. 

^bThus, the key question is not whether you make or fail to make your contract, but what you take with 
^byou afterward: the moral each deal offers, the benefit of learning a new aspect of the game, the 
^bopportunity to promote your judgment and to upgrade your card sense, and your willingness to apply 
^bnew elements into your future games. 

^bThe reward would be quite substantial.


^l ^*BIn other words...^*N

^iWHEN YOU LOSE, DON'T LOSE THE LESSON!
