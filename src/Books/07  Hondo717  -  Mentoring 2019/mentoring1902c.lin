UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main point here is to play ^*bBergen Raises^*N ^*g:Bergen Raises::Core Bidding, (LINK  -  Bergen Raises)^*n. 
It makes it hard for the opponents to compete. On this hand, not playing Bergen Raises, West bids 2@S and East passes. Then North/South will compete and be able to exchange information.|

PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But by playing Bergen Raises, you gain 2 advantages:
^ca) partner has a pretty precise idea of your fit and point count and can accurately judge whether or not to bid game
^Cb) you make it hard for the opponents to compete.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are two common arguments against them. One is it might get you too high. That argument is a fallacy if playing against good opponents Because, they will never let you play at the 2 level. So you will end up at the 3 level in any case.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other argument is that sometimes over 3@C or 3@D you can make a lead directing double. That is true, but not really that important.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best argument for Bergen Raises is you make a weak jump raise with a weak hand making it very hard for the opponents to compete when they have a lot of strength.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I used to think Reverse Bergen was better. The reason being that it gives you more room to explore when trying to decide whether or not to bid game. And it is more likely you might want to bid game opposite a 10-12 raise than a 7-9 raise.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in a conversation with Marty Bergen he said, "He is indifferent." But he does say that it is usually easier for opener to unilaterally decide whether or not to bid game over a 10-12 raise than over a 7-9 raise.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if anything you want more room to explore over a 7-9 raise. But basically it makes no difference.|

mb|1D?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I love to overcall 2@C over 1@D to make it hard for responder to bid and will strain to do so. But this hand is a little weak to overcall 2@C particularly vulnerable. I love the 5-4-3-1 distribution but my club suit is pretty weak and I only have 7 HCP.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think pass is clearly best. If I was not vul and you made my @HA the @CA then I might cheat and bid 2@C because AK987 is a nice suit And that is about the only time I would do so with 7 HCP|mb|P|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your hand meets the rule of 20. Admittedly it is about as weak as it could be. Also, you have the vulnerability rule backwards. You want to strain to open when vulnerable because it is much more dangerous to compete later on.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So get your bid in now while the auction is still low. When not vul, it is much less dangerous to come in later.|

mb|P|mb|2CD|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure I would make a lead directing double with the North hand, but I like the fact that North thought about it. You should make a lead directing double when you can.|

mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|MB|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to invite. Bid 3@S. You don't want to bid 4@S if partner has a minimum hand. But if partner has 14 or good 13 you do want to be in game. So bid 3@S to invite 4@S.|

mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your hand does not meet the rule of 20. If you want to open light in 3rd seat, that is fine. I am not a fan of opening light, but many are. In 1st and 2nd seat, rule of 20 is what you should use. So pass is ok, especially at unfavorable vulnerability (EW vul, NS not).|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Everyone including experts have trouble defending. It requires a great deal of thought and detective work and is extremely difficult. 

But one good principle is, when declarer is 2 suited and you are long in their 2nd suit leading trump is a good idea.|
