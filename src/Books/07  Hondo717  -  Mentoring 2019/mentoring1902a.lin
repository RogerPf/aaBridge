UP|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me talk a little about what is called "suit combinations" and in particular, in this board, talk about how to play the diamond suit. Suit combinations are a very complicated subject and require a lot of thought to figure out the best way to play certain combinations of cards.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If diamonds are 2-2, then North will only lose 1 diamond trick. The question is, are there any other situations where North only loses 1 diamond. The answer is yes. In fact, this hand demonstrates that. If East has a singleton honor (@DK or @DQ), North can cash the @DA first then get to dummy and lead towards the @DJ.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That play works even if diamonds are 2-2 but gives declarer the extra chance when they are 3-1 with East holding a singleton honor.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing a suit combination correctly is difficult and requires a lot of thought. It is almost impossible to memorize all suit combinations as there are almost an infinite variety. But what you can do is use logic to figure out a good way to play a suit. As you gain more experience, you can logically figure out a good way to play most suits.|

There is a rare bid that East can make if playing 2/1 game forcing. East's correct bid is 3@S not 2@S. It is rare that you want to jump in a game forcing auction. But there are a few cases where it is well defined. This is one of them.|

mb|3S|
nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 3@S bid by East in 2/1.  It says @-
^^^c@2"Partner I don't care how many spades you have. Spades are trump because I have a self-sufficient suit with at most one loser.  Please start control bidding unless you have a very weak game forcing hand with lots of quacks and few aces and kings."|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West certainly has a nice hand and should control bid.|mb|4C|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P4D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What East should do at this point? 4@D is possible to show a diamond control. But East knows their side has all suits controlled. So "she who knows goes" is one common bridge expression meaning at this point, East can just bid RKCB if she likes. So either 4@D or 4N is possible. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even if East had bid 4@D she was intending to bid 4N even if West bid 4@S. But let us undo the 4@D and let East bid 4N.|UB||
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|4N|mb|P|mb|5H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a very clearcut rule once you bid RKCB as to whether or not you bid slam. Once you bid RKCB, you have decided you want to bid slam unless you lack key cards or trump control. 
You should bid at least 6 if:
   a) You have 4 key cards and the trump queen; or
   b) You have all 5 key cards.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand East knows they have 4 key cards and the trump queen so she should bid 6@S. You should only bid 6 if you have 5 keys and are missing the trump queen. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example if East had the AKJ10xx of spades, then they would have had all the keys but were missing the @SQ and East should still only bid 6. But certainly with all the keys and the trump queen, East can look for 7.|MB|6S|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*CLead for South by clicking that card on the right.^^H3^S8754HQ63CT92DJ97|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against all grand slams and 6NT you make a "passive" lead, a lead where you are trying not to give away a trick. For example if you have a long weak suit, that is a good lead. Or if you have some modest sequence like J109 or 1098 top of a sequence is a good lead.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| However, against a suit you want to make an aggressive lead, hoping to set up a fast trick for your side. In a slam the declarer has most of the resources and left to their own devices are most likely to lose at most one trick if you make a passive lead.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So against 6 of a suit, you want to try and set up a fast trick by leading away from a king or a queen, for example, in an unbid suit. So here, a heart lead by me makes sense. Not because it happens to be the best lead but because I am trying to set up a fast trick. You will notice if I lead anything but a heart, 6@S makes easily.|

PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sb|s|mb|4S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good tactical bid, Theoretically East could show a limit+ raise by bidding 2@D. However, slam is unlikely and East knows they should to be in game. So 4@S crowds the auction and makes it hard for me to know what to do.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a singleton spade and doubleton heart it would be easy. And I don't know that North's double was somewhat of an overbid. Theoretically, it is the legal way for him to bid 1@H. But had West passed, North would have bid 2@H, weak jump shift, not 1@H.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why double is a bit of an overbid. Not that I hate the bid, just saying it was a stretch. As suggested by one of the kibs I could bid 4NT in case partner had clubs. In fact, I like that.|mb|4N|

If diamonds are 3-2 then you can develop an extra diamond. But you need to hope that you can take an extra club for your 9th trick.|

mb|1C|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid by East, particularly at favorable vulnerability. East doesn't love his hand as it lacks any shortness and the suit is mediocre. However, the preempt is still best.|

mb|3C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|MB|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 3@H is a questionable bid. Basically, you need to follow the law of total tricks. EW have a 7 card heart fit. So you don't want to be in a 9 trick contract. It is possible they have a diamond fit. But it is hard to know.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not likely since, once East shows 6 hearts, the most likely number of cards in any of the side suits is 2.

My first choice is 4@H, 2nd choice is 1@H and 3rd choice is 3@H. I like 4@H because I think that is most likely contract. 1@H is ok because East has 2 aces and a nice hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is sort of the lesser choice because with 7-4-2-0 distribution it is likely that, despite only having 7 hearts, the hand is worth more tricks than it might otherwise seem.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. As I said, although the bidding was reasonable, it did turn out that 4@H was the best contract. Further, opening 4@H would have worked out as well. And might have worked better if NS were able to compete. I am not saying you should always preempt particularly when it means you might miss a slam.|
