up|24|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure I would play the hand this way. If hearts don't break 2-2 West has lost entries to their clubs If the clubs don't come in. I would probably test clubs first. 

But the way the cards are laid out, West always make 6. The 4@H bid was a very nice bid. It illustrates the power of distribution. West only has 12 working HCP (the @SQ is worthless and might as well be the @S2).|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the West hand is worth way more than 12 points particularly once West knows their side has a heart fit.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, I think NS being not vul should bid 4@S over 4@H. In a competitive auction 4@S is almost always right over 4@H with a 9-card fit. N/W are down2 or 3 losing 2 hearts, 2 clubs and 1 diamond and perhaps a diamond ruff. Not vul 4@S doubled at -300 or -500 is better than their making -680.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*NHoward, is East hand worth a 2@H bid over 1@S or is the dbl better?|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East really need 10 points to bid 2@H. Sometimes I stretch but I wouldn't with the East hand. I don't like the 5-3-3-2 distribution. I don't like the weakish hearts (although the intermediate 10 and 8 are nice). And I don't like holding 3 cards in the opponents suit unless the suit has been raised.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3 cards is the worst holding you can have in an opponents suit. On this hand, the opponents happen to have a 9 card spade fit. But on many hands they would have a 7 card fit and E/W could easily have 3 spade losers.So remember that 3 cards in the opponents suit, when it has not been raised, is a bad holding and is a downgrade.|

East plays Checkback Stayman which is what I prefer. In this case 3@C is similar to New Minor Forcing. It is asking about majors. Both Checkback Stayman and NMF are alertable.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular auction, East is asking about West's majors but West might have 4 spades. With 4 spades and a balanced 18-19 West would still bid 2N as West did. This is in contrast to the auction 1@C-1@H-1N in which West could not have 4 spades because West would have bid 1@S over 1@H.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with a 2N bid, West can have 4 spades. Over 1N, Checkback or NMF guarantees 5 hearts but over 2N, it does not. East might have 5 hearts and less than 4 spades, might have 4 hearts and 4 spades, or might even have 5 hearts and 4 spades. So West must take that all into account.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|p?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 3 hearts West bids 3@H. With 4 spades West bids 3@S.

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played, The only minor point I want to make is the club suit. There are actually 2 ways to play clubs. You can either play the 2 top clubs and a 3rd club. That works any time clubs are 3-3 or the queen or jack is doubleton. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other choice is to finesse twice in clubs hoping south has at least one club honor. I personally like the AK approach as it is easier and requires no extra entries to dummy.|
