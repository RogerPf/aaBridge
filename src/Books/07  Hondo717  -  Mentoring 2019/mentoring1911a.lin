nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, it is possible I will be ruffing the club. So the @C5 is suit preference, the higher club meaning you are interested in the higher remaining suit (hearts as opposed to diamonds in this case). Regardless, I will let the @C2 stand.|

mb|1S|mb|P1n|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We play 2/1 game forcing at this table. West has a clear 2@C game forcing bid. 1NT shows 6-9 usually and no more than 11, so it is a big underbid in any system. I will undo the bid.|

mb|2C|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H by East is correct. You want to look for your major suit fit. If East bid 2@D, then 2@H by West is not natural. It is just a 4th suit "waiting bid." |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is artificial, asking East to further describe the hand (often looking for a stopper in the unbid suit). Therefore, if East bid 2@D they could easily miss a heart fit on this hand playing 2/1.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should bid 3@H, not 4@H. E/W are already forced to game. So 4@H is called "fast arrival", meaning it shows no extra values.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on this hand, West has slam interest if East has more than a minimum. 3@H by West, going slowly, shows that interest.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East was interested in slam, she would control bid. But with a void in clubs and a minimum hand, she should simply bid 4@H.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And West can now pass, confident that slam is unlikely. That is one of the big advantages of 2/1 game forcing. It allows you to look for slam while staying below game.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have some choices as to opening lead. I could lead a trump because, when dummy shows a preference for one suit over another of opener's, dummy is usually short in the 2nd suit and I want to cut down on ruffs. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And on this auction, an 8-card heart fit is very likely. The other possibility is a diamond lead, the unbid suit. Under no circumstances should I lead a spade since East bid them. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, you should avoid leading suits the opponents bid on opening lead. The only exception is if you have a singleton and likely trump trick. So, I will lead a heart.|

Probably not. But his hand is much better than it looks after the 3@S bid, which should show a very good suit (usually a nice 6-card suit or even a 7-card suit sometimes). |

mb|2H?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a great hand. It has 8 likely tricks at least (6 spades and 2 aces). Or looking at it another way, I have only 5 losers. It's certainly possible partner can cover 4 of the losers. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if partner has 2 spades and some honors in clubs and diamonds, 6 might make. But that is unlikely. As a general rule, if the opponents open with a preempt, worry about getting to game but don't worry about missing slam. |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand I am going to bid 4@S. That makes it more difficult for the opponents and is probably where I want to end up.|mb|4S|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has a clear pass. There are very few hands where North should bid on this auction since my 4@S is probably to play and I could have a wide range of hands.|mb|P|

pc|HA|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It looks like I have a diamond loser and a spade loser (if spades are 3-2) for sure. And the contract hinges on the club finesse. Further, I would like to try and set up diamonds. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I only have one sure entry to dummy and I need 2 to set up diamonds, 1 to get there to ruff a diamond and a 2nd to get to the diamonds that are set up. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also have the potential for a club/diamond squeeze against West or East for that matter. If the person with the @CQ has 3 diamonds, then I might be able to squeeze them. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the club finesse is better percentage. So I am going to play for a 3-2 spade fit and the club finesse. In addition, I can mess around in diamonds in case something good happesn (such as a singleton honor or KQ doubleton).|
