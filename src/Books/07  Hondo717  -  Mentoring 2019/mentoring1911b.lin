up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding was fine. As to the play West chose an interesting way to play the spade suit. It happened to work. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the higher percentage way to play the suit is to lead low to the @SA and low back towards the hand. That works whenever South has a doubleton honor or goes up with the King (which many players will) or has the @SJ. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although the spade play worked, it is probably not the best way to play the suit in the long run. West was also lucky that North ducked the @CA.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear whether North should do so (although playing 2nd hand low quickly, as North did, is good technique in general). But given the way West played the hand, I might have done so.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should leave the @HA in dummy after winning the @SA and lead a heart to the hand and a low club.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North ducks, West can play the @CK and if North does not duck, then the @CK can be used to discard a diamond. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since the @DA is onside, once West plays the spades the way she did, then the contract will always make. The way it was played, if North takes the @CA and leads a heart after cashing the @SK, West could end up losing 1 spade, 1 club, and 3 diamond tricks and go down 2.|

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|P|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H is a possible bid and I don't think it is necessarily wrong. It does have the advantage of being slightly preemptive but it presumably shows 3 hearts and 6-9 points. |

up|33|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should really bid 3@D on this auction. If the opponents are in an 8-card fit at the 2-level you will often not get a good result. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So West should bid 3@D to take us out of 2@H. As it turns out we make 3@H so if we bid 3@H over 3@D it works out for NS. In 3@D, EW will lose 1 spade, 1 heart and 3 clubs for down 1.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs it doesn't matter much. But in Matchpoints -50 (3@D won't be doubled) is better than -140. Plus sometimes we can only make 2@H and not 3@H and if we bid 3@H and go minus that works out very well for EW.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The principle here is, if the auction indicates the opponents have an 8-card fit and are willing to stop at the 2-level do everything you can to take them out of their comfortable 2 level contract.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|pc|s4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once I lead a spade, East can count 4 spade winners, 2 hearts, and 2 minor suit aces for 8 sure tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, East needs to worry about entries. Therefore, after winning the @SQ,|pc|s2sjsq|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


AT| East should lead the @S9 to take the 4 spade tricks.|pc|s9|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


AT| Then East can knock out the @HA and guarantee 8 tricks. And if hearts break 3-3, East could end up with 10 tricks.|
