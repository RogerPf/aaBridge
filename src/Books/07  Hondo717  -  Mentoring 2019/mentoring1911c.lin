mb|P|mb|P|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 1st or 2nd seat, East should open 1@H. However, in 3rd seat, sometimes it is a good idea to preempt even with a minimum opener because 4th seat probably has some points and you want to make it harder for 4th seat to bid. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is a good principle to remember. If the first 2 players pass, they usually average a combined 16 HCP or so. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, 3rd and 4th seat have a combined 24 HCP or so. Since East has 12 HCP, there is a good chance South has 12 or more HCP. Thus, a preempt by East makes it harder for South, the 4th seat, to bid in general.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, opening a 2-bid in 4th seat. It turns out that if it went P-P-P to East, he should also open 2@H (a 2-bid). An opening 2-bid in 4th seat is NOT a weak-2. It shows a nice 6-card suit and a min opening hand (10-13 HCP or so).|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nHoward I'd like to see some justification for this claim. It is not intuitively obvious. I would think the first two players had about 10 points each.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen has a statistical guru who figured out that 16 points is the average number of HCP when there are 2 passes. Not sure why you think each player should average 10 HCP, especially considering that these days some 10 HCP hands are opened because of the rule of 20 (e.g. they might have 5-5 or 6-4 distribuion).|

mb|p|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in Match Points it is possible we can make 4 of a minor. However, I will reluctantly pass. But I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't work out well for our side.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So they did make 6. I have been in worse slams. East had a maximum, it needed 3-2 diamonds (or 4-1 with North having 4 diamonds), and the working spade finesse.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That sort of bid doesn't come up all that much but it is good to know. If you bid a forcing NT and then bid a new suit that shows a weak hand with a long suit, a weak 2-bid in the suit if you will.|
