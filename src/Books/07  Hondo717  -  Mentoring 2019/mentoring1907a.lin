That is what I recommend. I don't really understand why more don't play it.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We are playing 2/1 game forcing. So we are forced to game.In my opinion, North is strong enough to bid 2@C game forcing. My rule on marginal hands is, if you have an opener you can bid a game force.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some might argue that if you discount the @SQ doubleton by one point the North hand does not meet the rule of 20. But since I opened 1@S, no reason to discount the @SQ. And, therefore, North does meet the rule of 20.|

mb|P|mb|2D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should bid either 2N or 3@D. My choice is 3@D. We are in a game force. The whole idea is to go slowly.|mb|3D|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since we have agreed on diamonds. I am going to bid 3@S. Tthat does not show a 6th spade. It is one of two things. It is either an attempt to play 3N if North has a heart stopper or it might be a control bid.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


mb|3s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should assume I am looking for 3N. But if I bid over 3N then it was a control bid. So North should bid 3N with the hearts stopped.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3Np|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I know that we don't have 2 heart losers because North must have a heart honor in order to bid 3N. The question is do we have a diamond slam.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out we might. But I am not going to go on because of my void in clubs. North started with 2@C his club's fit very badly with my hand.|mb|P|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, 6@D is a reasonable contract. But because of the bad breaks in spades and diamonds it does go down. However I would like to be in it, looking at the North/South cards.|
