up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, should have made 5. Notice that East had problems discarding. An expert might have gotten it right, but maybe not. West should discard all of their spades so that East has a count of the spade suit and know to discard the @SK. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And then West should signal a high club so East can know to discard clubs. And that would legitimately hold them to 5. Notice that if North opened 3@H, that's where it would have been played.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct. 1@S only promises a 4-card suit. Even if partner has 3 spades with West's nice hand, 3NT is probably just as good as 4 spades.(although that turns out not to be the case on this hand).|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I wouldn't have disliked West just bidding 3NT. But 2@C was fine assuming partner understands what it means.|

PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One very important principle to keep in mind is "the magic of voids." My heart void is huge. When you have a void, you end up taking many more tricks than your HCP would indicate.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even if we weren't so lucky 5@C would at least be a good sacrifice, down 1 or 2 at most.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would count 4 club tricks and 4 diamond tricks just about for sure. Plus a spade ruff in North which comes to 9.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then if the club finesse works that's 10 tricks. And if the diamond finesse works and diamonds are either 2-2 or East has the singleton @DJ that makes another diamond trick for 11.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I might have a spade if the @SA is onside. Or I might get to pitch a spade (as declarer did) and ruff a spade for a 12th trick. |

PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, if you choose to lead the hearts suit, from KQx in NT, you need to lead the @HK. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And 2nd, on this auction North must have hearts so a heart lead is probably not going to work out (although it turns out ok here).|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now it turns out a spade lead is a possibility. In NT, even if declarer has bid a suit, if you have 4+ cards in that suit with 2 honors and no better lead, leading that suit can work out.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just keep that in mind, it is rare that you would lead declarer's known suit in NT. But this is one case where it is possible. So take back your heart lead. Either lead the @HK or pick another suit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Here I am missing the K and 10. Therefore, a low club is best. The only time the @CQ is right, if East specifically has Kxx of clubs and West has double 10x in clubs. And that is very unlikely.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, it is right to lead low if East has the singleton @CK or doubleton @CK of clubs (as it happens on this hand). Otherwise, it makes no difference which club to lead. So the low club is the correct play.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But here there are numerous reasons to not bid DONT despite my 5-4. We are vul and they are not. I am 5-4-2-2 instead of 5-4-3-1 (or even better 5-4-4-0 which is rare).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hands with singletons are much better on offense than those without. Further, I only have 5 HCP. And 4 of 5 points are in a short suit. You much prefer your points in your long suit or suits.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is why I think 3N is better than 2@C. West is 4-3-3-3 and West's hearts are as weak as they can be. So, despite having a 4-card major, 3NT is probably a better bid even with a 4-card major.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Either of these 2 factors should make you wary of bidding 2@C:
a) if you are 4-3-3-3;
b) if your 4-card major is weak.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has both of those factors. But it is going to work out anyway.|
