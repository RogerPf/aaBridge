nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You never need to ruff in the hand with long trump. Those trumps are good regardless of whether you ruff or play them out. Sometimes, particularly when dummy has 3 trump you need to delay drawing trump if dummy is short in a suit and you want to ruff. |

PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @CQ is dubious given the club overcall, other than the heart suit, the hand only has outside queens and jacks, and it is flat (no singletons or voids). Further, if North does not bid 2@H now, he may never get to bid it. Considering all those points, although I think 2@H is okay, it is definitely aggressive.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played. As to the bidding, although I am a very aggressive bidder I do follow some competitive guidelines. In particular, my rules for bidding "3 over 3" are you bid 3 over 3 if you have a 9-card fit or a singleton. Otherwise, "the 3 level belongs to the opponents."|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And notice on this hand how well it worked. E/W in 3@S are going to lose 2 clubs, a club ruff, a spade and a heart for down 1. Whereas they beat 3@H. So they would have been minus had they bid 3@S, which many pairs would have.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other very nice play was the 4th diamond by West, at trick seven even though West knew North was trumping. West was hoping that partner could overruff which was true on this hand.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West not led the 4th diamond then East would not have taken a trick with the @HQ. So the diamond was a very thoughtful play. And having seen his partner's queen earlier, with undo at trick two, didn't hurt. It was just a little peak.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|pc|ha|lb|*yIs that a good lead by West?^^n|up||nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*CLead for West by clicking that card on the right.^^h4^HAK94|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Heart is the correct lead but the ace is incorrect against NT. Leading the ace is usually done from a suit missing the queen such as AKJ10. It asks partner to unblock an honor if they have one and give count otherwise. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, the lead of the K (which admittedly is more often done from KQ rather than AK) in NT asks for attitude. So on this hand West has 2 choices as to what to lead. Either 4th best (@H4) which is often right with a 4-card suit or the heart king.|pc|H4|
