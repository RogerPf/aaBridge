mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people like to open light in 3rd seat but I prefer not to. The problem I have with opening light in 3rd seat is partner never knows whether or not you have a real opener and therefore cannot judge accordingly. On tthe other hand, I love to preempt in 3rd seat even with a slightly off shape or stronger or weaker hand.|

So a double by you here shows 3 hearts. A 2@H bid shows 4 hearts. If you did not play support doubles 2@H is a very good bid but playing support doubles is better. A support double can only be made by opener when responder bids a major.|

My competitive guidelines say it is okay to bid 3 over 2 even with an 8 card fit when you know the opponents have an 8 card fit. However, it is not okay to bid 3 over 3 unless you have a 9 card fit or a singleton. There is a support redouble had I bid double.|

If, for example, the @DA had been say the @CK instead then 5@H makes. The problem was that the @DA was not useful on offense but South has no way of knowing that. Regardless, the biddding was fine.|

mb|3Dp?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the 3@D bid by North. Some may be afraid to open 3@D vul with "only" 4 HCP but North has an ideal preempt hand. It has a nice suit but no defensive tricks, a nice distribution with a singleton, and shortness in the majors.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I weren't 4-3-3-3 I would bid 4@D. And even being 4-3-3-3 I might bid 4@D. All partner needs is 7 diamonds to the K and we have 9 sure tricks @- 7 diamonds and 2 hearts and the opponents could easily be
making 4@S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, because we are vul and I am 4-3-3-3, I will pass reluctantly. Although 4@D would not be a bad call anyway. And as you can see, the opponents missed a spade fit which is BTW, it is hard to bid.

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West should give a suit preference signal. West knows East has a doubleton club so should play a high club ie: the @C6  to show preerence for spades. In this case a spade lead is obvious. But sometimes it is not.|
