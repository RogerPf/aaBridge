cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North only has to keep bidding if passing would possibly end the auction. Here North can pass because of the double. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I won't pass. Often pass is fine after an intervening bid, as it keeps the auction at a lower level.|mb|P|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|2N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an interesting call with 20 Starting Points. Marty Bergen would definitely approve. However, this is one area where he and I disagree.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I use the following rule when opening 1NT or 2NT with less than the prescribed number of HCP. If my Starting Points are one higher than the min to open NT then I consider opening it even with fewer actual HCP than I need. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if my Starting Points were 21 (1 higher than the min of 20) I might open 2NT. But here I would not. But let's let it stand and see how it works out. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW the reason East has 20 points is we add 1 for the 5 card suit and 1 for 4 aces/tens and no queens/jacks not to mention he has 4 1/2 quick tricks. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I use a method called "quick trick" points when evaluating hands. There are 8 possible quick tricks and 40 HCP. So on average a quick trick is worth around 5 points. To calculate my "quick trick points", I multiply my quick trick count by 5. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If that number is equal or exceeds my HCP, then my hand is better than its HCP indicate and I upgrade it. If it is significantly less than my HCP then I downgrade my hand. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the East hand, I have 4.5 quick tricks for 22.5 quick trick points. It is much higher than its 18 HCP. So it is very upgradeable.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For that bid, I prefer to have 4 with better distribution but 2@D is okay. The only alternative to 2@D is 2@S. It has the advantage of showing exactly 3-card support but it is a bit of an underbid.|

mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An interesting call. It meets rule of 20--10 HCP, -1 for Jx of spades, +1 for quality clubs. 10 adjusted HCP and 10 points for 2 longest suits = 20.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I might consider 3@C for tactical reason because of short majors in the hand. 3@C makes it harder for us to find our major suit fit. But 1@C is fine.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


MB|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have an interesting decision. But one comment first. Many people would think that I should show both my spades and hearts. I completely disagree.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a self sufficient heart suit meaning it will only lose 1 trick even opposite a singleton. Whereas my spades, although I have 5 of them, are weak. So as far as I am concerned, we are playing in hearts.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My only consideration is what the best tactic is. Should I bid 1@H or 4@H. After an opener, slam is unlikely. Therefore, I think I will bid 4@H. Jamming the opponents is often a good idea especially at favorable vul (we are not, they are).|
