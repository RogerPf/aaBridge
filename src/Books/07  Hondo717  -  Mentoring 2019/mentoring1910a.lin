nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I only have 9 HCP that means it is very likely that West has a lot of HCP at least 15 or so, often more. And I would love to preempt. Unfortunately, I cannot with my hand, so I have to give West free rein to bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West is too strong for 1NT. If West wanted to open 2NT I would not dislike that. Marty Bergen would in fact recommends adding 1 point for the quality heart suit. I prefer not to stretch unless my Bergen count is 2 higher than my HCP.  so I would open 1@D.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs West was right to take his 9 tricks. In MPs, since North discarded some hearts, the heart finesse is probably a reasonable play, although if it is wrong the contract is down. Since we usually play IMPs at these sesssions West did well to take his 9 tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In MPs, I would probably play West for the @CA to try for 12 tricks if either major suit breaks 3-3 or the @SJ is singleton or doubleton. But in IMPs not worth the risk.|

The ^*b Law of Total Tricks^*n means that if they let us play in 5@D we will almost always do better than letting them play in whatever contract they want to play in. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3 quick tricks are 2 quick tricks in clubs and one in hearts. Further, you could count the North hand as having 9 tricks. 6 clubs, 1 heart, and you could say the diamond suit is worth at least 2 tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It allows you to find 4 card majors and 5 card majors in openers hand. So North should bid 3@C and if I bid 3@H or 3@S, that promises a 5-card suit.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I bid 3@D that promises 1 or 2 4-card majors. Puppet Stayman is played by many good players. I think it is okay, but you can survive without playing it.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on this hand, if we missed our 5-3 heart fit, 3N is a perfectly good contract. However we are going to find our 5-3 heart fit so North can bid 4@H knowing I have 5.|

pc|CQ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the tricks, I have 4 hearts (if hearts are 3-2), 2 spade, 2 clubs, and 2 diamonds. That is ten tricks. Further, if the spade finesse works I have 11. Or if diamonds are 3-3, I can throw a losing spade on the last diamond and take an extra diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And that is how I am going to play. Draw 2 rounds of trump, take the diamond finesse and if that works, play 2 more rounds of diamonds hoping the @DK drops or diamonds are 3-3.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, actually I misplayed the hand. I should have taken the spade finesse and hoped spades were 3-3 and the diamond finesse worked and then I make 12 tricks. I will reload and play it correctly.|
