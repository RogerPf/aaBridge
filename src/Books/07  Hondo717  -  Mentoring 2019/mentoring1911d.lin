PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So double of 2@C would have been "stolen bid" meaning if North had doubled 2@C, that is Stayman and all other bids are the same as if no interference. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, 2@D was a transfer. However experts play something more complicated called |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*g:Lebensohl::Competitive Bidding, Lebensohl^*n
^*N|CP||FP||at|where 2 level bids are to play. In that case North would bid 2@H to play and 2@D, had North bid that would be to play. The 3 level bids are also natural and game forcing. |

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S by East is not an option. That promises 6 spades. East's only choices are 3@C or 2NT. Generally 3@C promises a nice club suit (5 cards or a really nice 4 card suit). |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2NT is sort of the "default" bid. When there is no other bid available. On this hand, East has to bid 2N, despite the singleton diamond because the club suit is not good enough to bid 3@C.|mb|2N|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West should bid 3@S. That is at least a mild slam try showing 3 spades and at least 15 points or so.|mb|3S|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


mb|p|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is game forcing and is actually pretty strong. The only question is, would East interested in slam. It's close.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 12 HCP, 1 length points, 1 for 4 card suit, and 2 for singleton. That's 16. However, the singleton is in partner's suit, that is a minus. Further, they only have an 8 card fit and the 4 card club suit is very weak. So 4@S is okay.|mb|4S|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East wanted to bid 4@H as showing a heart control (and denying a club control and diamond control) that would be okay too.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You may ask, with a singleton diamond, why is East denying a diamond control. It is because in partner's suit, you don't show shortness as a control. You show only high cards.|
