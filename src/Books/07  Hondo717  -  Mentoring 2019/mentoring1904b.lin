up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was okay. It's not a great slam as it depends on picking up the club suit plus hoping that South has at least one heart honor. The problem was that, although East had 7 HCP he had flat distribution.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hands with flat distribution are not nearly as good as they look. So although 3@H was the correct bid, East's hand is not as good as it might be with the same 7 HCP and more distribution. That is why the slam was not a great one. However, I have been in worse.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Chance of game is remote and you want to make it hard on 4th seat to compete. In 4th seat, a 2-level opener is actually not a weak 2. It shows around 10-14 points and a 6-card suit. With a weaker hand there is no point in preempting.|

mb|2N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N is fine. West has 19 HCP. It has 4 Quick Tricks--1/2 in spades 1 in hearts 1.5 in diamonds and 1 in clubs. So it is worth around its 19 points. I might choose to double and correct to NT. But I would have to correct to 3N unless partner bid hearts.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to play. However, West could have made an extra trick by managing entries slightly better. Holding the HQ10x, West should have played the @HQ then the @H10 after clearing diamonds. Then the @H9 in dummy would have been an entry to the good @DK.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2@S we take 2 diamonds 1 club and 1 heart for sure and we can set up club tricks since clubs are 3-3. So we lose 2 spades 1 heart and 1 club and make 3 or maybe 2. In Match points -200 is not a good result. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think E/W can do any better. Have to lose 2 hearts 1 spade, 2 diamonds, and 1 club. In IMPs its not that terrible since we are +140 in spades--probably a 2 or 3 IMPs loss. Plus some pairs would bid 3@S and might go down if they didn't play it carefully. |
