nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted 7 losers (an imperfect evaluation) is an indication of a minimum hand. For example, if we changed @CQ and @DK to the @CA and @DA, East still has 7 losers, but that is a much better hand.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think relying only on losing trick count is not a good way to evaluate your hand, even though it is easy.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But admittedly East lack controls (aces and kings). So 4@S is possible bid but a bit pessimistic.|

PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the @SQ, East bids makes the cheapest bid in a suit containing a king. On this hand that would be 6@D, which shows the @SQ and the @DK (and denying the @CK). |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East had the @SQ and no outside king, he bids 6@S. (Some partnerships play a 5NT response shows the @SQ and no outside king.)|mb|6D|

up|18|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main message here (other than the discussion about 1430 vs 0314) is that you use "slow arrival" to look for slam when playing 2/1 Game Force.|

PG| ***** 33 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most non-experts use 1430 responses to Roman Keycard - 5@C = 1 or 4 Keycards and 5@D = 0 or 3 Keycards. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, most experts play 0314 - 5@C = 0 or 3 and 5@D = 1 or 4. Why? Because it is more logical that the cheaper bid shows fewer Keycards. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, when clubs are trump, you must play 0314 (even if you normally play 1430) because you must be able to stop in 5@C with 0 Keycard. There is no particularly good theoretical reason for preferring 1430 to 0314 other than most non-experts play it that way.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C (over 1NT) or 3@C (over 2NT) always asks about majors regardless of whether partner opened 1@C or 1@D. And with no major opener responds 2@D (over 2@C) or 3@D (over 3@C) rather than 2NT or 3NT. Let us play it here.|mb|3C|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand also illustrates another interesting point. With 4 hearts and 3 spades should North show their hearts or spades. It depends on your agreement. There are 3 choices.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Show your 4-card major (as North did)--3@H. Show 3-card support or always bid hearts (which is not that popular). Personally I believe in "support with support" so I like to show 3-card support if possible.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But we can play North's version of showing 4 card major.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So anyway, what I did was come up with a plan to win 10 tricks and executed it. There were several alternatives to consider (such as setting up my diamonds). And it doesn't matter which one you choose. But you need to plan and choose one, not just randomly play tricks and hope you make the contract.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*N Would @S10 have been better lead?|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand it turns out the @S10 works better. But leading a singleton trump, especially when you know they are in an 8-card fit and partner has 4, often gives away a trick.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure what I would have led. A diamond seems reasonable on the auction and a spade, although singleton, might work out okay. I tend to not like to lead suits the opponents have bid. So I would avoid leading hearts and clubs.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes the best opening lead is not the obvious opening lead. Opening leads are very difficult and even experts often choose a bad opening lead. All you can do is rely on general principles (don't lead the opponents suit, lead partner's suit, etc.) as they will work out best more often than not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It certainly does not. Don't get confused with the auction 1@C or 1@D-1@H-1@S. In the auction 1@S shows 5 spades because you can double to show 4 spades. This is a completely different auction.|

Your hand takes many more tricks than the HCP indicate. Basically you are neutralizing all of their HCP in our suit|
