mb|3D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hard to say whether North should take a bid over 3@D. Probably pass is okay.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having 3 cards in the opponent's suit is the worst holding you can have, particularly missing the CA and CK. That is one reason I think pass is best, particularly since partner is a passed hand. 3@D might work out, but the risk is not worth the reward. But I will let the 3@D bid stand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My @SQ sets up because if East ruffs high it is good and if East ruffs low or discards I overruff. We also get a heart trick. So 4@S is down 1. But 5@C is a better score.|
