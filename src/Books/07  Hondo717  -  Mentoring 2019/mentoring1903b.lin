mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On average after 2 passes, there will be around 16 points between the two passers. That means there are around 24 points between 3rd and 4th seat. Therefore, the weaker your hand is in 3rd seat, the more likely that 4th seat has a stronger hand.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I have 10 HCP. That means West is likely to have 14 or thereabouts. This rule (16 vs. 24) is a good guideline for opening in third seat after two passes. The question is what should I open with 10 HCP?|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, as you will see shortly, West is slightly weaker only having 12. I could open 1@S as a light opener in 3rd seat. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you should prefer to preempt in 3rd seat when appropriate. Sometimes even with a min opening hand and game is not likely as partner already passed  you want to make it as difficult as possible for the opponents.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could make a case for either 2@S or 3@S. However, I like 3@S better to get my length across.|MB|3S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Between you and South there are approximately 24 HCP, plus or minus a few. Since you have 12 I rate to have around 12 maybe a smidge less. Therefore, you want to pass. The chances of your having game are just about nil especially since partner passed.|

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the auction partner probably only has 1 heart. So we only have 1 heart loser. If partner has as little as Axxx of clubs we have no club losers. If partner has something in spades, like the A or Q we could easily be making 5@C. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Matchpoints I probably pass 4@C. But in IMPs, particularly if playing teams against a strong team, I might bid 5@C. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Notice that I did not count my HCP. I did what I call "picture bidding." I tried to imagine reasonable hands for partner based on the auction to see if 5@C made sense. It might be a little pushy.|mb|5C|

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another possibility is to try and ruff 2 hearts and then hope the @SA is onside. But I think it is easier to try for the 4-3 diamond break which is a bit over 50%.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand illustrated several important points:

With highly distributional hands, try to picture what partner needs for you to make game or slam rather than counting HCP. HCP are a rather inaccurate way of evaluating a distributional hand.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also keep in mind "the magic of voids." Hands with voids take many more tricks than you might otherwise think. Basically they neutralize all of the defensive high cards in the void suit.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The second principle was planning the hand by counting winners. I came up with a plan before playing to trick 3. If trumps had not broken 2-2 I had to hope the @SA was onside which was way more than 50% because East opened the bidding.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I didn't need the 2-2 break if the @SA was in the East hand.|

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At favorable vul, if you think they are making 5C you should bid 5@H. But there is some chance that 5@C is going down. North has 2 likely spade tricks although it is possible that one opponent is short. Then the question is, is there another trick. That is unclear.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming we have an 11-card fit (which we normally would when I open 3@H), unless hearts are 1-1, we don't have a heart trick. So unless we have a diamond trick 5@C is making. That is why I think in this case, 5@H is a reasonable decision.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in general, as a Kib said, the saying that "the 5 level belongs to the opponents" is a good one. That means when in doubt do not bid "5 over 5." |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And this hand is an illustration of that principle. As it turns out, although I think on this hand North's bid of 5@H was reasonable, there is only 1 diamond loser not 2. So 5@C is down 1 because if you play the @DA and @DK, and lead towards the DJ, you only lose the @DQ.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Luckily I only lost 4 heart tricks. But do I have 9 winners?|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 5 clubs 2 diamonds and 1 spade for sure. My most likely way to take a 9th trick is to try the spade finesse. It is also barely possible the @DQ10 are doubleton in which case the @D9 will set up. But that is very low percentage.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| The hand is likely to come down to the spade finesse. But I am going to cash my other winners first and throw a spade from dummy in case I get the very unlikely diamond break. The other possibility is the singleton @DQ, also unlikely.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should lead a club and not give anything away. By looking at your hand and dummy, partner can't possibly have anything useful in diamonds. 

This is a good illustration of where you should and where you should NOT be aggressive. People often mis-defend allowing you to make un-makable contracts.|
