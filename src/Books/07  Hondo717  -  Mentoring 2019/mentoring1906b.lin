mb|P|mb|P|mb|1H|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a very reasonable bid. Whenever you have the possibility of opening or overcalling 1NT you almost always should do it. On this particular hand, because of the nice 5-card spade suit I would not criticize a 1@S call either. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in general if you always call 1NT when it is an option you will be right more often than not.|

mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming double is penalty, I suggest you play what is known as |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?ndf=don.t_run_outs,DONT runouts^*n|CP||AT| as responder to the 1NT bidder.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 1NT bidder bids 2@C and I pass or correct to my suit. Unlike a DONT overcall, a DONT runout redouble only requires a 5-card suit because the NT bidder is known to have at least a doubleton in every suit and responder is looking for a place to play. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is similar in concept as to why you always transfer with a weak hand and a 5-card major, because you would rather play in the possible 5-2 fit rather than 1NT. If I bid a suit, that shows 2 suits: The bid suit and a higher ranking suit. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if I bid 2@C, that would show a 2-suited hand with clubs and another suit. 2@D would show diamonds and a major. You can do that even with 4-4 since the 1NT bidder presumably has at most 1 doubleton you are guaranteed to end up in no worse than a 4-3 fit. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand since I have a nice 5-card club suit I am simply going to redouble even though I have 4 diamonds,|mb|R|at| there are very few hands where 2@C is a worse contract than 2@D. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I am showing a 1 suited hand partner must bid 2@C. If I had both majors I bid 2@H to show hearts and spades. Here we are simply trying to escape to our best 2-level partial.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|+200 is a reasonably good result. But West should have figured out that East might be out of diamonds and after winning the @DK should play a 3rd round of diamonds to give partner a ruff and then EW would be +500 which would be a great result.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that the bidding was fine on all sides. Again, it is important that you count out the side suits. Counting is a crucial skill, particularly on defense. 

You must get in the habit of counting out suits. Since you can see 2 hands (yours and dummy) and declarer has bid you can almost always have a reasonably good idea of how a particular suit is distributed if you make the effort.|

UP|33|at|^^^^I might have gotten spades wrong here but West guessed correctly. 

I think in general the higher percentage play is to play South for the @SJ. But on this hand playing the @SK worked better because of the specific spade distribution on this hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, many players would have risen with the @SA with my hand making it easy for declarer to make the hand. However, "2nd hand low" is usually right, and you should get in the habit of playing 2nd hand low smoothly.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 18 HCP, a flat hand, and balanced distribution. It is usually right to overcall NT with a suitable hand. It is a very descriptive bid and gets your HCP across. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand North should bid 2NT which shows a good 15-18 and a spade stopper. What would have happened if North doubled. I would have bid 3@H.

PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So by bidding 2NT, North at least lets South decide whether or not to bid game and gets the point count across. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should pass. Partner (Notrump bidder) accepted to play 2@S doubled and given your spade holding in particular you should be happy to do so. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One reason, especially in Matchpoints, that the double is reasonable is because West has trump length and shortness in partner's suit. Both of which are great on defense.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite the bad break and singleton diamond it would have been very easy for the defense to go wrong and for me to make the hand. Defending partials is very difficult which is why you should be very cautious about doubling them.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although on this hand, there was definite merit to West's double with the shortness in partner's suit and trump length.|
