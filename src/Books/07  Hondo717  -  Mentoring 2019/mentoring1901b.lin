up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss about what West should bid over Michaels. Many experienced players play something called "unusual over unusual" which is a convention designed to handle 2 suited overcalls by the opponents (e.g. unusual 2N and Michaels in a minor suit). That is when the 2 suits are known.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that with a Michaels bid in the major, the minor suit is unknown so you can't play unusual over unusual. Unusual over unusual is a somewhat complicated convention so I am not necessarily recommending you play it.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you do, then it has the following features:

a) Bids in your own suits (e.g. either a raise of partner or the suit not held by the overcaller, clubs on this hand) are natural and non-forcing;

b) Cue bids (e.g. 2@H or 2@S) show either a limit raise of partner or a strong hand in the other suit (e.g. clubs).|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So a 2@H cue bid (since I have hearts) would show a strong hand in clubs (whereas a 3@C bid would just be competing in clubs). The reason it shows clubs is because the lower cue bid shows the lower suit (clubs is lower than diamonds).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 2@S cue bid shows a limit raise or better in diamonds (the higher cue bid shows the higher suit).|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And double says you are willing to play at least one of the opponents suits in a doubled contract. So if playing that bid, West might double (since he is willing to double spades).|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But let us assume you don't play that. Then what should West do? It is not clear. If I chose to bid, I would bid 2N. I certainly wouldn't bid 2@S natural since West knows South has at least 5 spades.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should play that bid of a suit the opponent is known to have, a cue bid, is either stopper showing or a cue bid showing a limit raise. Either agreement is fine. So West should either pass or bid 2N.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And as to the North. I think the law of total tricks should apply and I would bid 3@H with the North's hand. I think we make 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, I have no argument with 3@D. In fact, 3@D is a better bid than 3@C. You should prefer playing in your 6-card suit to your 4 card suit particularly when you know things are breaking badly.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss the play. The problem East ran into was she shortened her trumps by ruffing spades. What she should do is win the first trick and start diamonds. Then she will take 4 diamonds, 1 heart, 1 spade, and 3 clubs at least for 9 tricks. As always declarer should plan the hand at trick 1 and count their winners. |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played by ^*BWest.^*n Another interesting hand. Actually, 6@C is a really nice contract but hard to bid. West has a really nice hand with 15 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point for 18 Starting Point. And West has a "self fit" in spades, meaning his spades play fine opposite a singleton.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction started fine. As to what should East rebid, personally I would rebid 2@C, instead of 1N, because the clubs are pretty good. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Clubs are not great but good enough. But the one time it is okay to rebid 1NT with a singleton is when you open 1 of a minor, partner responds 1@S, and you have a singleton spade.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, West should think East has 2 spades. Personally, over 1NT, unless I have a way to bid key card with a void, I would just bid 6@S. West's hand has 18 Starting Points, and then can add 4 points for the void and 1 point for the 4 card side diamond suit. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had clubs broken 3-2, East has 6 spades 5 clubs and the @DA for 12 tricks. Although it happens to go down here, it is a pretty good contract.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner missed my signal at trick six. Plus, based on the bidding North can figure out West has no more clubs. Therefore, after winning the seventh trick, North should first play the @DQ and then play the @CQ. That way West does not get a ruff and sluff by playing the @CQ first.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed why it is not clear that West should bid 5@D. Next let me address the 2@H bid by East. I think it is okay although a little frisky. On plus side, East has 10 points(8 HCP, 1 length point, and 1 quality suit point) and the diamond fit helps. On the negative side, the the hearts are a bit weak.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@D is not clear. East likes her singleton club but they are vul and we are not. Moreover, it is not clear we can make 4@C. We lose 1 spade, 1 heart and 1 diamond for sure. On the other hand, 4@D should be down unless West guesses the diamond position.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading unprotected aces often gives away a trick. However, on this auction it is less likely to do so although it did here. You can make a case for any of 3 leads. Many experts believe you should lead a singleton unless you have a good reason not to and they would lead a heart. The heart lead could work out badly though, particularly since hearts were bid.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could also make a case to lead the @SK. I probably choose the @SK.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are in a slam auction. You either bid 4@D to see what West does or you bid 4@S to show 1st round control of spades and no heart control. Personally I like 4@S.|mb|4S|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bidding by everyone despite the vulnerability. I like the fact that West made the Law of Total Tricks bid of 4@S. It makes exactly 4@S after losing 3 aces.|
