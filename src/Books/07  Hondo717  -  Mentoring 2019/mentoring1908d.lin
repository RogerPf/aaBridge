nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I play Bergen Raises over a takeout double. So, 3@C and 3@D are also available to me as raises. Not playing Bergen Raises if I bid 2NT that would show a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But since I play that 3@C shows a limit raise, I play 2NT shows a 3-card limit raise. On this hand, they probably have a spade fit (partner has no more than 4 most likely). 

So I am bidding 4@H to make it hard for them to bid plus with my distribution I want to declare not defend.|mb|4H|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is called a "value showing" double. It is neither penalty nor takeout. It just says "partner this is our hand. do something appropriate." Note that the first takeout double showed heart shortness. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, this double could not be pure penalty. Partner will sometimes pass and sometimes bid a suit depending on what he has in his hand.|

up|40|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*NHow could we bid slam?|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only way for us to get to slam is for me to make my non-standard bid of 4@H as a control bid. And then you, with controls in both clubs and diamonds could bid RKCB. |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, you don't know about my club void you think we are missing 2 aces. So it's a hard slam to bid.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NAt what point would you make the 4@H bid?  And why is it nonstandard?|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear what a 4@H bid over 2@S should mean. I play that, after an invitational bid at the 2 level, any bids past 3 of our suit (3@S on this hand) are control bids. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But that is very non-standard. Playing my methods, I could bid 4@H to show a heart control and no diamond control or club control. 

Yes, a void is technically a club control, but you never bid shortness as a control in partner's suit; you only control bid aces and kings.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My making a 4@H control bid might get us to slam. If you have no agreement about 4@H, most experts would probably assume it was a splinter, showing heart shortness.|

mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear whether I should bid or pass. I don't particularly like my 5-3-3-2 distribution and only 11 HCP. But I do love my club suit and the @DA. That is a nice card. The @SQ is okay but not great. So pass is okay. But I like 3@C bid slightly better.|

PG| ***** 118 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if I reopen with a double (not likely because I have 2 Hearts-not vul though) then North can and should bid 4@S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not vul, that is much better than letting them make 4@H even when we are doubled. Personally, I would have bid 4@S over 4@H. But it is far from clear.|
