PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One good reason for me to preempt is because we are at favorable vul (we are not vul, the opponents are vul) that is by far the most advantageous time to preempt. However, I do have a flawed preempt.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My suit is nice but I do have some defense and the @DK is also some defense. In general, you prefer to preempt with little defense. That is one flaw.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other flaw is I have no singletons or voids and 7-2-2-2 is the worst distribution you can have with a 7-card. But despite those flaws you should preempt and I will. Many players look for excuses not to preempt. That is the wrong attitude.|mb|3C|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should look for reasons to preempt. Preempts are very good bids, very descriptive and very disruptive to the opponents. Their advantages far outweigh their disadvantages.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|SB|NWhat is a good bid for me?|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


sb|N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Use the law of total tricks. Bid 5@C. I have 7 clubs, you have 4. That's 11.|mb|5C|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should East do?. Well it is a problem. 5@C is likely to be going down with East having 3 aces. So Pass could be right, and so could double. However, a void is "magic" as Bergen says. What that means is when you have a void, your side usually takes a lot more tricks than the HCP indicate.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, particularly in Matchpoints, I might risk a 5@D bid. As I said pass could easily be correct. However, if I don't bid 5@D I think double is slightly better. Voids are rare so it is likely declarer is down at least 1. And if partner bids a suit, I do have support That is why we preempt to make it very difficult for the opponents to make the best decision.|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There two concerns here. First, North should lead the @CJ in case I don't have the 10. Second, declarer should ruff.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case, I am going to lead a diamond. It is not normally a good idea to lead a suit that the opponents bid and if I were sure that West had 4+ diamonds I might not lead them. But sometimes West might have to manufacture a jump shift. Therefore, there is a possibility that West only has a 3 card suit.|pc|D5|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a difficult hand to play but here is the best plan.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If spades are 3-3, East can count 5 spades and 3 diamonds for 8 tricks. Then he can hope for either a club trick (likely) or a heart trick.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East should with the first diamond, play 3 rounds of spades. Unfortunately they dont break but East should still play another spade. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North will win and play a club. East should play the @CK and I will play the @CA and lead a diamond. North can then take the remaing spade and diamond for 7 tricks (4 spades and 3 diamonds) and lead a heart and put up the @H10. That works as I win the @HA. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But unfortunately I cash a couple of diamonds and we win 2 hearts. So we win 1 club, 2 hearts and 2 diamonds and a spade for down 2. That is the best shot.|
