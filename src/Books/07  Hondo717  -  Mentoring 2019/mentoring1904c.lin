mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am going to bid 5@C as queen ask. The reason being, you should not bid slam missing 1 key card and the trump queen. Since we only have 4 key cards I want to stop in 5@H if North does not have the @HQ.|mb|5C|an|queen ask|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North's responses to 5@C are as follows:

If North does not have the @HQ, the bid is 5@H which is the response on this hand. If North does have the @HQ, the response is the cheapest suit with a king or 5N (or 6@H depending on your agreement) with the @HQ and no side kings.|mb|5H|

mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@C is fine. But I have 2 things to discuss regarding the 1@C opener. Many play with 4-4 in the minors they always open 1@D. That is reasonable. However Marty Bergen feels you should open your better minor (and I agree). So 1@C is the bid if you play Bergen's treatment.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other issue is East has 21 points and that is difficult to show after opening 1@C. So I would open 2NT but again that is a matter of style. Yes, I will open 2N with a singleton ace or king or I open 2@C followed by 2N. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nCan you open 2N with a singleton King as @HK here?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |

PG| ***** 33 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is actually a weaker bid than 3@S because 2@S establishes a game force and 4@S is an example of "fast arrival." If West had interest in slam, she should bid 3@S to give their side room to explore for slam. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I think West is slightly too weak to bid 3@S. It's close but East can't have much more than 20 and West has 11 dummy points which is not enough to be in slam. Therefore, I think 4@S is fine.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of minor points on defense and the hand in general. I would have led a heart at trick 2 before the defense gets a good count on declarer's hand. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because this is a rare case where North can figure out that 2nd hand high is fine when a heart is led late in the hand--trick 11.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Experts count out declarer's distribution. East opened 1@C and showed 4 spades and I showed a doubleton diamond. If I have a doubleton diamond then East has 4 diamonds. 

So East, having opened 1@C, has at least 4 clubs, 4 diamonds, and 4 spades. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East has 12 cards in spades, diamonds and clubs, then East has at most 1 heart. Therefore, at trick 11, the @HA is the correct play and not the second hand low.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, most players would play low at trick 11. So I wouldn't worry too much as 2nd hand low is right 99% of the time. I am just pointing out that by counting you can improve your defense. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Defense is by far the hardest part of the game. Even experts mis-defend a lot. Finally, North should have protected his @DJ at trick 10. |

PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know many people say you should not open a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major. I completely disagree.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is almost always right with a weak hand to play in your long suit. So even if we have a 4-4 heart fit, spades are likely to play better and preempting especially at favorable vul (we are not, they are) has huge advantages.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, some say I need a better suit. I also disagree with that. A 6-card suit is by definition a good suit and partner has on average 2. Therefore, if partner has an honor, we have at most 2 losers in the suit.|mb|2S|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


sk||nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHoward, the porcupines on our editorial board, in spite of your eloquent argument, did not like your 2@S. Moreover, they opine NS could bid 4@H and make. I cannot trust them porcupines. Please help.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


at|^z@3^b@2^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I actually have advocated to be more careful about preempting in 2nd seat. In 3rd seat you should strain to preempt, and even preempt with some minimum opening hands to make it harder for 4th seat to bid. In 1st seat, you should be aggressive, especially when not vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I believe you can preempt with an outside 4-card major, South has a clear 2@S opening bid. South has wonderful 6-4 distribution and little defense. It is an ideal preempt. Yes, it turns out that NS have a 9-card heart fit. But first of all that is unlikely. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is much more likely NS would have a spade fit than a heart fit. On average, partner will hold 2-3 spades when you hold a 6-card suit for an 8 or 9-card fit (7/3 = 2.33). On the other hand, on average partner will hold 3 hearts (9/3) when holding a 4-card suit, for a 7-card fit.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on this hand, if South passes, EW can make 4@C. East will open 1@C. North has several choices (1@D, 1@H, or 2NT). My choice is 2NT. That may get NS to 4@H if South is an aggressive bidder. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with only 4 HCP some Souths would not bid 4@H). Over 4@H, EW will bid 5@C and they are only down 1. So the actual result of +140 worked out fine for NS and is probably better than what would have occurred if South did not preempt.|

PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, my preempt gave West a problem which is the whole idea as to why you preempt. West has a 6 losers hand (2 in all suits but spades) and could bid 3@C. But that might work out badly as the hand could easily be a misfit and the club suit is not great for a 3 level overcall. However, its hard to know for sure.|

PG| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other reason is |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenhandevaluation,Bergen Hand Evaluation^*N|CP||FP||at|. West has 12 HCP, 1 length point, 2 points for the singleton, and 1 point for the side 4-card diamond suit for 16 points. That is enough to bid 4@S facing a limit raise bid. But remember the singleton principle. It works quite nicely.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best play is to draw the last trump and set up diamonds. The diamond suit is a little tricky. West needs to unblock and retain the @D4 so East can overtake. After drawing the last trump West should lead the @D7 (or 8) to unblock intending to play the @DJ if no honor appears from North and playing the @DA if North plays a diamond.|

mb|2S|MB|3D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D is a very reasonable bid. However, let me teach you an expert treatment, just so you know about it. With 7 very likely diamond tricks it is very likely that 3NT will make if West had a spade stopper. So the expert bid 
is 3@S.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most players play that as |CP|1|FP|2|AT| ^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=michaels,Michaels^*N |CP||FP||at| showing hearts and a minor. But experts play that as showing a running minor and lacking a spade stopper asking partner to bid 3NT with a spade stopper.|

PG| ***** 114 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Experts play what is called "Leaping Michaels." A 4@C bid by East shows clubs and hearts and a 4@D bid by East shows diamonds and hearts. In this fashion, experts can both bid Michaels and get to 3NT with a long running minor. So I undo the 3@D.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you have a regular partner who has a good memory you might want to switch to the expert treatment of a cue bid of 3@H over 2@H or 3@S over 2@S asks partner to bid 3N with a stopper. Over a weak 2@D however, 3@D is still Michaels.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|1S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 1@S is fine as an overcall. But West should also consider overcalling 1NT. Any time you have a possible 1NT opener or overcall you should usually make it. It is a very descriptive bid, much less ambiguous than 1@S although on this hand it probably doesn't matter.|

mb|1N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should bid 1NT. That shows 7-10 or so and a spade stopper.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT can be defeated but it is difficult. West should play the @SJ at trick 1 and that limits North to 1 spade trick.Moreover, if West figures out to save a club instead of a diamond(not obvious) then EW get 2 club tricks.|
