On the other hand, I love to preempt in 3rd seat and am very aggressive about doing so. But I feel that opening light in 3rd seat at the 1 level makes it hard for partner to judge how high to bid.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I should not have made 4@S. It is not a great contract. But sometimes it is hard to defend correctly as this hand illustrates. Having said that, here is how West should have planned the defense.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick 4 after winning the @SJ, West should play a diamond, not the @CQ. West can count 3 tricks for sure--1 club and 2 spades. If partner has the @DA, @DK, or @HA I am down. And playing a low diamond, @D3, caters to all of those possibilities.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lead low in the middle of the hand to show an honor. Lead a high spot with no honor. The point is West needs to adopt an aggressive defense. Dummy's clubs look ominous once West leads the @CK. So West must set up their side's tricks before I set up my tricks.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Often the defense is a race and one advantage the defenders have is they get to strike the opening blow with their opening lead. But even on this hand, West needs to try and win the race by leading a diamond: before I set up my clubs.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BA Kib^*n: Can you discuss when it's better to raise with 3 card support vs when it's better to bid 1NT then later bid 2@s?  e.g., point counts for constructive raises, etc.?|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play "constructive" or "semi-constructive" raises. That means that they won't raise to 2@S with 3-card support and 6 or a bad 7. If they bid 2@S, in this board, it shows 8-9 or at least a good 7. That assumes they play forcing 1NT.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with 6-7 points and 3-card support they bid 1NT and correct to 2@S. I am not a big fan of constructive raises. I have 2 objections:
|lg|g|n#|5|at|^c@21) you now don't know when partner has 3-card support;
2) an immediate 2@S raise is more preemptive than bidding 1NT first.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I personally recommend not playing constructive raises although some experienced players like them.|

mb|2H|an|DONT 5-4 (4-5) !h+!s|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is DONT, showing hearts and spades. But even though I love DONT and I love "favorable vulnerability" (we are and they are not) I think East is too weak to bid DONT. However, it works very well here so I am leaving it.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out we make 3N because of the lucky diamond and spade distributions. So that worked out well for E/W. It shows that aggressive bidding usually pays off. Well done by everyone.|

mb|D|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should double to show some values and willingness to defend saying nothing about hearts.|

mb|P|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given the double and the vulnerability, East wants to play in game. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East bids 2@S that shows a spade stopper rather than asking about a spade stopper because there are 2 suits East is worried about-spades and whatever my other minor is. So 3@C denies a spade stopper but shows strong interest in game.|mb|3C|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am going to lead a diamond. The standard lead from @Q109 is the 10. But I prefer coded 10s and 9s where from A109 K109 and Q109 you lead the 9.|pc|D9|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BA Kib ^*n:What would you lead from @DQT9632 if you were not playing coded 10s and 9s? And what about fourth best we hear all the time?|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't lead 4th best when you have an honor sequence. You lead the top of the sequence (such as K from KQJ or KQ10, Q from QJ10 or QJ9, or J from J109 or J108). Also, if playing standard leads you lead top of the interior sequence (J from AJ10 or KJ10, 10 from A109 or K109 or Q109). |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if playing coded 10s and 9s, you lead a card from the interior sequence, just the 2nd highest instead of the highest. BTW, the reason to play coded is so that when partner leads the J or 10, you can often tell whether partner is leading top of a sequence (e.g. has nothing higher) or top of an interior sequence (e.g. has a higher honor).|
