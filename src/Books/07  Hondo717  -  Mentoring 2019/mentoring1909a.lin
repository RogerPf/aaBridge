mb|1D|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days, those who play 2/1 play that 2@C by me is game forcing. That approach has plusses and minuses. If you have an 11ish point hand with lots of clubs you may have no good bid. On the other hand, establishing a game force when you can is a good thing. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On balance I agree with playing 2@C as game forcing but if you want to play it as not game forcing I think that is fine. Further, the auctions that start 1@D/2@C really need discussion by good partnerships.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Matchpoints North took a reasonable line. It was 75% that East held at least one diamond honor. But in IMPs there was a better line to guarantee 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North can count 5 clubs 2 hearts and 1 diamond for sure. Therefore, leading a spade to knock out the @SA is much better in IMPs. It guarantees 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing diamonds, although very likely to succeed, is not 100%. But it can easily lead to 10 tricks if it works. So in Matchpoints it is probably the better line.|

up|28|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are lots to discuss. First the bidding.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should bid 3@C on the first round and not 2@C. Then we might actually get to play it there. And over 3@S it is not clear whether or not to bid 4@C, although I think I would.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason is, when you bid 4@C in a competitive auction and the opponents's suit is a major you have to be happy if you force them to bid 4@S. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think given the strength of North's hand and my takeout double North could expect we are setting 4@S. Particularly since I showed spades with my original double. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But before bidding 4 of a minor you have to consider whether or not you will be happy if the opponents then bid game over your bid. And therefore, tend not to bid it if you are not happy.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, both West and North forgot about the auction.|hb|c|wb|r|ip|60|bm|https://media1.tenor.com/images/35ea53bbff3fc813f48cd979f71e6efe/tenor.gif?itemid=5261739|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me start with West. Once the @SA wins, based on the auction West knows that East started with Kxx of spades and North was out. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means it is possible to set up the @SQ with 2 ruffs. So West should lead a diamond and set up their side's tricks first.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly, North knows that East started with Kxx of spades. West played the @SA on the first trick. So East must have the king.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North can also figure out the the @SK is coming down and can therefore throw his heart loser on the @SQ. So that is how the hand should be played.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, West has 19 Declarer points. With that hand I would make a game try. To make a game try West has to bid a new suit. But it ends up the same on this hand since West bids 3@D and East bids 3@S having a very weak 2@S bid.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's possible also. But partner is close to broke and playing 23 opposite 2 is hard. Admittedly the points are all behind you.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West overcalled 1NT (on a different hand) that would show 15-18. Had West doubled and then bid 1NT over 1@S that is a "double and correct" and shows 19-21.Therefore 2NT shows 22-24 or so. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, if West wanted to just go ahead and bid 3N over 1@D or even bidding 3N over 1@S, I wouldn't dislike that.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way West played the hand was okay, except I suggest the following:
I opened, I show about 13 points and he has 23. That's 36 between our 2 hands. Therefore, my partner has no more than 4 or 5 points.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, at trick 6, a better play is the @HK when a heart is led off dummy. Since if North has the @HA those are her only points. And it is more likely North has some stray jacks and queens than specifically the @HA and nothing else.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But since I had a doubleton heart it turned out not to matter.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So that worked out nicely. Notice that I knew West had nothing based on the auction. Thereore, I knew both the diamond finesse and spade finesse were working and played it accordingly.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Planning on either ruffing 2 diamonds if the @DK didn't drop or taking the spade finesse if the @DK did drop.|
