nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out because North has 4 hearts to the @HJ9 and I have the @H10 we do have a heart stopper and could make 3NT as you can see. But there is no way for me to know that. So I had to assume we don't have a heart stopper and bid 4@C.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, in this particular case, since I hold the @CA and @CQ I know partner has diamonds. But sometimes I don't know that.|

sk||up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It always makes 4@D, losing 3 hearts. If North opened 1@D I would respond 1@S. Over 1@S North might bid 3@D and I might chance 3NT hoping we had a heart stopper.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I think East would either double or overcall 1@S over 1@D. Then I would bid 2@C. If East bid 1@S West would raise to 2@S and it would be hard to get to 3N since even if North bid 3@D, I would not try for 3N.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So not sure even not playing gambling 3N we get there. As is often the case, preempts make it harder for the opponents to come in whereas opening at the 1-level makes it easier.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nWhy not play diamonds (trumps) untill 1 left then heart to try for overtrick.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is correct. However, it would not work with an expert because West should throw away all of his hearts allowing East to count the suit.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, when East is in with the @HK he should not play a club. He should play either the @SK or the @HA to make sure he knows which suit North has left and not have the discarding problem in the first place. Also, on the spade lead at trick 2, an expert West would play the @SQ under the @SA. That discard shows an honor sequence of QJ (and usually the 10).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think every player should learn it once they get the basics of bidding down. In fact there is a case to be made that it should be taught to beginners even.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Difficult hand to play. Declarer made a slight planning error. If declarer was setting up diamonds he should have won the @CA at trick 1 so there were 2 club entries to the North hand. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It probably won't make any difference. But it might. Let's do some planning. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first thing to do is count winners. Declarer has 1 spade, 2 hearts, and 3 clubs for sure fo 6 sure tricks. So, he needs 3 more winners. Personally, I would work on spades, hopeing for 2 more spade tricks if spades break 3-3 or the @S10 is with East.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That takes me to 8 and then I hope for a diamond trick. So I would win the Club in my hand and play the @SA and another spade. Presumably, after East wins the spade they play another club. I win in dummy and play another spade. That sets up 2 spade winners and then I have to guess the diamonds.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, when I have the KJ and I have no idea which defender has which missing honor I lead low to the jack. It is a pure guess. I could also play for 3-3 hearts. But that's a 40% chance whereas playing West for the @DQ is 50%.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, the point is you need to plan the hand out at trick 1 by counting winners and coming up with a plan to take 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You shouldn't make it up as you go along. You need to decide at trick 1 how you are going to play the hand. It is often crucial which card you play at trick 1.|

So I can bid 5@C. Had North passed and East bid 4@S. I would have to pass and then North might decide to bid 5@C but harder to decide.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


mb|5Cp|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should double 5@C to show some values. It is not a pure penalty double at this level. Since West obviously can't have good clubs.

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North chose an interesting and effective line of play. I would have done it differently. I end up taking 3 heart tricks, 5 clubs, and a diamond ruff for 9 tricks. But North's line was just as good a way to take 9 tricks. Well done.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Slightly risky taking the club finesse, although the contract was already made. Well played. However, if it lost, we could end up taking the rest of the tricks in spades and diamonds.|
