nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only way to beat the hand is to find the very non obvious defense of underleading the @CA at trick 3 and taking 2 clubs and a club ruff. That is very difficult to find.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West's defense was okay. Although she might try a spade rather than another @d when in with the @CA.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@H is not a good contract and most would go down.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has no good lead. No matter what suit West leads, it could easily give away a trick. It turns out the best "double dummy" lead (e.g. the lead if you get to look at all 4 hands) is the @DA.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would probably lead a spade. Although that might not work out. A heart from Jxx is ok if partner has no heart honors. But if partner has a heart honor it will probably cost a trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The heart lead gave away 1 trick. But it was a reasonable lead. On a spade lead, it turns out I lose 2 clubs, 1 diamond, and 1 heart even though the spade lead gives away a trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, this is why you should bid aggressively. Both on this hand and the previous hand, although the hand can be beaten, the defense is very hard to find.|

PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Quality of heart suit is quite nice. The hand has at worst 2 losers. And if partner has the @HQ has one loser. With @HA, possibly 0 losers. Any 6-card suit with 3 honors is a really nice suit.|

pc|S9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss "coded 10s and 9s" as leads against NT. Some people also play coded tens and nines against suits, but I don't.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of the ten shows either no higher cards (e.g. 109) or 2 higher cards including the jack (e.g. AJ10). Or some people say 0 or 2 higher. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although that is technically correct, it is an incomplete descriiption because you normally do not lead the 10 from AQ10 (which does have 2 higher).|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 2 higher when you lead the 10, one of the higher ones tends to be the jack. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you play coded tens and the lead is the jack, that denies anything higher (because you would have led the 10 for AJ10 or KJ10, and the Q from QJ10).|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Coded 9 is similar. It shows 0 or 2 higher. So either 9xxx (often the 8) or A109, K109, or Q109. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We are playing coded nines here. Since I bid spades, partner knows I have the A109 or K109.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@H is a better contract assuming the hearts are played the same way. It will make if either you only lose 1 heart, or the diamond finesse works. Whereas 3N only makes if the hearts are played for one loser.|

mb|P|mb|1D|mb|P|mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West does not quite have a game force, so 1@S is the best bid. But with another point or so (give West the @SJ for example) the correct bid would have been 2@C.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is particularly important in 2/1 GF where you should strain to make a 2/1 GF when you can. But even if playing 2@C not game force, with 5 clubs and 4 spades and an opening hand,  2@C is the correct bid followed by a spade rebid later. 

That shows an opener with 4 spades even if not playing 2/1.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, I highly recommend everyone who comes to these lessons learn and play 2/1. It is vastly superior to SAYC.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East played the hand well. The line of play was fine, although I can sugggest some minor improvements.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After the lead, East should count the tricks. East can count 2 heart tricks, 1 spade, 4 diamonds and 1 club. That's 8 tricks. East needs one more trick. The best chance is in spades. And the way East played the spade suit is best.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It will work any time North has a doubleton honor or goes up with the @SK (which many players will do). 

Or has the @SJ, assuming East was going to play the @S10 if North played a low spade.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That works well since North has doubleton @SJ. Note the doubleton @SK is just as good.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if the spade play didn't work (e.g. I had KJ9x of spades) then a 2nd chance is for me to have the @CK. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the only suggestion I have is to save the @DA and if the spades don't work, after I cash my spades win the likely diamond return and lead a low club towards the @CQ.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, the spade play is likely to set up a 2nd trick most of the time.|

mb|1H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is certainly the normal bid. Having said that, there is a case for making a tactical 4@H call especially at this vul. Yes, it gives up chance for slam but 4@H is very likely to be the best spot for the hand and puts a lot of pressure on NS.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pretty clear pass by West. Now let us think about what is going on to help North with his bid. I bid 2@S showing 6 spades and a weakish hand. I probably have 2 or fewer hearts although I might have 3.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means they have a heart fit. This is a competitive auction, not a constructive auction which means your objective is to make it as hard for the opponents to bid as possible.|

up|29|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The point of this is I planned the hand out to give myself several chances. The best chance was guessing diamonds for one loser. But I gave myself other plays as well.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, 4@H by E/W is down 1. They lose 2 spades 1 diamond and 1 club. But if East opens 4@H and it goes P-P, I have to pass with my weakish flat hand with not great spades.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, North should pass if East opens 4@H. North could double and if I pass the double then we do fine.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with my hand I probably bid 4@S (although I do have 2 possible tricks and partner rates to have at least 2 for down 1).|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that after my 4@S bid North probably bids 5@C as in 4@H-P-P-D-P-4@S-P-5@C which is down at least 1. So my guess is over 4@H we end up in 5@C down 1 for same result.|
