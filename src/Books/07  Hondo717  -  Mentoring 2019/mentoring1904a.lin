pc|S9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since West preempted the spade lead looks auspiciously like a singleton. North's negative double means he has spades. Normally a defender would not lead one of declarer's long suits. A diamond lead would have been more likely.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 2 diamonds and 1 spade for sure. So I need 6 tricks more. There are likely 4 hearts on length (although maybe only 3). Therefore, I have to get 2 more tricks.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turned out North was right to pass. Turns out even 3@H can go down. When East overruffs with the club, if he then plays @HA and low heart I am one trick short. But that play is hard to see.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note the effectiveness of the 3@D bid. It made it much harder for us to bid. So be aggressive with your preempts. They work more often than not. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East might want to bid 4@D because if West has 7 diamonds, they have a 10-card diamond fit.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|EW are likely to come to 8 or 9 tricks and we might double. But if we don't, or they make 9 tricks it works out okay. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think pass is a bit better than 4@D with the East hand because although they might have a 10 card fit, if West has 7 diamonds, East's hand is flat with no singletons or voids with values in the majors. So East probably wants to defend rather than bid.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. I really don't like to let them play at the 2-level when they have a known 8-card fit particularly in Matchpoints, even though we are at unfavorable vulnerability.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have bid 3@C with the North hand but probably not in IMPs. However, in Matchpoints, at best 2@H will be an average minus. In 3 clubs we lose 1 club 1 diamond, 2 hearts, and 1 spade for down 1.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We are not going to be doubled. So in Matchpoints -100 is better than -110.
Plus some pairs might bid 3@H which goes down. In IMPs, -100 is no different than -110. 

However, there still is the possibility that they bid 3@H. I wouldn't because it does not meet my competitive guidelines for bidding 3 over 3.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|EW don't have a 9-card fit, nor a singleton in our suit. So they should not bid 3 over 3 but some pairs would anyway. Remember when you bid aggressively, even when it is theoretically the wrong bid when you look at the hands, the opponents often make a bad decision and overbid.|

mb|1D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I hope those of you who have been at my lessons know that my hand is worth much more than its 14 HCP. Using Bergen Hand Evaluation it is 14 HCP, + 3 length, and + 2 quality suits for 19 Starting Points to begin with.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, I can count 2 for each singleton and an extra point for the side 4+ card club suit making it worth around 24. The point is, if partner has the @DQ and an ace with only 6 HCP it makes 5@D. And 6 is very possible.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Is the hand worth a 2@C opener?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|                No, for 2 reasons. 
Although you could count 4 club tricks and 5 diamond tricks for 9 tricks it does not have 4 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at|. 
Plus it is 2 suited making it awkward to describe after opening 2@C.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, you should avoid opening marginal 2@C bids when your suit is a minor (especially diamonds) because the auction starts 2@C-2@D-3@D placing you at the 3-level before the first natural bid is made. You are essentially preempting yourself.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One way to do that is to double an artificial bid as was done here and the other way is to make an overcall when you have a nice suit you want led.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is, what is more likely. A 4-1 spade break or a diamond overruff by West. A diamond overruff means that diamonds are breaking 6-1 which is much less likely than 4-1. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But have a bigger possibility than usual because of the lead directing double. If spades break 3-2 I can ruff high. But if they don't I can't. |

Of course North could just bid 4@H.

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am showing around 19 points. So slam is very possible. Therefore, North should control bid. But, North can't control bid 3@S because 3@S would be a preference for spades as trump. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, North can control bid 4@C. That cannot be natural. I can't have clubs. Therefore, it is a control bid, accepting hearts as trump and showing a club control.|mb|4C|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nBy bidding 4@C could North promise 8 clubs?|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In theory North could have 8 clubs but you cant worry about that. Bidding has to take into account the likely distributions. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, there are hands where you want to play in 2 of a minor as responder rather than 1N. But no bidding system allows for that since 2@C is Stayman and 2@D is a transfer. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Same thing here. You can't worry about the unlikely hand where North has 8 clubs. You have to worry about the more likely times when slam is possible.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I am going to bid 4@S which is Key Card Ask when hearts are trumps.|mb|4S|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North will bid 5@C to show 1 Key Card. 5@C shows 1 or 4 when playing 0314. If playing 1430 then 4N would be the bid.|mb|5C|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, I wouldn't try for a grand slam. So I would just bid 6@H because I know we have 4 Key Cards and don't care whether or not we have the @HQ.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^
^*BMM: ^*nPlease note this is a teaching table and Howard can see all four hands. However, he plays as he would have if it was not a teaching table--as much as possible.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I am going to bid 5@D as |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=queenask,Queen Ask^*N|CP||FP||at| to illustrate how the queen ask works.|mb|5D|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North would respond 5@H without the @HQ.  But North has the @HQ and bids the cheapest king. Here the bid is 5@S which shows the @HQ and @SK.|mb|5S|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now it is barely possible North has the @DK also because that would give North the @CA @SK and @DK for 10 HCP. North could also have the @CK. In either case I can count 13 tricks--good for bidding 7.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, I can't find out about both. So I have to only find out about 1 and if I bid 6@C here that asks partner to bid 7 with the @CK. And if I bid 6@D here that asks partner to bid 7 with the @DK.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is if you want to get real fancy which most partnerships don't do. And I am not in the least recommending it. But let me do bid 6@C.|mb|6C|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should bid either 7@H with the @CK, bid 6@D with the @DK and not the @CK, or bid 6@H with neither the @DK nor @CK. In this case North bids 6@H, denying both kings.|mb|6H|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, further analysis would have given me the information without this bid. BTW, other than kickback and the Queen ask I am not saying you should play any of this fancy Key Card Ask stuff but I thought it was interesting to discuss.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In addition, I can take the diamond finesse if spades are not 3-3 and hearts are not 2-2. So I have a lot of chances to make 7. But you only want to be in 7 if you have about a 70-75% chance to make. |
