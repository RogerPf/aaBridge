cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Either is fine. Reverse gives you more room to explore when you have a limit raise hand, but not that important.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


mb|D?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the 3@D bid followed by the double by North, there are 2 additional bids available for East--pass and redouble. BTW, you should have agreements as to what they mean.|

PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given the double, you might add 1 point (17 total) for the diamond holding since the @DK is almost surely onside. Therefore, @DAQ is essentially equivalent to @DAK.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, the total East/West assets is 24-26 total points. West showed 7-9 points.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would call that an invitational hand. Absent the double, 3@H would be a general invitation. But with the double, you can now play the following:|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|^z@3^b@2^^|lg|f|at|^B@23@S is the weakest bid, to play;
Pass is mild invitation;
Redouble is stronger invitation, and;

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would redouble (strong invitation) since if partner has 8 I would be willing to be in 4 but pass would be okay also.|mb|R|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 4@S is a bit much, and 3@S is definitely too weak especially with the @HA and diamond singleton.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would bid 4@S. But it is a tad aggressive.|

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if you wanted to temporize you could bid 3@H. In short, I think either 3@H or 4@S is better than 3@S.|

PG| ***** 40 ***** |


mb|p?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nCan you comment on North's double.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North does have a tough decision. The spade void is wonderful. I don't dislike the double. But it also might suggest a diamond contract and might get me off to the wrong lead.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North's other choices were to bid 4@D over 3@D.However, given the vul, that is a bit of a stretch.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North can bid 4@D over 3@H, again a stretch. So I think North did the right thing although it turns out it gets me off to the wrong lead.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East can decide that 3@H improves his hand. It makes KQ of hearts worth 5 points and bid 4@S. That is what I would do.|

PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2Cash the @HK and HQ first to unblock. Then ruff a diamond and play the @HA discarding a losing club. If East plays a spade, that just about guarantees down 1 since I will shift to a club after winning the trick. You need to plan the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't hate 1NT but I personally bid 1@H. However, given the modern style, where I would often bid 1@H rather than 1@D, 1NT has merit.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a style of bidding called "Walsh" where 1@D either denies a 4-card major or shows a strong hand. But in general that is not true.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It does tend to deny a 4-card major but I could have, for example nice diamonds and a weak 4-card major and decide 1@D is better. Walsh is pretty complicated and I don't recommend playing it.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although East could have a 7 card suit it is more likely they have a 6 card suit meaning EW has an 8 card fit. So it is wrong, by the Law of Total Tricks, to bid to the 3 level with an 8 card fit.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, had West passed North should bid 3@D since North knows we have a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We can make 4@D, if we play carefully, probably because of the lucky club position. We can take 6 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart, and 1 spade for sure. And if North manages a spade ruff, that is the 10th trick.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have to be careful when analyzing hands to count winners not just losers. Because although we in theory have only a spade loser if North tries and ruffs 2 spade tricks one of the ruffs will be with a high diamond which would set up the @DJ. Thus creating a diamond loser.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, despite what many teach, you should count winners, not losers, even in suit contracts. It is a more accurate way of analyzing a hand. Often it comes out to the same thing. But sometimes, as on this hand it comes out differently.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes 7 sometimes 6. At this vul often 7 unless I am short in spades which given your hand and the auction is not likely. They probably don't have a 10-card spade fit.|

However, North's hand has some flaws. The @SK is worthless. Unless I have 3 spades we are likely to only be able to take 8 tricks at most.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other consideration against bid 4@D is because of what just happened. North does not really want them to bid 4@S. Had North passed, East might have passed as well.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, though it is close, I might have bid 4@S with the West hand to start with. West has 11 HCP, a quality suit for 12 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenstartingpoints,Bergen Starting Points^*N|CP||FP||at| and the diamond doubleton is a possible point along with nice @CQ109. So I would have bid 4@S but not been surprised if it went down.|

UP|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unintentionally, we pushed them into a non making 4@S. But keep the tactics in mind when you bid 4 of a minor in a competitive auction. 4 of a minor is a "sacrifice suggestion."|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should only bid it if you a) think they are likely to bid 4 of their major and b) you want to suggest to partner to sacrifice in 5.|

mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, despite the modern tendency to open 1NT with many non-flat 15-17 HCP hands I don't like to do that. I prefer to have 5-3-3-2 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 distribution. However, I sometimes make an exception with 4 hearts and a 5-card minor.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is because if I open 1 of a minor and partner makes the likely 1S response, unless I am willing to bid 2@H as a reverse I don't have a good rebid.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's hand is close to a reverse so I might open 1@C and rebid 2@H over 1@S. But if I decided it was too weak to reverse I would open it 1NT to avoid the rebid problem.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


MB|1S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think pass is reasonable with the West hand, But another alternative is to make a "Negative Double" and correct. In other words double and then bid 2@H over whatever East bids. That shows a weak hand with long hearts.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, particularly at this vul, and given the weak hearts I think pass is much better than double with the West's hand.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*nDo I need pts. for a negative dbl?|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A negative double of a 1@S overcall is basically equivalent to a bid of 1@H had there not been a 1@S overcall. So if you were going to bid 1@H with no overcall, you can make a negative double. Just think of the double as a "1@H" bid.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't hate pass by North. But I prefer bidding 2@S.|

PG| ***** 151 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Over 1@S, I would have bid 2@S with your hand. Pass was okay but not a good tactic.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see now you can bid 2@S.|

mb|2S|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I would have bid 3@H with the East hand. But it is very aggressive. Since West did not make a negative double they can't have too many points and pass is reasonable particularly at this vulnerability.|
