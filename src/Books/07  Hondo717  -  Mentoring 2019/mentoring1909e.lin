PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 16 HCP, 1 quality suit point, and 2 length points for 19. My choice is 3@D which is game forcing and a slam try.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWhy is 3@D forcing?|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because 2@D is to play. With an invitational hand there is no reason to bid 3@D. You bid 2N for an invitational.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


mb|3D|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should consider 3@D as a possible slam try. And although West only has a doubleton diamond, it is very likely East has 6 diamonds or at least 5 very good diamonds.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with 14 HCP and 2 aces and 2 kings, West should be very interested in slam and should control bid 3@H.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


mb|3H|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East is worried about club losers and 3@S is a good bid. Hopefully partner will bid 4@C|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is probably reasonabe for East to bid 6@D but might check for aces just in case West only has one. Most players here would bid 4NT. But experts play something called |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=kickback,Kickback RKCB^*N|CP||FP||at| where the suit above the trump suit is RKCB.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, 4@H here by East over 4@C is Kicback RKCB. Further, most experts play 0314 responses.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, since West has 2 aces it doesn't matter. So 4@S = 0 or 3, 4N = 1 or 4, and 5@C = 2 and no queen.|

mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if you normally play you cannot open a weak 2 with a 4-card major (which I think is a very wrong way to play), in 3rd seat you should throw that restriction out. In 3rd seat you should strain to preempt.|

mb|2D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a good Marty Bergen rule to use. He calls it the "Rule of 24." When there are 2 passes, on average, the first 2 players have around 16 HCP betweeen them. That means 3rd seat and 4th seat average around 24 HCP.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if 3rd seat subtracts their HCP total from 24 they have a reasonably good estimate of how many points 4th seat has. Which means, the less 3rd seat has the more 4th seat has. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Meaning you should strain to preempt even with weak hands. On this hand West has 9 HCP and the rule doesn't work so well since in theory North should have around 15 HCP but only has 11. Also, both East and south have max passes with 10 HCP each. In general the rule of 24 works pretty well.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would like to balance. But there are a lot of minuses to my hand. I am 4-3-3-3 and holding 3 cards in the opponents suit, especially when it has not been raised. |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is very bad. On the other hand we are not vul. If the @DQ was in a different suit, I would definitely make a takeout double. Here it is not so clear. In MPs I probably double. But in IMPs it is not worth it.|

|cp|8|at|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I (South) make a takeout double partner bids 3@C. And presumably we get a diamond lead. Then we lose 2 hearts, 1 spade, 1 diamond, and 1 diamond ruff for down 1. So in IMPs we break even basically. In MPs we might be slightly below average.|

^-{You may now play this hand double dummy by clicking the cards you want to play. 
@H6 was the original lead. You can use different opening lead.
When finished or if not interested in double dummy play, click the "Next Page" to move to the next section.}
