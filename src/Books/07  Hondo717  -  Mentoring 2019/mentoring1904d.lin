up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although slam is a great contract, it is very hard to bid. And once I bid 3@H it is not that easy to get to 5@C. 

West has a very nice hand but has no way of showing all its values.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at the East hand and count |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Bergen Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at|.

PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 40 HCP and 8 potential Quick Tricks. So each Quick Trick is "worth" about 5 HCP (40 / 8). A hand which has the same or more Quick Trick points than actual HCP is better than it looks.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets look at West's hand. All partner needs is an ace and he can make slam. West knows he has no spade losers, partner promises 4 spades, because with a 10 card fit even if partner does not have the @SQ it will drop in 2 rounds.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So no spade losers, no heart losers, 1 club loser, and 1 diamond loser. If partner has either the @CA or @DA 6 is making.

up|20|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So this hand illustrates that when you have a very distributional hand rather than counting points "picture" what hand partner needs to have.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting question. In order to open |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=open2c,2C^*N|cp||fp||at| you need 4 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| and 9 tricks in your hand. That is not "4 losers" per se but 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West does have 4 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at|. But you don't know how many tricks is the hand worth for sure. What you do with long suits is assign an "average" number of cards to partner. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In spades, West has 6 spades meaning the other 3 hands have 7 spades-7 / 3 = 2.33. So on average partner will have 2 spades sometimes 3. With 2 spades, and a 3-2 break West will take 5 spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In clubs, there are 8 out, on average partner will have 8 / 3 = 2.67 clubs or 3 a lot of the time and sometimes 2. With 3 clubs West will take 4 club tricks. With 2 clubs in partner's hand, assuming the most likely 4-2 break West will take 3 clubs.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, West has 5 spades, 1 heart, and at least 3 clubs for 9 tricks and West could open 2@C although I probably wouldn't. However, I would not criticize someone for doing so.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BAnother Kib: ^*nDo you avoid 2@C opening with any kind of 2 suited strong hands as some do?|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Depends on how many HCP I have.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|2C?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should make a takeout double. He doesn't have 4 hearts but AKx is close enough.|

Therefore, he must have a pretty good hand 18 at least but East still has the singleton spade. The 3 clubs are not as worrisome since the takeout double means West is short in clubs.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those who don't like to open 1NT with a 5-card major this hand would have worked out better for them. But most of the time it won't. If I opened 1@S and partner rebid 1NT, which is the most likely rebid I have no way of showing my strength.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the long run, opening 1NT even with a 5-card major is the way to go. Occasionally, when partner has a weak hand and 4-card support you will miss your 9 card fit. But more often you won't.|
