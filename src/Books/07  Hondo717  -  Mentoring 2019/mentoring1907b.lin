up|33|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So double and correct to NT shows a stronger hand than an immediate NT overcall. Nice 3@S bid by North. Although the suit is weak the heart void is very powerful. So I like the bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will usually have 4 spades. Admittedly an 8-card fit is risky after a preempt because the odds of a 4-1 break are greatly increased and the spades are weak. But the heart void is very powerful so 3@S was a fine bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us review whether West should raise spades. I would say it is not a good bid with only 3 spades, a flat hand, and lots of queens and jacks, including the probably worthless @HJ.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although at this vul it has some merit. Turns out it is down 3 plus the 4-1 break causes some issues so could go down 4. In IMPs down 3 doubled (-500) is ok but not great.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In match points it is a good result. But it might go down 4 since the 4-1 break is hard to handle in which case it would be -800.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since East has 6, that means I will usually have a good hand, 18 or so. Sometimes, a little less or a little more. But the point is if you give me free rein to bid you are going to make my life easier.|

Not to mention that you tend to not open 2@C when your suit is a minor because you then have to start the auction at the 3-level (e.g. 2@C-2@D-3@C or 3@D).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do love 5-5 hands and strain to bid with them particularly at this vul (you are not vul, they are not).|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, 2N-P-P means it will be difficult for them to make the hand. Further, you are quite sure at best we have half the deck and you have no way of knowing whether we should be in diamonds or spades. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, your diamond suit is not that great, it would not play well opposite 2 small or even 3 small diamonds. So, all things considered, although 3@D might work out, I would pass. |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As we can see, 2N was the best opening bid and East did pass, which worked out well. At trick 5, can North figure out to lead a diamond back so we beat the hand?|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not obvious. In fact, if I have the @SK North has to lead a spade back. Otherwise if he leads a diamond and I have the @SK, East will be able to take 8 tricks.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, I think the spade was correct, although not on this hand as it turns out. On the other hand, I should mention that an expert pair might have defeated 2NT but most would not. Let me explain.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could have, and I did, told East I had the @DK by the size of the heart I led back on the 3rd heart trick. That should be a suit preference. After the 2nd heart trick, I had @H9732 left (having led the H5 and played the @HQ).|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I could give a suit preference if my partner paid careful attention to the spots. My highest heart (the @H9) would have told North that my entry was in spades--the highest remaining suit. |
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @H2 would have said to lead back the lowest suit (clubs in this case), and the @H7, which you will notice I did lead back and is a "middle" heart (as is the 3 on this hand) says to lead back the middle suit (diamonds in this case). |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, therefore, absent the inference from my heart play, North's spade was a good play.|
