UP|34|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perhaps my instruction to ^*BWest^*n was incorrect on this hand. West told me she was intending to rebid 1NT after the double and 1@H response. A double and correct to NT shows 19-21.|
at|^^^^And, using Bergen evaluation West's hand does value to 19 or even 20. 

That would have been a reasonable choice. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had that happened, then they get to 4@H. Of course, they also get to 4@H if East opens 2@H. Or if East decides to bid 3@H invitational over 2@H which was also possible.|

at|^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, against 6NT you try and make a safe lead. That means you lead a long suit with no honors. Since West has the @CJ, a club, although it could be neutral, is not purely neutral.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay now given the auction what should East bid over 2@S-3@C?|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT|^^^^The ^*bLaw of Total Tricks^*N ^*g:lott::Hand Evaluation, (LINK  -  Law of Total Tricks   LOTT) ^*n is always a good guide. And with a 7-card fit (presumably West is showing 6 spades) you don't want to bid to the 3-level. That violates the law. I would pass in IMPs. In Matchpoints, I might try a double hoping to beat 3@C.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@C we do not do very well. We lose 2 clubs, 2 diamonds 2 hearts and 1 spade. I always like to compete. But knowing when to compete is important and the law of total tricks is the best guideline for knowing when to compete.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*NDoes that mean I shouldn't have bid it?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No 3@C was fine. With a singleton spade, nice clubs, and a good hand, it is the right bid. It just so happens I am weaker than average and all the points are with East.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That wont happen most of the time. In fact over 3@S, I would consider bidding 4@C with your hand. Although that is riskier. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The point here is, East overvalued his HCP and undervalued his distribution. In the sense that with a singleton spade, that is bad on offense and good on defense.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly you have very mediocre spades. But you are a passed hand and partner is not going to play you for much. And, as you saw on this hand, once the opponents have several rounds of bidding it is much harder to judge whether or not to bid spades.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you bid them right away, you avoid the problem and make it harder on the opponents. Now what if East is not a passed hand, I personally still bid 1@S because I like to lay claim to spades on a competitive hand when I can.|

But 2@H is a close 2nd choice. Although you like to raise with 4-card support. if you have nice 3-card support and no better bid, it is Okay to raise to 2 with 3-card support. That bid is more encouraging than 1N.|
