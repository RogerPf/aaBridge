mb|P|mb|P|mb|1D|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has 3 reasonable alternatives. 2@C is one of them and probably what I would choose. Bidding 2@C over 1@D is a very good competitive bid. It is almost as good as preempting because it forces responder to the 2-level and makes it much harder for the opponents to find their major suit fit.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double was another one. It's not a perfect double because North has no 4-card majors. But it is possible (and might have worked out better on this hand as it turns out). The other possibility was 1NT.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has an imperfect 1NT bid because of only a half stopper in diamonds. However, you should strain to bid 1NT if you can.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even though North does not have a stopper, it is a bit safer to bid 1NT because West opened 1 of a minor. Often West is somewhat short in the minor, lessening the danger of bidding with half a stopper.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 1 of a major, if North did not have the major suit stopped, a 1NT overcall would have been more dangerous.|

mb|2d|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like East competing but 3@D is better than 2@D particularly at favorable vulnerability (you are not vul, they are vul).

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 3@D bid worked out well. It got us up to 3@S on an 8-card fit. Even if EW could make 3@D, +100 is still a reasonably good score. And I am not sure they can make 3@D.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They lose 1 spade, 1 heart, 2 clubs, and 1 diamond at least for down 1. And they could easily go down 2.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1D|mb|1H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another bid to consider is 2@H ostensibly a preempt. East is too strong to bid 2@H but since partner is a passed hand it has some tactical merit.|

pg| ***** 50 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this specific auction, the double promises exactly 4 spades. A negative double over a 1@H overcall is very specific. It shows exactly 4 spades. A 1@S bid over 1@H promises 5+.|

MB|1N|mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A tad aggressive particularly vul against not. But with a nice hand and 6-4 distribution, it could work out. However, since I have a likely 2 trump tricks and partner opened, I am going to double.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My double would be clearcut playing match points because +200 (down 1) rates to be a top board. But in IMPs it is a bit riskier because I am doubling them into game.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should only double part scores when you have a lot of trump. Otherwise it is too risky. Even here, we barely beat the hand although East was fortunate that he guessed the clubs, He might easily have lost another club trick and gone for 500.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, it was unlucky he lost 2 heart tricks, BTW, I think NS make 2@S. They take 3 trump tricks by length, 2 diamond tricks, a heart is 7, and a 2nd heart ruff perhaps.|

sk|s|mb|Pp?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That gives me a problem. I am not bidding 5@H as we could easily be losing 3 diamond tricks. But the question is, should I double. In Matchpoints, I probably should hoping to take at least 2 clubs, 1 spade, and 1 heart.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in IMPs probably not. It is unlikely to be down 2. They likely have a 9 card spade fit. In general, when someone opens a weak 2, their most likely distribution in any side suit is 2 cards. It is possible they only have an 8 card fit if partner has 3 spades but more likely a 9 card fit.|

sb|s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We could be taking 2 heart tricks but that seems unlikely.

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S over 4@H is almost always a good bid. So I like West's bid, especially at favorable vulnerability.We make 4@H. East/West would take 3 diamonds off the top. But then because of our running clubs, North can draw trump and run clubs and take the rest of the tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If we played that, then North could overcall 1NT. But if we don't then I don't think stretching to bid 1NT is a good idea. I prefer the pass.|mb|P|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. Pass was fine by West given East passed originally. But had East not been a passed hand, West's best rebid was 1NT despite the lack of a club stopper. The 1NT rebid is more of a description (12-14 and not 4-card support for partner) rather than showing stoppers in all unbid suits.|
