nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The biggest point to remember on this hand is the 3@H bid in 2/1. Unlike SAYC, it does not show 16-18. It does not show a particular point count. It simply shows a self sufficient heart suit (at most one loser opposite a singleton) and asks partner to control bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a 3@H bid you want to leave more room to explore for slam when you have more than a minimum.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another alternative is to try and set up my spades with a couple of ruffs. Then I will take 3 spades, 2 hearts, one diamond, and 2 clubs or maybe 4 spades. That's no good either.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are very few hands where you want to play in 5 of a minor rather than 3NT. But West holds a hand that might be a candidate. By bidding 3@H, West gives a good description of his hand. This is a bid that rarely comes up, but is useful when it does.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|p?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East knows she has at most 1 heart loser and probably no club losers. The question is how many spade and diamond losers does she have. Partner is probably short in diamonds since he has shown 5 spades and 4 or 5 clubs. So if partner has the @DA, perhaps no diamond losers.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, if partner has the @DA and @SA, the hand probably makes 5 clubs. It might also make 3N. But if partner has, say, the @DA, and @SKQ, it still makes 5@C and 3N is on the diamond finesse.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid 4@D as a control bid in case partner is interested in slam. That denies a spade control and shows a diamond control.|

PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, although 5@C was reasonable, so was 3NT. If you play all of your contracts in 3NT rather than 5 of a minor, you will be right much more often than wrong. It is much easier to take 9 tricks than 11.|

Because you count |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at| for the hand that has the long trump suit.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Usually the hand with the longer trumps bids the suit first and ends up as declarer. But with transfer auctions they don't. So think of "Declarer Points" as "Player with Long Trump Points."|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 15 HCP and 1 length point for 16 Begen Declarer Points. Granted partner might only have 15 or 16. But I am willing to look for slam if we have enough key cards. Thus, I bid 4N asking for keycards.|mb|4N|

pc|HT|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the lead, against a suit slam you often make an attacking lead, although in this case it doesn't work well. I would have led a club, which really works well for declarer.|

sk|n|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the trick, with the heart lead, I have 4 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 2 clubs, for 10 tricks. I need 2 more tricks. If the spade finesse works, that's 11 tricks. I can set up a 3rd club for a 12th trick. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the spade finesse loses, I will finesse against East for the @CQ. If that works, that gives me a 3rd club trick. If the @CQ does not come down in 3 rounds, I can set up a 4th club trick by ruffing a club and that will give me 12 tricks. That is what I will do.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear what North should do. With a slightly stronger hand, North could try 3@H asking me to bid 3N with a heart stopper. But I think 3@D here is probably best as game in diamonds is very unlikely.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further,I might bid 2N with 11ish points some diamonds and a heart stopper. |
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, over 2@D East might have made a flawed takeout double. The diamond singleton is great. But having only 3 spades, although possible, is a bit worrisome. 2@H is another possibility.|
