nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They probably end up in 3@D anyway since we should not bid 3@H with only an 8-card fit and no singletons.|

at|^^^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general when you pull partner's overcall to a new suit you are showing a longish suit. In fact, many experts play new suits after an overcall are not forcing. |

Further, with a self sufficient suit (meaning it is likely 1 loser even opposite a singleton) I think 4@H is the best call.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D as another option by East has problems. First of all it is not forcing. New suits by RESPONDER are forcing but new suits by OPENER are not. Further, it promises 4+ diamonds and it tends to deny 6 hearts.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My choice is 4@H. But a conservative 3@H would not be bad. Unfortunately they have a bad fit. It turns out West's hand is just about useless.|

mb|PPP|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I 100% agree with North's pass. However there are many people who advocate light openers in 3rd seat and might open 1@C. I don't see the point.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Other than frisky preempts, I am not a big fan of light openers in 3rd seat at the 1-level. When you do that, now partner never knows how strong or weak you are. making it much harder for partner to judge. I am a Rule of 20 guy in all seats.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


mb|1C|mb|P|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|
cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, North has 2 choices of balancing bids. My choice is 1NT which shows 11-14 balanced (11-12 since North is a passed hand). The other choice is a takeout double.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


sb|n|mb|1N|mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's double shows a strong hand, since West passed probably a balanced hand with 18+. With a balanced 15-17 East would have opened 1NT.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I could pass because it is likely that West is going to bid something, But I also advocate playing "DONT runouts" when the opponents double my 1NT openers or overcalls.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They work similarly to DONT except for suit length. A suit by me would show the suit I bid plus a higher suit. For example if I were playing DONT runouts and bid 2@D that would show diamonds and a major.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*nYou also use Delayed DONT with balancing NT?|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT in the pass out seat is balancing NT showing 11-14 (but since North passed it has to be 11-12 on this auction). |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And yes, you still play the same conventions (e.g. Stayman, Transfers, etc.) over a balancing 1NT. You just adjust the HCP range.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I bid a suit here, it shows a 2 suited hand, that suit and another suit. If I redouble here, that is similar to a DONT double showing a 1 suited hand.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, since I know partner has at least a doubleton in every suit the suit length requirements for DONT runouts are shorter than for DONT overcalls.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I only need a 5-card suit to redouble (since I know partner has at least 2) and I can bid 4-4 to show 2 suits (since partner almost always has 1 doubleton at most).|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I am redoubling. If West passed, North has to bid 2@C and I will bid my suit. However on this hand I think West has a clear action.|mb|R|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the 3@C bid. Since East has at least 3 clubs (and will have 4 clubs 85% of the time), EW are assured of an 8-card fit and will usually have a 9-card fit. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Plus West has a singleton (probably in the opponents' suit) which is always nice on offense. With no defense West wants to declare, not defend. Since West passed originally, East is not going to think West has much in the way of HCP.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is okay by North. But if he chose to double that is NOT penalty. It would tell me to bid my suit. However, with lots of club points and a [level] flat hand I think pass is best.|

mb|D|mb|2D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My next bid depends on whether or not you play a convention known as Smolen. Personally I am not a big fan of Smolen. The way I play, when I bid 3@H, that shows a game forcing hand with 5 hearts and 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, some players think it is preferable that the NT bidder be declarer and have their hand hidden so they play a convention called Smolen.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play that, then I would bid 3@S (my 4-card major) to show 5 hearts and 4 spades. And that means if partner wants to play in hearts he is the first one to bid hearts and ends up as declarer.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I think it is vastly overrated to worry about whether or not the 1NT bidder declares or not and it is easy to forget Smolen as it rarely comes up.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general I prefer natural bids when I have a choice. So I am bidding 3@H to show my 5 hearts and partner will bid 3N since she doesn't have hearts.|mb|3H|

PG| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North needs to give herself the best chance of making the contract while she still has clubs stopped. She can count 4 hearts, 2 clubs, 1 diamond, and 1 spade for sure once the @HA and @HQ fall. So on the diamond she needs to finesse.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That works on this hand for 9 tricks. But even if that loses she can fall back on the spade finesse. Plus, since  East is out of clubs, even if the spade finesse loses, the opponents can't run clubs and the @SJ provides declarer with her 9th trick.|

up|28|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, 5@D is down on a club lead. But a spade lead is the normal lead on this auction, and there is no way for East to know to lead a club. |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On many hands, the fate of the contract depends on the opening lead. Even experts sometime fail to make the best opening lead, and most experts would lead a spade on this hand. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All you can do is follow the general principles for good opening leads. Those give you the best chance for finding the correct lead more often than not.|
