UP|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|@CJ turns out to be a good lead. But not sure I would make it. Often in a splinter auction, a trump is a good lead and leading away from KJ10 in a suit contract can be dangerous. |

The hand has 10 HCP, -1 for dubious @HQ, and 10 cards in the minors. So 1@C bid is okay. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, tactically I think 3@C is a better bid because I think your hand more closely resembles a 3@C bid than a 1@C bid. When short in the majors, I love to preempt. Not to mention that partner has a better picture of your distribution when you preempt.|mb|3C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West was a little unlucky to go down. But lack of planning contributed to the problem. Also, West did not think about managing the entries to dummy.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


AT|

As we will see in the alternative version of how to play the hand, Howard would have played the hand differently. But, even given the way West started the play, the hand should still make. 

After losing the @h finesse, West can still make the hand by managing entries and counting winners. 

If West can get to dummy once trump are out, West can end up taking 4 @s tricks, 2 @d tricks, 1 @c ruff, and 4 @h tricks. |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|

So West can guarantee the contract as follows. When North plays a @d after winning the @HQ, West plays the @DA. West draws 3 rounds of trump. Then West cashes the @HA and @HK. West can then lead to the @DK and play 2 @h winners.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT| 

However, the way West played the hand, by ruffing an extra @c in dummy, there were no entries to dummy to cash dummy's good @h's once the @HA and @HK were unblocked. 

So West ended up losing 2 @c tricks because there was no way to get rid of those losers.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BMM: ^*nAnd the rumors have it that Kia declared the first version. We tend to believe the rumors.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As usual, West should count winners before deciding how to play. West has 4 top spade winners, 2 top diamond winners, and 2 top heart winners. That's 8 tricks. Additionally, dummy has already ruffed a club for a 9th trick. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|

There are a number of ways to establish a 10th winner. The easiest way is to ruff another club. So, West should ruff the opening club lead. West is now planning to lead a low heart to the HA, ruff another club, draw trump, and claim at least 10 tricks.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

However, on the actual hand, luckily the HQ drops, meaning West can take 3 additional heart tricks besides the 10 tricks already planned for. So West can ruff a 2nd club, as planned. Then draw trump, cash dummy's good hearts and diamonds, and take the last trump in West's hand, taking all 13 tricks.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|

The point here is, by careful planning West can guarantee the contract. And when West gets a lucky break, because of the careful planning, West is able to take advantage of that luck and take additional tricks. But even without the HQ falling, West's planned line of play will result in at least 10 tricks.|
