sb|s|cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Although at this vul it carries some risk but I don't dislike it. Certainly, 2@D, at least, is a good bid.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |

PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. A 2-level overcall normally shows at least 10 points and a 6-card suit or a nice (quality or near quality) 5-card suit. Admittedly, North only has 6 HCP. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However with 6-4 distirbution and the very nice 6-card suit, his hand is worth much more than 6 points. So at this vulnerability, 2@D is another possible bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent the 1@S bid, it is marginal since the @SJx of spades is dubious. But once East opens 1@S, the @SJ is worth 1 point. That gives West 12 HCP and 4-4 in the minors which meets the rule of 20.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is how many diamonds should I bid. By |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| I can bid 3@D since I know partner has at least 4. But it is not clear that is preemptive so I will stick with 2@D.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is an expert bid. Partner doesn't know you also have a heart fit. But since you have a spade fit it doesn't matter.|

PG| ***** 121 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. Don't give them extra bids. I already know you have diamonds. You don't have to tell me again.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double, in fact, would suggests a diamond sac. I am not sure you want to do that.|

mb|P|mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid by East. His @DAK does not fit well with West and he, therefore, has probably less than a min opener given the auction.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has to pass. He invited partner to bid slam and he refused.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a bit of an unlucky hand for West. It does show you that 5-3 fits are not nearly as good as 5-4 fits because 1/3 of the time, you get a 4-1 (or 5-0) break. |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And that can sink a hand, as it did here.|
