mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over Jacoby 2NT you bid a singleton or void if you have it. The other alternative, rare, but applicable here is to bid a 5-card suit with 2 of the top 3 at the 4 level. This takes precedence over showing shortness. So East's proper response is 4@H.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a rare response that many students don't know about but is useful to show a source of tricks for slam.|mb|4H|

PG| ***** 5 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. It shows 5 hearts with 2 of the top 3. Further, by definition since East also has 5 spades. Therefore, East must be short in at least one minor (either 2-1 or 3-0).|

(1 QT in spades, 1 in hearts, 2 in diamonds) and can count 9 winners. East has 1 spade winner and the heart suit is worth 4 winners normally assuming West as an average length. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What is West's average length?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|^^
There are 8 hearts remaining. If they are evenly divided, each player would have 2 2/3. Since you can't hold 2/3 of a card, that means West would usually have either 2 or 3 hearts. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, assuming normal breaks, East can count 4 heart tricks. So 1 spade trick, 4 heart tricks, and 4 diamond tricks using the same logic gives East 9 tricks. Therefore East should open 2@C.|

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It's nothing. It's just how you calculate the average number of cards for partner. It basically means, in this deal, on average partner will hold 3 cards more of the time than 2 cards in hearts. Anyway East should open 2@C.|UB||
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|at|^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nCould East consider bidding a Diamond preparing to reverse into hearts?|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. You never distort your distribution. With 5-5 you never open your lower ranking suit. You describe your 2 suiter and let partner choose.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Occasionally when you are 5-6 with a weak hand, you might open your 5 card suit. But that happens infrequently.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, the @DQ happens to come down doubleton on this hand but by playing a low diamond early, West is guaranteeing the contract--4 diamonds, 3 heart plus the 2 tricks already won.|pc|D2|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It's okay to play in NT with a void if you are confident partner can stop the suit. It really doesn't matter who should be the declarer.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You just need an agreement. Personally, I prefer giving 3-card support priority over a 4-card major because, despite what you may hear, a 5-3 fit is usually better and safer than a 4-4 fit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, if you want to bid the 4-card major, that's fine. You just need to agree. As I said, on this hand, East's only bid is 3@H.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 3@H West should bid 3N and if East did have 4 spades they should correct to 4@S.|mb|3N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's true. East has 18-19 points which means the total assets of EW are 27-28 far short of bidding slam.|
