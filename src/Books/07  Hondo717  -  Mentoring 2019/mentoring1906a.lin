mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will accept a pass right now although I think East should bid 5@D with the heart void and nice diamonds.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

Normally I would deduct 1 for dubious club Qx but since partner opened 1@C I no longer do that. So I have 10 HCP, 2 length points 1 quality suit point.|

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once we have a heart fit my addons are 1 point for doubleton and 1 point for 6th heart after a fit. Partner showing 17-19, so we are in the slam zone.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I will control bid 4@D. That shows slam interest, a diamond control, and, just as importantly, and lack of a club control or spade control.|mb|4D|an|!d ctrl, no !s or !c ctrl|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|SB|NWhat sould I bid now?|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


SB|N|
nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should not be interested in slam without controls in one of those 2 suits. In this deal, since North has controls in both those suits, he could decide to show slam interest. Having said that, with only 11 HCP and a non-solid club suit 4@H would be reasonable as well.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming North is interested in slam, with controls in clubs and spades, needs to bid RKCB. And when hearts are trmps, when bidding RKCB I recommend you should bid |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=kickback,"Kickback"^*N|CP||FP||at| RKCB which means you should use 4@S rather than 4NT as RKCB.|

n#|9|at|^^^fIf you do follow the link you can return  HERE  by clicking the  |fp|1|n#|3|at|@L|fp||n^|3|at|   icon button, top left.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That allows you to do the queen ask if need be. If you use 4NT as RKCB over 4@H and responder bids 5@D (1 or 4 if playing 0314) you have no way of doing the queen ask without going past 5@H.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whereas if you bid 4@S and responder bids 5@C to show 1 or 4, you can bid 5@D to do queen ask. That is the reason to bid 4@S rather than 4N.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


mb|4S|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In a usual trumps distribution, South has 2 key cards without the queen, and the response over 4@S is a 5@D response (4N = 0 or 3, 5@C = 1 or 4, 5@D = 2 no HQ, and 5@H = 2 w HQ).|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, however, I actually should respond as if I have the @HQ because 5@H response is 2 keys with a) the queen or b) enough length where the queen doesn't matter.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I know we have a 10 card fit because 3@H promises 4 hearts. So I have enough length where, assuming the normal 2-1 break, the queen will come down. Therefore, I respond 5@H (2 with queen or 10+ card trump length).|mb|5H|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bid by North, the rule is, the RKCB bidder should bid 6 if we have 5 keys or 4 keys and the trump queen.|mb|6H|

pc|DQ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will let the @DQ stand. Normally that should show the @DJ or a doubleton which is impossible given the diamond raise in this auction. The correct lead would be the @D2.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I didn't necessarily show the @DA although likely. I showed the @DA, @DK, singleton or void--1st or 2nd round control.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to my plan, I can take 6 hearts, 1 spade, and 1 diamond for sure. Therefore, I need 4 more tricks. 1 club would be available as is 2 diamond ruffs, but that's only 11.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to try and set up clubs, instead, and take 4 clubs (at least), 6 hearts, and 2 aces.|

sk|s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's draw trump now. If I get a 2-1 break I am fine. But if someone is void then I need to finesse against the queen. Who would be more likely to be void?|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East. Because East showed a 5+-card suit. So East is more likely to be void, not a lot more likely. Therefore, I am playing that, if hearts are 3-0.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all let's see how well Bergen evaluation did compared to normal hand evaluation. North has 11 HCP and South has 10 HCP. So we just bid a slam on 21 HCP. That was a reasonable slam.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, the slam can be defeated as it turns out with a spade lead. In general, my rule is, if you lead partner's suit you never lose the post mortem. Therefore, I can't fault West for leading a diamond. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with the KQ of spades, it might occur to lead a spade and if there is a spade lead, 6@H does go down because I can't set up clubs before losing 1 club and 1 spade.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's go back and see what happens if East bids 5@D, as I would have. 

I probably double rather than bidding 5@H because "the 5 level belongs to the opponents" meaning that usually it is better to double than bid 5 over 5.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do have the @DA: and a possible club ruff. If 5@D doubles is the contract, then I lead the @CQ and we end up taking the @CK, the @SA, and the @DA for down 1 in 5@D.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is much better for EW than our making a game, much less a slam.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again proving aggressive bidding pays off particularly with the "magic of voids." When you have a void, your hand ends up taking many more tricks than you might otherwise as this hand demonstrates.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice bid by North. That is |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| showing hearts and spades. At least 5-4 (5-card suit could be either).|

mb|3H?|sk|w|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most pairs wouldn't know what to do here. I would just bid 3N. West doesn't have a sure spade stopper. But has a semi-stopper and partner is likely to have points somewhere.|

pc|H6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the auction and the fact that there is only one heart lower than the 6 out, hearts are likely to be 4-4. So West is probably only going to lose 3 heart tricks.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West can count 4 club tricks, 1 heart, 2 spades, and 1 diamond for sure. That's only 8 tricks unfortunately. So West has to hope the diamond finesse is working which given the DONT bid is more likely than not. Although turns out not to be the case here. |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would duck a heart or two, knock out the @SA, run clubs, and take the Diamond finesse.|

mb|P|mb|1H|mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am tempted to bid 2@C with my nice 6-card suit and singleton. But there are several reasons why I will pass. One is I really should have more HCP. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And the other reason, which many player are not aware of is the fact that I hold 3 hearts. Holding 3 cards in an opponent's suit is your worst holding. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Especially if they haven't found a fit yet because you could easily have 3 losers. Also I am at unfavorable vulnerability (I am, they are not) which is the worst time to make marginal bids. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you reversed my hearts and diamonds, then I might be tempted to bid 2@C or even 3@C despite the vul. But here I have to pass.|mb|P|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


mb|1S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 17 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, and 3 points for singleton with 4 trump. 

That's 22 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Bergen Dummy Points ^*N|CP||FP||at|, more than enough to bid game opposite 6. So East should bid at least 4@S. 
However, a better bid is 4@C, |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=splinters,Splinter^*N|CP||FP||at|. And yes, you can splinter with a singleton ace.|

up|38|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out if North figures out I have a singleton diamond we hold it to 5. But otherwise, even if North leads another suit they always make 6. They take 5 spades by length, 5 hearts, 1 club, and  1 club ruff.|
