mb|1N|mb|P|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C is a reasonable bid. Another reasonable bid is to just bid 3NT with a balanced 4-3-3-3 Game Force hand especially with a mediocre suit. The spade suit is not that mediocre as it does have 2 honors.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A small issue is we (N/S) might end up competing or doubling for a lead but not that important to worry about. I might have doubled for a club lead and that works out on this hand. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But since I only have one honor in clubs that might not be our best lead in general. Regardless, when in doubt, if you can make a lead directing double you should do so even on this hand it would have worked much better.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now in general you should use up the honors from the short side first which is what West did in diamonds. However, there is slightly better technique on this particularly holding. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West leads the @DK first and then a diamond to the ace he can pick up a 4-1 break if I have Jxxx in diamonds without wasting any dummy entries.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So that is a slightly better way to play the hand here although it doesn't matter as it turns out. On this hand, West shouldn't play spades for an extra trick. He should set up a sure club trick although it turned out not to matter.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is very likely that it doesn't make any difference whether or not declarer plays the @SQ. Given the auction, it is almost certain that South has the @SK. |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, if North started with the @SJ, and East plays a low spade, it is possible that South might make a mistake. If South has the @SK10 without the @SJ, he might incorrectly play the @SK. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He shouldn't, because North would never lead away from an ace in a suit contract. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the @S10 would be the correct play. If partner started with the @SJ, then the @S10 will force out the @SA and South's @SK will be good. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If declarer started with the @SAJ, then playing the @S10 doesn't cost anything either. |

up|38|cp|8|AT|^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is not a particularlly easy hand to play. The other way to play the club suit is to lead low towards the A10 to start with. If that loses to the jack (as it will), then play the @CQ from the West hand and hope North has the @CK (which he did).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That way you only lose 1 club trick so long as North has at least one honor. This is known as a "suit combination" and knowing how to handle suit combinations is a good skill to learn. However, experts don't memorize suit combinations.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They just figure them out for the most part and then remember them since they play a lot of bridge.
Your line was reasonable as well. Just not quite as good.

Against most non-experts if I had the @CK I would go up with it. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the way you played clubs was fine as it is likely you will only lose 1 club unless unluckily North has both the King and Jack. Playing against an expert however, they would duck the low club from dummy even with the @CK.|
