nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West had a singleton or void, I think 4@H is best, but with 6-3-3-2 distribution, it is not as clear. Singletons and voids are huge assets on offense.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, we still get to 4@S. But let's see how 4@H does. They lose 2 spades, 1 heart, and 2 diamond for down 2. It is better than us making 4@S even if doubled. But as I said we are getting to 4@S even if West bids 4@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@H sacrifice is an interesting question. With 6-3-2-2 distribution and equal vulnerability 5@H is iffy particularly in IMPs. I probably wouldn't do it in Matchpoints either but it is less clear.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Rule of 15 says you should not open in 4th seat unless your HCP + spades is 15 or more. I think that is pretty much nonsense frankly. If you have an opener in 4th seat (rule of 20) then open. If you don't, don't open.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at|, many players open light in 3rd seat. I am also not a big fan of that, although that has merit. The reason being, if you open light in 3rd seat, then partner never knows if you have a real opener and that will cast doubt in his mind as to how much to compete.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I use rule of 20 even in 3rd seat (although I might occasionally stretch if I have a nice suit). However, I will make very light preempts in 3rd seat. On this hand West has a clear rule of 20 opener (11 HCP and 9 cards in the minors).|

mb|P|mb|1S|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2C|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a tough rebid which is why if she opened 2@S she wouldn't have the problem. Her choices are pass, 2@S, 2N, or 3@S (invitational). If her spades were better I might choose 3@S but here I think it is wrong since her spade suit plays terribly opposite a singleton.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


mb|2N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N is conceivable but dangerous. Partner probably has 14 or less. So they have at most 24. In Matchpoints I would bid 2@S since 2@S is worth more than 2@C. But in IMPs not clear what to do.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play you should super accept any time you have 4 trump regardless of strength. Some players only super accept with 4 trump and a good 16 or 17.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I disagree with those players and there is a more sophisticated way to super accept which I like. With 4 trump, rather than just jumping to 3@S (when transfer is to spades), you bid a suit in which you have a doubleton.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, here  with West hand, I would bid 3@C rather than 3@S with the West hand playing sophisticated super accepts. That gives partner even more information. But that hardly ever comes up.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now North should cash the @CQ. That is the setting trick. Since West opened 1NT it is 100% clear that West has at least one more club. Not to mention North can figure out West has the @DQ,since if I started with @DAQ, I would have played the @DQ at trick 1.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All of these inferences are important to have when you defend which is why defense is so hard. You must be a good bridge detective and pay attention to all of your clues (both the bidding and the play).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However on this hand, since I happen to have 3 cards in diamonds and spades and 4 cards in hearts even though I would normally pass with 3 clubs I will bid 2@D because it is possible we end up in a better fit.|
