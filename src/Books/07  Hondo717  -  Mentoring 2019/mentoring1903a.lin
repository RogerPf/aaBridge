mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using a basic Rule of 20 methodology, East has 11 HCP and 9 cards in their 2 longest suits, so technically the hand is an opener. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you use the Bergen adjustment of deducting 1 point for the dubious singleton @HQ the hand does not meet the Rule of 20. Therefore, pass is fine.|

I have a flat 11 with only 8 cards in my 2 longest suits so I don't meet the Rule of 20. So I pass although many would open 1@D in 3rd seat.|mb|P|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has the @HQ. But if she asked for queen, you bid 5@H (no queen). That's the whole point of playing Kickback because had you been playing 4N as RKCB you would have bid 5@D and partner could not do the Queen Ask.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think most everyone should play Kickback. That is, as here, you should use 4@S as RKCB when hearts is trump. That allows you to do the queen ask when the response is the 2nd step because you can do the Queen Ask over a 5@C response to 4@S.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rest of Kickback involves RKCB when a minor suit is trump. Some play that 4@D is RKCB when clubs is trump and 4@H is RKCB when diamonds are trump. That is part of advanced Kickback. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not suggesting you play that because it can get very complicated as to when 4@D or 4@H is RKCB and when it is not. Just start with 4@S (Kickback) as RKCB for hearts. |

MB|P|AT| Then what should I bid?. Many players will only raise to 2@H with 4-card support. And most of the time, if I bid 2@H that shows 4 hearts. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you should not be reluctant to raise with nice 3-card support and shortness. On this hand, all experts would bid 2@H over 1@H when East passes. It is very clear to do so.|

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing support redoubles, 1@S denies 3 hearts. So the redouble does not deny 4 spades and not redoubling does deny 3 hearts. "Support with support" is always a good idea. But what about if East had passed. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had 4 hearts I bid 2@H even if I have 4 spade. With the hand where I do have 3 hearts and 4 spades, with 4 nice spades I would tend to bid 1@S and then to show 4-3-1-5 distribution rebid 2@H. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |

AT|^^^^Absolutely not. It was very lucky they made 3. The @CA was onside and they rate to lose 2 diamonds more often than not. So 3@S could easily go down, losing 2 clubs 2 diamonds and the @HA. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, 3@S is the right spot. So let me give my occasional rant against the double dummy analysis sheets given out by most duplicate clubs these days. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They would indicate EW can make 4@S which would leave many players to assume they should be in 4@S. But just because a contract makes because of a very lucky distribution it doesn't mean you should bid it.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this layout, with the EW cards, if you bid 4@S, you would get a very bad board most of the time. You get a top board  about 5%, of times and 95% you get a bottom. Perhaps a slight exaggeration but you get my point. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don't pay a lot of attention to the double dummy analysis. Figure out whether or not a contract has a good chance of making based on the odds and not on the actual layout of the defense.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*NWhat about if I had 4 cards in spades? Do I bid 4@S then regardless?|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, with 3-card support you raise to 3 even if weak. The only time you don't is if you have enough points to bid 4 or you have invitational values and bid 2N to elicit more info from partner.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Both the raise to 3 with 3-card support and the raise to 4 with 4-card support is based on the Law Of Total Tricks. With 4-3-3-3 you can deduct one from the Law of Total Tricks.|
