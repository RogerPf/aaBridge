mb|P|mb|P|mb|3C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3rd seat is the best time to preempt. I have a standard 3@C preempt. But even if I had only a 6-card suit or a very weak suit, I still should preempt. It is almost certain West has a strong hand.|

mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|sk|e|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is okay. East does have 11 official HCP, although the @CQ is probably not that useful since I am very likely to have the @CK. However, if they end up in hearts, I will be on lead and the @CQ will mean that if I lead clubs, East will get 2 club tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| You could make a case that East should bid 4@H. But 3@H is fine particularly with only a 4-card suit.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 4@C. East now loves his hand. He has nice spade support and the @CA. It is possible that slam may make. So he should bid 4@C He has already limited his hand by not bidding 4@H. The most he can have is 9 working points or so. So he might as well make a slam try.|mb|4C|

mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the 1@S opener and the hand does meet the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at|. The @HAQ doubleton is a flaw. Having more than half of your HCP in a short suit is a problem too. But despite that I love the 5-5 distribution and the tens in both long suits. However, I would not criticize a pass.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West wants to be in game, but isn't really strong enough to bid 2N. But West has two good bids. One is aggressive--4@D--and the other is not very aggressive--3@D.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What you can make here is a limit raise, 3@D, to show 10-12 and 4 card support (very conservative count). Then bid 4@S even if partner only bids 3@S. That sequence shows a hand that wants to play in 4@S but is not quite strong enough to make a nice game force.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely played. This hand illustrates the power of Bergen evaluation. A lot of pairs would not get to game holding only 21 combined HCP. But Bergen evaluation lets you upgrade hands once you find a fit.|

PG| ***** 147 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I might wimp out and make a Bergen Limit Raise, 3@D, and then bid 4@S as I originally recommended because most of my partners are too aggressive and I don't like to encourage them unnecessarily.|mb|p|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 4@D splinter is not what East wants to hear with the @DK and a 5-card suit. When partner splinters you totally discount honors other than the ace in that suit. Your best holding are 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the ace.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have that holding then you love your hand because you have a good fit. But East's diamond holding indicates a misfit. So east bids 4@S.|
