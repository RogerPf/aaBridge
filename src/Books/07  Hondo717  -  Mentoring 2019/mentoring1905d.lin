up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This shows why preempts are effective. It is not clear what East should bid. Although East has a lot of HCP (18) and a really nice suit the hand has flaws.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of the biggest flaws is the 3 little spades.Any time you have 3 little in an opponent's suit, that is a major problem unless you are sure partner is short because you have 3 potential losers off the bat.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also the singleton @DK is a flaw. If we change East's hand to @Sx @HAKQ10x @DKxx @cAQJx, the same number of HCP but 3 diamonds and 1 spade, then I think 4@H is a reasonable bid.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with East's hand as it is, 4@H is somewhat risky. On the other hand, I think 3@H is fine. The 3rd choice is double and correct. And the fact that I had no spades was really crucial.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had been able to lead a spade then that would take dummy's entry away and East would not be able to discard on the @DA. So, although it turns out 4@H makes, it is not that good a contract.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Besides not getting a spade lead, hearts were 3-3 and the club finesse worked plus the @CK was doubleton. So a lot of things worked on the hand. Just looking at the EW hands, I would not be unhappy only being
 in 3@H.|

PG| ***** 53 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT openers are 15-17 in all seats. Unless you have an explicit agreement 1NT in 3rd seat is still 15-17. And if you have an agreement that you can open a light 1NT in 3rd seat you have to alert it.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me explain what I can bid over an overcalled 1N. The standard meaning of double over 1NT overcalls is penalty. Personally, I like to play something called "Delayed DONT." That is very non-standard but I think it works out well a lot.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*nExplain please.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|DONT is used over 1NT opener. Delayed DONT is used over 1NT bids other than opener.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I doubled that would show a single suited hand and if I bid a suit that would show 5-4 or 5-5 in the suit bid and a higher ranking suit (not counting diamonds since partner bid 1@D).|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if I bid say 2@C here, that would have shown clubs and a higher suit except diamonds here. Here I will just compete by bidding 2@D. since partner almost always has 4 diamonds.|mb|2D|

pc|D3|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Same lead I would have made although it happens to give away a trick unfortunately. I always blame partner when that happens telling he or she "a better partner would have a diamond honor."|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 9 likely tricks at least-3 diamonds on that lead, 1 heart, and 2 spades-or maybe 10 or 11.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So let me start with clubs. The best way to play this suit combination is to lead the @CA and hope that either an honor falls or they are 2-2 which would give us at least 4 club tricks. On a good day East would have the singleton @CK and I would make 5 club tricks.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only time I only take 3 club tricks (assuming no worse than 3-1) is when East has KJx in clubs.|
