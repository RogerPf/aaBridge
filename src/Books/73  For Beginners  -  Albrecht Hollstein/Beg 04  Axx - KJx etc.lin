A good defender will play the Q from Q10x to suggest he splits his honors from KQx.

pc|hq|nt|This is a very good slam, though not easy to bid with a natural system.|
at| 3NT shows 25-27 HCP. 
To bid an inviting 4NT with 5 HCP is a very optimistic move by North.
But this is not the topic of this lesson. Let us concentrate on the declarer play:|
pg||nt|You count exactly 7 tricks in @s, @h and @c, so you need 5 tricks from the @ds.|
pg||at|
That seems plain sailing. With 9 cards including A, K and Q, there should be no problem to score 5 @ds tricks.|
pg||nt|BUT be cautious.|cs|2|at|

{Whenever your contract seems to be foolproof, consider, what will happen in the worst case.}
^-|
pg||sb|SThe worst case would be, if one defender holds Jxxx in diamonds.|
pg||nt|Correct. But your contract is foolproof, if you play the @ds in the correct way.|
pg||pc|hhha|at|
There is no reason not to take the lead in the short hand and in the hand with more entries.|
pg||at|
But what now and why? |
pg||lb|*cWhich card do you play now?^^da^dad4|
nt|If both opponents follow to the first round of @ds you can claim your contract,|
at| because you'll be able to draw their pips (small cards) in 3 rounds with A, K and Q.
Retaining Q10 in dummy and K9 in your hand you can successful finesse the J no matter, which defender shows out.
Therefore it is necessary to start with @dA or @dK. If you lead low to the Q and EAST happens to show out, you'll go down.|

In this lesson are demonstrated only a few basic examples.}

but to learn the basic principles and practice them by trial and error.}|
