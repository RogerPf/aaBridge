Sure, you had 12 tricks, if the @dQ were onside. But it was not your goal to make 12 tricks. Your bid is 3NT and your only job is to ensure 1 additional trick to make your contract.

@hs will provide the one needed trick.
But be careful with the entries to dummy. 
Don't waste the @sA early. You need it to reach dummy after the @h trick is established.

pg||nt|This is an easy hand in IMP-scoring. You can guarantee 9 tricks with 100%.
But in MP-scoring you should probably try for overtricks by finessing the@dQ. 
On the other hand, if the @dQ is onside you should have bid slam and you should play on the assumption that your bidding was right.".
Very difficult decision indeed|

@ds can make at 3 additional tricks, if the suit is distributed 3-2, which is about 68%.|
pg||sb|SGreat, let us go for that and hope for the best.|
pg||nt|NOPE! Wait and think ahead. 
To establish the @ds you'll loose the lead twice for sure and defenders will establish their @s-suit.
You'll loose at least 2@ss + 1@h + 2@ds = 5 tricks for one down. So you cannot win playing on @ds.|sb|s|
pg||at|
The only chance to develop two additional tricks are @hs. You can play @hs only once, so you must hope that West has the @HJ.|
pg||at||sb|SBut it is only 50% chance (it can be either at West or at East)!|
pg||nt|True, and it is less than 68% chance (for 3-2 diamonds distribution), but this is your ^*Bonly chance^*N to make the contract.|

pg||at|
Opponents will take the @cA and cash at least 4 @s-tricks for down one.

pg||sb|S|nt|The only chance for winning the contract is to search for the 9th trick in @h taking the 50% heart finesse (@hQ can be either at West or at East).|
pg||sb|SAny problem with entries, blocking...?|at|
There is no danger in holding up the first @s. After winning the @s trick we have another entry to the table in @dJ, so we should play small @h to the @hK first just in case the @hQ is stiff. Then we can test @ds, go back to the table in @dJ and finesse the @HJ.|

{The plan for a NT contract consists of the following steps:

2) Calculate how many additional tricks are needed to make your bid.
3) Decide from which suit these tricks may come from.
4) Be aware what can damage your plan.
