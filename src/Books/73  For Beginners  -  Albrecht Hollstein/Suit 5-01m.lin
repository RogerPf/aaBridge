nt|Grrrrrrrrrr - the lead is threatening as it sets-up 3 immediate @c's losers. Also you cannot avoid a trump-loser and must hope for a 3/2 distribution. You have enough discards for all of your side-losers. But they will ruff before you could discard all your @cs and cash one or 2 @cs. 
Think of an old friend...|pg||
nt|Yes. Your friend the 'coup en blanc'. Remember him whenever you cannot pull all trumps because you have immediate losers in your hand and you need the trumps in dummy to protect them. So after taking the lead, play a small trump from both hands and notice how the remaining dummy trump prevents the opps from cashing their @cs.... They are limited to 1 trump trick....|pg||

nt|Same contract as before, but another lead. Analysis: the lead created an immediate heart loser and you have an unavoidable trump loser. But you still have sufficient @d's extra winners to discard your losers.|
pg||
at| Plan: a coup en blanc? Do not even think of it, since you have an immediate @h loser...|
pg||
at| Maybe.. play 2 rounds of @d's to discard the @h loser, then.... no - you are exposed to an overruff.|
pg||
at| Best is to pull 2 rounds of trumps hoping for a 3/2 split. |

pc|SQ|nt|Without that lead, you should play @hK and another @h. But now due to the immediate @s loser, you cannot risk a trump finesse. Your priority is to eliminate the @s losers using the @d's extra winners... You need to assume trumps are 3/2 and that the opponent that has 3 @h's has also at least 3 @d's.   But what should you first do?|pg||
