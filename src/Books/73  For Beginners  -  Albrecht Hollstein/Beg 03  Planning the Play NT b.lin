pg||at| + 1@d|hc|dA|
pg||at| + 2@c|hc|cAK|
pg||at| = 6.|
pg||sb|SHow many tricks are needed to make my bid?|lc|sAhAkdacAK|
pg||at|
To make 3NT we need 9 tricks, so we need 9 - 6 = 3 more.|
pg||at||sb|SWhich suit(s) may provide this additional trick?|
pg||nt|@ss can make 1 additional trick, if LHO leads the suit a second time.
@hs can make 0 additional tricks.
@ds can make at 3-4 additional tricks.
@cs can make at 0 additional tricks.|
pg||nt|So you must establish the @d suit. If the K is with W you have 4 additional tricks if the K is with East only 3.|
pg||sb|SNow let us imagine what will happen, when I try to establish the diamonds.|
pg||nt|1) When you get the lead, you'll play @dJ for the finesse.
2) If the finesse is on, you'll take easy 10 tricks.
3) So let us concentrate, what will happen, if the crucial finesse is off.|
pg||at|
If the finesse is off, East will get the lead and we should plan our play in that way, that 
^*BEAST IS NOT A DANGEROUS OPPONENT^*N.|
pg||sb|SOh I see. East will get the lead, if the finesse is not on.|
pg||sb|sAnd I must try to plan my play so, that HE can do me no harm.|
pg||nt|Correct. The only opponent, who can get the lead is EAST (the crucial finesse goes to him).|
pg||sb|S|pc|s9sQ|
at|
If you take the lead with your @sA, East will be the dangerous opponent, because he can lead a @s through your Jx, when he takes the @dK.
I will show you how this works:|
pg||pc|sa|sk||sb|s|
pg||pc|djdddk|
pg||pc|s8|hs|ss|hc|skst|at|
The @sJ is caught in the fork and West will score 4 more @s tricks.|
pg||sb|SSo I'm lost, if I take the lead with the A of spades?|ls|ss|lc|skst|
pg||nt|Correct. This is a typical example were it is necessary to hold up.
You and dummy have together 5 @s cards. The calculation 7 -5 = 2 shows, that you must hold up twice.|
pg||sb|SI'm interested to get more infos about the rule of 7.|
pg||nt|There is a ^*GLinks,page^*N in this movie with all information you need.
But now let us show, how the hand should be played. |

pg||pc|s9sqs|
pg||pc|s8sjsks|
pg||pc|shss|
pg||pc|djdddk|nt|East got the lead as expected, but has no more @s to lead. 
He isn't dangerous any more, because your hold-up-play exhausted him from that suit.|
pg||sc|y|mc|9|
nt|The decision if you hold up or not should be made while visioning the complete play of the hand.
You should hold up, if it is necessary and the posiible switch to another suit is not dangerous for you.
Look ^*Grules_holdup, here ^*N for more details.|

pg||sb|SThis hand looks very similar to the previous one.|
pg||nt|Yeah, but there is a very important difference. Let us repeat the former analysis:|
pg||sb|SHow many sure tricks do I have?|
pg||nt|Sure tricks are: 1@s|hc|sA|
pg||at| + 2@h|hc|hAK|
pg||at| + 1@d|hc|dA|

pg||sb|SNow let us imagine what will happen, when I try to establish the diamonds.|
pg||nt|1) When you get the lead, you'll goto table play @dQ for the finesse.
2) If the finesse is on, you'll take easy 10 tricks.
3) So let us concentrate, what will happen, if the crucial finesse is off.|
pg||at|
If the finesse is off, West will get the lead and we should plan our play in that way, that 
^*BWest IS NOT A DANGEROUS OPPONENT^*N.|
pg||sb|SOh I see. West will get the lead, if the finesse is not on.|
pg||nt|Correct. The only opponent, who can get the lead is West (the crucial finesse goes to him).|
sb|S|pc|s9sQ|
pg||at|
If you don't take the lead with your @sA, West will be the dangerous opponent, because his suit will be established and ready to cash.
I will show you how this works:|sk||
pg||pc|s2|
pg||pc|s8sjsks|
pg||pc|shss|
pg||pc|hhhkh|
pg||pc|dqdddk|sb|SOuch, West has 2 more spades to cash. I lost 4 spades and 1 diamond for down 1.|
pg||nt|Correct. This is a typical example were it is necessary ^*BNOT^*N to hold up.
Though you and dummy have together 5 @s cards and the rule of 7 tells you to hold up twice.
That is why West is not dangerous, if you take the first trick with @sA.
Let us see how this works.|sb|s|
pg||up|17|nt||
pg||pc|sa|nt|Now West cannot cash his @ss, when he gets the lead, because your @sJ  is another stopper.|hs|ssws|

nt|Now make your plan before you touch a card in dummy!!!!!!!!!!!!|

pg||sb|sOh that's an easy one. Bath-Coup and "9 never"|
pg||nt|You mean to hold up with AJx and hope that West donates you with a second trick in that suit by leading it a second time? This is called the "Bath-Coup".
You learned "With 9 never" to play A and K of a suit with 9 cards and the Q missing.
Ok, take the wheel!!!!!!!!!|
pg||pc|sss|sb|SHere we go|
pg||pc|hjhqhk|sb|SOuch West didn't obey. He switched. grrrr|nt||
pg||pc|h|sb|SI must hold up the hearts too.|
pg||pc|s9sjsqs|sb|s|
pg||pc|hthhh|
pg||pc|hchha|
pg||nt|Now you are in a very uncomfortable situation.
You lost 4 tricks already and are bound to bring in the @ds without loss.

By the way, if you were sure to find the @dQ you had 10 tricks from the top:
1@s + 1@h + 6@d + 2@c = 10|
pg||pc|dkddd|sb|SNo stiff Diamond Q. grrrrrrrr|
pg||pc|dtcddq|sb|SDiamonds are not 2-2 as they should. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr|
pg||pc|hccc|sb|S|
pg||mc|7|nt|And down you are in a foolproof contract.
It was not a good idea to play on old sayings like 
"Always apply the Bath Coup" and "With 9 never"."
You should make your analysis in the 4 steps we learned.|

pg||at| + 1@h|hc|hA|
pg||at| + 2@d|hc|dAk|
pg||at| + 2@c|hc|cAK|

pg||at||sb|SWhich suit(s) may provide this additional trick?|
pg||nt|@ss can make 1 additional trick, if LHO leads the suit a second time.
@hs can make 1 additional trick, if the K is with West or East leads the suit.
@ds can make at 3-4 additional tricks.
@cs can make at 0 additional tricks.|
pg||nt|So you must establish the @d suit. 
If you find the @dQ you have 4 additional tricks, if you lose to the @dQ you'll score only 3 additional tricks.|
pg||sb|SNow let us imagine what will happen, when I try to establish the diamonds.|
pg||nt|If you manage to catch @dQ, you'll take 10 easy tricks. 
But you should concentrate to ensure your contract even if you guess the @dQ wrong.|
pg||at|
There is a very important difference, if you miss the Q instead of the K.|
pg||at|
You can finesse against boths opponents and therefore decide, who will win the trick, if the finesse loses.|

pg||sb|sOh I see. I can finesse in that way, that the losing finesse is won by the NOT dangerous opponent.|
pg||nt|Clap, clap, clap you got it.|
pg||at|
We saw that the hold up will lead to defeat against not sleeping opponents.
Therefore you must take the opening lead with your @sA.|
pg||at|
Now West is NOT dangerous, while East is dangerous (he can lead through your J4).
Therefore you must play the the @ds in a way, that you deny EAST the lead.|
pg||sb|sOK, let me try.|
pg||pc|sssa|
pg||pc|dddad|sb|S|
nt|Now your contract is 100% sure. 
If East had @dQ865 there is nothing you can do about it - you can get only 3 @d tricks or have to give the lead to East.|
pg||pc|dddthj|sb|sOK, now it is plain sailing.|nt||
pg||pc|dhtdd|

^b@2^x@3You should not let you get disturbed by rules and coups and other "good" advices. |
pg||at|
Your aim is ^*Bnot to let the dangerous opponent on lead. ^*N|
pg||at|
There are in principle 2 possibilities to deny the dangerous opponent he lead:|
pg||at|
1) Often you have the choice to make one opponent dangerous or the other. This is important if you have no influence, which opponent gets the lead.|
pg||at|
2) If on the other hand one opponent is dangerous you should try to lose a trick you have to lose to the not dangerous opponent.
|
pg||at|
The ^*Bdangerous^*N opponent either can lead a suit which is established yet or can lead through one of your low honours towards partner's tenace.
|
at|^c@2E.g. in ^*Go1,Example 1^*N East is dangerous if you take the first or second @s trick, but is not dangerous any more if you hold up twice.
|
pg||at|^b@2
The decision of holding up or not must be come from the analysis of the complete hand.|
pg||at|
1) Sure tricks?|pg||at|
2) How many addtional tricks are needed? |pg||at|
3) Which suit(s) can provide these additional tricks?|
pg||at|
4) Imagine, what may happen while you are establishing your additional tricks.|
pg||at|^c@2
4a) How often you'll lose the lead?|pg||at|
4b) Which opponent will gain the lead?|
pg||at|
4c) Which opponent(s) are dangerous?|
pg||at|
4d) Can you prevent a specific opponent to gain the lead?|
pg||at|
4e) Can you manage the play in that way that the opponent, who will get the lead, is not dangerous?
|
pg||at|
^cE.g. in ^*Go1,Example 1^*N the crucial finesse goes into the EAST hand, so you should make him ^*Bnot^*N dangerous by holding up twice.|
