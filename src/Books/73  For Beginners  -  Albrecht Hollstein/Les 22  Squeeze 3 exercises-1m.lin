@ss are distributed 5-3 (I hope. HINT: If the led @s6 was a true card, there is only the 5 higher missing, so West has started with 5 or he fooled you with falsecarding) and if @ds are 2-2, you have 1@s+3@h+6@d+2@c=12 tricks. So let's test the @ds.|pg||

You cannot give up a @d trick, because very probable East has another @s left and the communication is intact.
Ok let's break this communication by playing @s (triggering the suicide squeeze).|pg||

A good defender will visualize the situation early and may discard e.g. the next to last @c earlier and misguide you discarding a @s to this trick.|pg||mc|9|sc|y|pg||
