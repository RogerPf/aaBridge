The play of a suit contract is in general much more complicated than to play a NT-contract. 
To get a better idea you might look up this page:
^*Hwww.albrecht-hollstein.de/Bridge/Lessons/Play a suit contract/How to play Suit-contract summary.htm^*N|
at|

^c@2{This is a general rule in suit-contracts too: Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!! ^z}
|
cs|2|
at|
{^c@2In suit contract we count primarily the number of losers, not the sure tricks. ^z}

{^c@2You get to know the 2 most important ways to avoid a loser:
^d Plan 1: Ruff with dummy's trumps
^d Plan 2: Discard on dummy's long suit. ^z}

{^c@2We confront you with the 2 most common dangers in a suit contract:
^d To suffer a ruff by defenders.
^d To be forced to ruff in the long hand too often. ^z}

{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before playing the first card:
^d 1. How many losers do I have?
^d 2. Are those losers unavoidable or delayed?
^d 3. How can I get rid of some losers?
^d 4. Shall I draw the trumps right away and how many? (to make my bid safely)
^d 5. What may be dangerous for my bid? ^z}

{^c@2The most important decision declarer has to make is if he should draw opponent's trumps at once or if he must postpone this. This will be the topic of the next lesson. ^z}

Reminder: In suit-contracts you count the losers in the master-hand (normally the hand with more trumps).|
pg||at|
Here the master-hand is South.|
pg||at|
South's losers are: 3@s|hc|s975|
pg||at| + 1@d = 4.|hc|d9|
pg||at|
@c7 is not counted as loser because it is covered by the @cK in dummy.|hc|c7ck|

pg||sb|s|up|19|at|
Your plan to ruff a loser in dummy was the correct one. But you should have asked yourself if there was any danger to prevent from. How do you think you can make sure to be able to ruff a @s loser in dummy to make your bid?|
pg||sb|sI need to delay playing on trumps - I cannot afford even a single trump round.|pg||
at|
True. As we saw in the play earlier, you need to give away the lead twice to the opponents. Then, good opponents that see through your ruffing plan will always try to counter you by playing trumps.
Now let's play the hand once more, the correct way.|
pg||sb|sI take the lead in dummy and play a spade.|

How many losers do you have?|
pg||sb|sI see 2 immediate and sure losers - Aces of hearts and clubs.|
pg||sb|sI have also 2 immediate spade losers once they force out the Ace.|
pg||at|
Your analysis is correct. You see that to make your bid you must get rid of at least one spade loser. How could you do this?|
pg||sb|sThe only way is to use my long diamond suit in dummy to discard a spade.|
pg||at|
Do you first play on trumps to avoid a ruff?|
pg||sb|sNot possible. If I play on trumps, I give the lead away and opps will cash 2 quick spade tricks.|
pg||at|
Exactly. Therefore, you know what to do.|
pg||sb|sYes. I play on diamonds right away and hope they are split 4-3.|
pg||at|
The likelyhood of a 4-3 split is a 62% probability, so it is a fair chance.|

Correct! Therefore this looks like an easy contract. What could be dangerous for your bid?|
pg||sb|sThe only danger could come from being greedy and wishing West underlead the spade King.|

Yes. This lead looks very much like a singleton. Not overtaking it with the Ace would be suicidal. Please let's see what could happen from being 'greedy' and start by ducking the lead in dummy...|

pg||nt|A loser on loser play is necessary at trick 2 and it costs nothing.
Try it once more.|
pg||up|24|sb|s|sk|s|
pg||pc|hqhhc|nt|Note that by conceding the 2nd trick you have not lost anything since you always had a club loser anyway. So you played a dummy @h loser on a @c loser in your hand. However the main benefit of this play is that now your nice @s cards in dummy have been freed up or empowered. 
Since it is void of @hs the dummy trumps can stop the forcing. The declarer is back in control as no return can hurt him. He has one more loser, the @dA, but his bid is safe if he plays carefully.|
pg||nt|Remarks: 1) Declarer can ruff the second trick but after 2 rounds of trumps he has to establish the @d, if he gets the bad news that trumps are splitting 4-1.
I prefer to discard the loser on loser at once. Especially with the intermediate trumps in dummy and no danger of an overruff in the 4th round of @h.
2) Observe, that with 4 trumps it would be futile for West to lead his singleton @c. His hand cries for a forcing game.|
pg||sb|wIt is useless to continue the heart suit now. I can only wish for a club winner in West.|
pg||pc|cccQcA|sb|w|
pg||sb|sI will now test the spade suit - hoping at worst for a 4-1 split.|pc|SssQs|
pg||pc|Scss|sb|sSpades are 4-1. So I can pull trumps safely.|

How many losers?|
pg||sb|s3 inescapable losers: 2 spades and 1 diamond, also a delayer heart loser.|
pg||at|
You cannot do anything for the @ss and @d losers. This leaves the delayed @h loser. What can be done to get rid of it? But first, tell me what you think of the lead.|
pg||sb|sWest found a great lead since it removes one of the 2 heart stoppers. I can't play on trumps...|
pg||sb|swithout losing the lead twice, and a heart continuation (logical) would be fatal.|
pg||sb|sSo, there is no future in playing on trumps.|
pg||at|
Good analysis. This hand is about judging the "timing". The heart lead is indeed very bad for the declarer. With any other lead you could afford to play on trumps, with 2 stoppers protecting the delayed heart loser. But following the @h lead, you need 'urgently' to find a discard for this small @h loser. What is your plan?|
pg||sb|sThe club suit will provide a discard but I am afraid of a ruff. So it leaves the diamond suit.|
pg||nt|Correct. The diamond suit is the correct choice as you only need to lose the lead once to the @dA to set-up the suit for a discard while your heart loser is still protected by your last stopper.  Now that you have a plan, show us the play.|
pg||pc|HhhA|sb|sThe priority is to set-up the diamonds for a heart discard.|
