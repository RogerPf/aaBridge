^-{Positional vs Automatic vs Pseudo squeezes}
^-|pg||

cs||
cp|1|
at|
A positional squeeze is one that works because the key defender has to discard first, before the hand that contains the two threats. Board 1 is an example of such a squeeze.

|pg||

at|A squeeze is called 'automatic', when it will work against either defender.

|pg||

at|And a pseudo-squeeze: This is not actually a mechanical squeeze, but rather a psychological squeeze play intended to induce a wrong discard by a defender, who is under the false impression that he has been squeezed.

^-|pg||
cs||
cp|1|
at|
In general, a defender cannot be squeezed unless all his cards are 'busy', guarding against some threat or other. If he has a spare card somewhere he will simply discard that instead, retaining all his guards. To make sure that the key defender's cards are all busy, you should aim to lose at an early stage all those tricks that you can afford to lose.

|pg||

at|In a small slam, for example, you should aim to lose one early trick. In a major-suit game you should aim to lose three tricks. Each time you lose such a trick you will remove one idle card from the defender's hand. This technique - deliberately losing one or more tricks to tighten the end position - is known as rectifying the count. This lesson includes several hands that illustrate the use of this key technique.

|pg||

at|And last, with the help of an hand diagram, we will review the meaning of card threat or menace and of squeeze card.|pg||

nt|Let's look at the end position in a typical simple squeeze:|pg||at| South is the declarer and these are his weapons:|
pg||at|
a one-card threat (menace) (the @cJ)
a two-card threat (the @ssAJ)
the squeeze card (the @h5)|
pg||nt|West, the only defender who can influence the outcome, has two items in his armory:
a guard against the one-card threat (the @cQ)
a guard against the two-card threat (the @ssKQ).|
pg||
wt|s|pc|H5|
at| When the squeeze card is led, West has to discard one of his guards. If he throws the @cQ, declarer will throw the @sJ from dummy and score the last two tricks with the @sA and the established @cJ.|
pg||
nt|If instead West throws one of his @s honours, declarer will throw the @cJ and make two @s tricks.|
pg||
at| NOTE: Nearly all squeezes require there to be a one-card threat and a two-card threat that includes an entry (here the @sA). Why is this entry necessary?!|
pg||
at| Because otherwise the defender could safely abandon one of his guards and you would not be able to reach the threat card that had become established.|
at| Now let's move on to the actual lesson's hands...|

nt|Simple positional squeeze. You have 12 tricks and the other trick cannot be in @ss or @cs. A squeeze is possible if West in addition to the @HQ, holds also 4 or more @ds. It is positional because the squeeze will work only with one specific opponent (West).|
