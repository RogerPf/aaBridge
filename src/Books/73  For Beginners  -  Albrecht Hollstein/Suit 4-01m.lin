nt|Now you were right to ruff the 3rd @s. You can see 2 @c losers but your @d's extra winners will take care of them. What should really be a concern to you?|
pg||
at| Right! The trump distribution being most likely 4-2 (probability is 49%). How should you handle this?|
pg||
at| Have you thought of leading the @h 10!!!!!!!. Now you are making your contract 100% safe if hearts are 3/3 or 4/2. 4 @h's + 4 @d's + 2 @c's give you your contract. 
|pg||
nt|Playing a low trump protected you against a @s return as you still had a @h stopper in dummy. 
In MP you must play safe too. You found a good 5/2 fit, what no everyone does. So just try to win. Don't care about overtricks.|pg||

at| and now you have a choice: ruff or duck?|pg||
nt|Think twice before ruffing this time. The double by West is a warning sign that the trumps distribution could be 4-1 or 5-0. Think about how you could protect yourself against such a bad distribution.|
pg||
at| Right! Since you have an unavoidable @h loser, just discard a low @h.|
pg||
pc|H5|
nt|Assuming a good @c split you have your 10 tricks. Therefore there is no need to ruff the 3rd diamond. Most of the time the mistake will go over unnoticed. But if spades are 5/0 there is punishment.|pg||

nt|What card do you play?|pg||
at| If the contract is 5@s, it would be right to duck the trump lead, hoping spades are 3/2. But here the loss of three trump tricks doesn't matter. Take the @sA and play on @ds to ensure your contract. If you duck, West can lead @h, forcing you to ruff later and lose trump control.|

nt|Make the plan.|pg||
at| You have 2 or 3 losers in @h, 1 sure loser in @s and 2 losers in @D that can be ruffed. To prevent over ruff, you need to play trumps, but be careful: you must play exactly 2 rounds. Therefore you must lead the 1st round of trumps from the hand against the @hQ. Later take your Ace. If you play @hA and then small to the @hQ, LHO might take his @hK, play the 3rd round of trumps and you are 1 trick short.|pg||

nt|What is your plan?|pg||
at| You have 2 losers in trumps and two in @d. One @D loser can be ruffed, but there is a danger that opponents can draw all trumps from dummy when they gain lead again.|pg||
nt|Now count your possible winners: A and K in @S + @DA + A, K and Q in @C + @hA and 3 ruffs in hand makes 10. So, duck the lead, keeping trump control (because you want to draw EXACTLY 2 rounds of trumps) and play a partial dummy reversal, ruffing in your hand 3 times. If West overruffs, dummy's @h8 will be the 10th trick.|pg||

nt|You shouldn't worry if 3NT is better contract - it isn't, as 3NT is doomed on the probable heart lead. So, make your plan for the contract bid: 4@S.|pg||
nt|Count your tricks: @HA + A, K and Q in @D + K, Q and J in @C + 3 or 4 @s makes 10 or 11 tricks. But beware: if @ss are 4/2 as they likely are, your contract will be in danger if you take the losing spade finesse. Play A and K of @S, then Clubs and lose @CA and 2 trumps.
Note: If you lose the spade finesse you will allow the opps to play the forcing game. Playing on @hs they will make you lose trump control. Do not let them!|pg||
