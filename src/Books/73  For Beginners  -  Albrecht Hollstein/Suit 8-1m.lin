at| Prospects are good: 75% that one finesse is right, but you can do better. Have you noticed the @c9?|pg||

nt|If the finesse were on (WEST has @dQ) he would be endplayed (50% probability).
Now East is partially endplayed. He must play @c, else you have a ruff and sluff. You win if East had 1 of the club honors (Q or 10) and that is 75%.|pg||
pc|C4|pc|C3|pc|CQ|pc|CA|pg||
at| Your play had a total chance of 87.5%:

pg||
at| Considering the @h bid by West, you should think of an endplay. You found your exit card: the @h2. Now let's hope for a good trump split 2-2....|

You cannot draw all trumps, else you have no endplay. The main thing is that West does not have any more trumps (he could then exit in trump). You will therefore assume that the remaining trump is with East.
