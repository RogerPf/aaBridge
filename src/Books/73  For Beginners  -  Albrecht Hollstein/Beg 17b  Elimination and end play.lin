^b@2This board 3 of lesson(17) which I lifted out of it because it made me aware of some things I took for granted in my previous review of lesson 16. I wrote this.
"1. ^ctake as soon as possible a trick
 2. ^cdraw trumps
 3. ^celiminate sidesuits
 4. ^cforce an opponent to the lead."
After you have forced the opponent to the lead you have to keep your original declarer-plan in mind to succesfully finish your end-play!

nt|You have 3 losers, 2 in clubs and 1 in hearts. (You count your losers in the masterhand. Now south because here are 5 trumps opposite 4 in north.
If you cash the @dK and @dA you should be able to ruff (take a trick with a trump because you have not any card in that suit.) on table (in dummy).
That leaves you with the two club losers.|pg||nt||hs|nc|at|You could try to develop the long club suit in dummy but opponents will take @cK and @cQ before you can enjoy your free clubs. So this can not be right.|pg||ls|nc|lc|d3|at|
You could try a second plan. Trying to take a double finesse from north by playing @c2 to the @cJ10. This would go right if the @cK and @cQ would ^*bnot^*n be in the same hand.(75%)
You would have entries enough in dummy to make this plan feasable.|pg||nt||
at|Lets assume the worst. Both are with West. Could you now think of a declarerplan that could succeed?|pg||lc|cjt|at| Endplay, Elimination, Throw-in are terms that come to mind. 
Do we have trumps enough? (In the final stage of the endplay you should have left at least one trump in dummy and one in hand.)|pg||hs|nh|nt||
at|To elimenate the @d's you have to use a trump in dummy; to eliminate the @s's you use a trump in hand.|pg||at|
Since there are 4 hearts in dummy you can afford to draw 2 rounds of trumps. Needing 1 for the @d-ruff that would leave the one needed trump in dummy.|pg||at| So the first part of declarerplan is ready. Take the lead with @dA and draw two rounds of trump|pg||pc|dad6d|pg||pc|hhhah|pg||pc|hkhhh|at| No trumps anymore with opps. (and one left in hand and one in dummy after the @d-ruff.)|pg||nt||at|Let's consider the second part of the plan. How will we do the elimination.|pg||at| Since you want to play a small club from north to force west to the lead you have to end the elimination in North. 
That is possible when you start with eliminating the spades and then the diamonds.|pg||pc|sssas|pg||pc|sksss|pg||pc|ssh8s|pg||at| And now the diamonds..|pc|dkddd|pg||pc|ddh7d|pg||ls|nh|at| And now we have ended in dummy we can throw-in West with a club.. let's go!|pg||pc|cccck|pg||at| West could have refused to play the @cKing but then your contract would have been made anyway. West leads @sJ|pc|sj|

at|And now comes the part where i thought i could go on automatic thinking. 
Ruff and sluff Al said... |pc|csht|pg||at| Oops or something like that Al said..|pg||at| because you are down, loosing a club to the @cQ. Al said: "there is a rule for this situation: ruff in the long (@c) hand and sluff in the short (@c) hand."
|pg||at| But as i said before: remembering rules stresses my poor memory. "Do I really need a rule here?" so I asked myself.|pg||nt||
at|I do not think so.. lets turn this 1 trick back|pg||up|3|at| and refer to the first beginning of our declarer-plan.. |pg||at| we needed to get rid of three losers in the masterhand. |pg||at|Only the @cJ remains so take that chance now|pg||hc|hj|at|
Quite obvious now to play the @hJ in dummy to get rid of that last losing Club in hand..|pg||pc|hsc|pg||at|And now you can not help it to take all the remaining tricks.. Your happy reviewer
