at|Losers: 1 in @S (unavoidable), 1 in @h, 2 in @d
|pg||
at|Yes. You could try the 50% @h finesse. But is there a 100% plan ?
|pg||
at|It appears that you cannot ruff any @d loser in dummy because the suit is 3-3. Any idea how you could use the @h suit which is 3-2 ?
|pg||
nt|Right! Concede a @h trick immediately. You win any return and play your 2 @h tricks, discarding a @d in dummy on the last @h round. You are now ready to execute the 2nd step of your plan 1 which will allow you to ruff your 3rd @d in dummy. 
|pg||
at|Can you play trump first? No. Because the opponents will take away your @d stopper and you will not be able to avoid 2 @d losers anymore.|

|pg||
at|Yes. You could hope for East to have a doubleton @sKx. But if it fails, you will not avoid 2 @c losers and your contract will fail. Take the safe road and implement a plan 1 by using dummy shortness to ruff a @c loser.|pg||

|pg||
at|Plan to set-up the @c suit. There is a 62% probability that the suit will break 4-3. You could always resort back to the finesse as a back-up plan.
|pg||
at|Your plan would also work if clubs are 5-2 with a doubleton @cQx. A 9% probability + 62% = overall 71% chance of success.|

Don't finesse the @dQ. You must be afraid of a @h-switch.
Establish the @c-suit. 36% for a 3-3 split + 48% for a 4-2 split = 84%.

nt|Hook the @dJ!!!!. 
You have loser potential in each suit. Contract depends on finding solution to getting quickly 2 @d tricks so you can discard a @c loser without delay.... If you play trump, the opponents will play a 2nd round of @c to promote a trick in that suit...|pg||
nt|Right solution: With the shortage of entries to the dummy, you can lead only once towards the closed hand before losing the lead. Therefore playing East for the A@d is a non-starter and your only hope is that he has the @DJ (assumption of necessity).
Therefore you should win the lead in dummy and pass the @d10.|pg||
nt|Note that it is not good enough to win in hand and lead the @dK, intending to unblock the @d10 and finesse against the @dJ on the secound round. West will allow the @dK to hold. Now you cannot continue diamonds and, if you play trumps, East will win and continue clubs; the defenders are a move ahead.|pg||
