{^c@2In this lesson we shall see a variant of Plan 3, the elimination play: 
It is described as the situation in which an opponent has to choose between 
leading towards a tenace or conceding a ruff and discard.  ^z}
|
cs|2|pg||at|
{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt an elimination play:
^d1. Do I have a problem suit where I have to make a guess or where leading the suit (breaking it) may cost a trick?
^d2. Do I have enough trumps in both hands to make a ruff and sluff possible?
^d3. Is it possible to eliminate the side suits?
^d4. How will I put a defender on lead? ^z|
pg||at|
{^c@2Most elimination plays rely on a tenace in some suit. Often it is a holding which will benefit from a lead by an opponent. 
Let's see some examples:
^d1. Qxx  Jxx One trick is certain if suit is lead by an opponent.
^d2. AQT  xxx Two tricks are certain if neither opponent has a safe exit.
^d3.  AJx  KTx Three tricks are certain. ^z

{There are a lot of suit combinations, which you should avoid to lead yourself, but try to induce an opponent to do so:
AJx - K10x;   AJx - K9x;    A10x - K9x;   A9x -Q8x; A10x - Jxx;   Qxx - K109;   Q9x - K8x;    Jxx - Kxx;    Jxx - Qxx}|Pg||

To execute an endplays follow three steps:|pg||
At|
1) Eliminate all the side-suits.|pg||
At|
2) Throw the opponent in.|pg||
At|
   a) In a side suit, in which you and dummy (or defender) have no more cards|pg||
At|
   b) with help of an loser on loser play|pg||

   c) with one of magic combinations AQ10, AQ9 ....|pg||

3) Wait for opponent to open your critical suit or give you a ruff and sluff.|pg||
