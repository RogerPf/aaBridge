pc|HJ|nt|We play always on 'split honors' in this situation, except if there are strong reasons to believe that West has both honors. Strong reasons may be: opponents have bid and the HCP-count shows that one opponent must have both honors. Or if an unexperienced player plays an honor. But here there are not any strong reasons, so we go on and play for split honors.|pg||pc|HK|pc|H4|pc|H2|pg||
pc|HT|pc|H5|pc|H3|pc|H6|mc|12|sk||
nt|Note on play for split honors: If opponent plays low you must play low from table and cannot win if the other has both honors. But you win 100% if the one who led has them both. Therefore with 2 honors the defender must play one. This knows and do even weak players. BUT a good player, who sees that he is endplayed will play his honor from Hx and Hxx.|
