nt|Count your tricks: 3@s + 2@h + 2@d + 5@c = 12 tricks. The 13th may come from 3-3 @s distribution or a squeeze, so pay attention to the distribution, having in mind the auction, too.|pg||

nt|Spades are not distributed 3-3 but now you know that East started with 1 @s, 6 @hs (2@h bid) and at least 2@cs, probably 3 if his signals (low-high) in @c are true, leaving 3 cards in @d. West initialy had 5 @ss, 1 @h and probably 4 @ds and 3 @cs. Now East is left with 0=5=3=1 and West with 4=0=4=1. The situation is perfect for a double simultaneous squeeze: both opponents in a shared suit (here @d), and each of them in a second, separate suit (East in @h, West in @s).|pg||
pc|SQ|pc|S6|pg||
nt|For double squeeze you need: a squeeze card, a double menace and two isolated menaces guarded by only one opponent. Here you can take 4 Aces and Q7 in @c are high so each opponent will have to choose what two cards will keep at the end.|pg||
pc|HA|
at| Cash the @hA first (Coup Vienna).|pg||

nt|You have 1 sure loser in trums, 2 in @ss and one in @c. East opened 1NT, so you know he must have all the 17 outstanding HCPs. The club finesse is out, but maybe you can endplay him? That is often possible, when one defender has all the HCPs.|pg||

nt|East cashes his tricks, so there is no chance of an endplay. So you must execute a squeeze in minors.|pg||

nt|This move is called the "Coup Vienna". It is an unblocking play. You need the @c10 in your hand for this play: you have 2-cards menace (@D AQ), 1-card menace (@c10) and a squeeze card (@h).

nt|You have 11 top tricks. The chance for 12th is the favourable 3-3 distribution in @h or @s or simple positional squeeze (West's lead indicates the length in @d so East probably has length in both majors). Hold up the lead to rectify the count.|pg||
