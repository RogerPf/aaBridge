* The plan for a NT contract consists of the following steps:
^d@21. Count your sure tricks in high cards.
2. Calculate how many additional tricks are needed to make your bid.
3. Decide from which suit these tricks may come from.
4. Be aware what can damage your plan.
    4.1 Can opponents do me any harm?
    4.2 Is there a dangerous opponent?
    4.3 Are there enough entries to my long suit (either in dummy or in my hand)
    4.4 Is there a danger to block suits?
    4.5 What do I discard, when a long suit is played?

^d(transportation).

mb|pp1np3nppp|nt||
pc|sk|nt|You made your plan:
1. How many sure tricks do I have?|pg||
at| 1@s + 2@h + 2@d = 5
|pg||

at| 9 - 5 = 4

at| @c
|pg||
at|There is one more question to ask: What damage can be done by defenders?|pg||
sb|SWhat damage can be done by defenders?|pg||
nt|Defenders can cash 4@s tricks along with the @cA.|pg||
at||sb|SHow can I prevent this?|pg||
nt|There are 13 @s-cards in the deck. You and dummy own 6 of them.
So defenders have got 7 @ss. These can be distributed 7-0, 6-1, 5-2 or 4-3.|pg||
nt|Let us assume that West has led from a long @s-suit (4, 5, 6 or 7 cards).
There is no problem if the distribution is 4-3. They can only cash 4 tricks (3@s and @cA).
If @s are 7-0 or 6-1 and the @cA is with East, he cannot reach West to give him the lead to cash his high @ss.
The only critical situation is a 5-2 distribution with East holding @cA and exactly 2 @ss.|pg||
at||sb|SOhhhhhhhhhh, I guess I got it!|pg||sb|SI have to refuse the first trick and destroy defenders transportation.|pg||
pc|sss|nt|Clap, clap, clap, you executed a HOLD-UP PLAY.|sb|S|pg||
pc|sQsssA|pg||
pc|cKccc|at|
Defenders are allowed to hold-up too LOL.|pg||
pc|cQccc|nt|Now the contract is safe as long as West holds the longer @s-suit.
If East has got another @s, that means the suit is distributed 4-3 and defenders make only 3 @s-tricks.
And if the suit is distributed 5-2, East has no other @s to return.|pg||

pc|s|sb|SOuch, East has a spade left!|pg||
nt|And down goes the contract, when defenders scored @cA and 4 @s-tricks.|sk||mc|8|pg||
cs|y|nt|The hand isn't identical to the first example! This time you hold only 5 cards in the @s-suit, so the possible distributions are 8-0, 7-1, 6-2, 5-3 and 4-4.|sb|S|pg||
at|
The critical distributions are now 6-2 and 5-3.|pg||
at|
Holding-up once guarded against 6-2, but not against 5-3 distribution.|pg||

If the short hand holds 3 cards, it is necessary to hold up twice.|pg||

mb|1dx2cp2np3nppp|
nt|Here is another example.|pc|h7|pg||
at| Declarer "counts" his tricks:
2@h + 2@d + 6@c = 10
The defenders can only cash the 2 red Aces, @sA and @sK, so 9-10 tricks should be made.|pg||at||

sk||up|52|nt|This is what happened:
Declarer mixed up "sure" tricks with "potential" tricks. After the first trick declarer had 1@h+6@c=7 sure tricks and 3 more "potential" tricks in the red suits.
He must promote these tricks by driving out the red Aces BEFORE he cashes his long @cs.|pg||

rh||ah|Example 3|ah|9 tricks is enough|pg||
pc|hhh|
pg||pc|dkddd|nt|Good hold-up play by opponent.|
pg||pc|dqdadd|at|
Now declarer has 1@h+2@d+6@c=9 sure tricks.
Opponents can cash at most 2 red Aces and @sA and K.
So you can claim 9 tricks at once or wait for a defensive slip (maybe they present you with a 10th trick LOL).|
