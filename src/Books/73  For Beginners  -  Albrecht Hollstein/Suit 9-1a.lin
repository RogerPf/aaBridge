at|@4There are a lot of suit combinations, which you should avoid to lead yourself, but try to induce an opponent to do so:
AJx - K10x;   AJx - K9x;    A10x - K9x;   A9x -Q8x; 
A10x - Jxx;   Qxx - K109;   Q9x - K8x;    Jxx - Kxx;
Jxx - Qxx|Pg||
At|

To execute an endplays follow three steps:|pg||
At|
1) Eliminate all the side-suits.|pg||
At|
2) Throw the opponent in.|pg||
At|
   a) In a side suit, in which you and dummy (or defender) have no more cards|pg||
At|
   b) with help of an loser on loser play|pg||
At|
   c) with one of magic combinations AQ10, AQ9 ....|pg||
At|
3) Wait for opponent to open your critical suit or give you a ruff and sluff.|pg||

nt|Easy contract if @dK is on side, but should you risk your contract on a finesse?|
pg||
at| Never, when there is a no-cost alternative. You learned from the lead that West has the @sQ. So you know how to end-play West. Have you noted something peculiar about this hand?|

nt|Now do you exit to West with a @s, hoping he had only 2 @c cards (unlikely) or do you risk exiting with a @c and have East take over the trick?|
pg||
at| Exiting with a @c is the correct choice. Because you have the @dA, you can take the next trick and then complete your endplay by playing a @s to West @sQ.|
