at|1@h + 2@c+ 1@D = 4.
|pg||
at|How could you eliminate one loser - let's plan...
|pg||
at|It is not possible to ruff any losers - so what else could you try?
|pg||
at|You have a long suit in dummy(@d). If you establish the suit, you could then use the set-up trick to discard a loser in declarer's hand. This is known as a Plan 2. Is it doable?
|pg||
nt|What is required for this plan to work?
|pg||
at|First, you need the @d N/S distribution to be either 3-3 (36%) or 4-2 (48%), for a total of 84%.
|pg||
at|Second, you need to be able to play the suit 5 times if the distribution is 4-2.
|pg||
at|But hold on, there is a problem, you need 4 entries to dummy and you have only 3. Is your plan doomed?
|pg||
nt|When short of an entry, a solution should come to mind, a duck from both hands in the suit you wish to set-up, also known as "Coup en Blanc".
|pg||
at|Now, let's play the hand as planned. The key is not to delay making your 'Coup en Blanc'. You cannot afford to play even one round of trumps, because the opps could make a trump return and you would lose an entry to dummy...

nt|Stop - let's count losers and make a plan:
|pg||
at|You see 4 losers, 1 in @s, 2 in @d, 1 in @c.
|pg||
at|Can you eliminate some losers somehow?
|pg||
at|It is not possible to ruff anything in short side with 3-3 distribution.|pg||
at|  and the only possibily to make a 2nd @d trick is....|pg||
at| to find a big honor singleton with East or KQ in East or West. Very unlikely.
|pg||
nt|Therefore, the only potential left is to try setting-up the long weak suit in dummy (@c) to discard a loser in declarer's hand. 
The plan is doable with a 4-3 E/W distribution (probability of 62%).
|pg||
at|Do you have enough entries? You need to play @c five times. Therefore you need 4 entries to dummy. And luckily you have them.|pg||
