This is a high percentage play, about 60%.
It will be successful whenever East has the @dQ and distribution is not worst than 4-2.
It will also work when West has the @dQ and distribution is 3-3.

On the next 4 pages you find various 4-2 distributions of the @ds in the East-West hands.
Try the finesse in contrast to the double expass and recognize, that the finesse never provides|

Your initial plan was incomplete. In addition to playing for a 3-2 split (68%) you should have also planned for @dJxxx with West and unblock the @dT just in case. If East had started with @dJxxx it is still the percentage play to play the Queen on 2nd @d trick.|
