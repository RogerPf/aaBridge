The play of a suit contract is in general much more complicated than to play a NT-contract. 
To get a better idea you might look up this page:
^*Hwww.albrecht-hollstein.de/Bridge/Lessons/Play a suit contract/How to play Suit-contract summary.htm^*N|
at|

^c@2{This is a general rule in suit-contracts too: Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!! ^z}
|
cs|2|
at|
{^c@2In a suit contract we count primarily the number of losers, not the sure tricks. ^z}|
cs|8|
at|

{^c@2The two most important ways to avoid losers are:
^d Plan 1: Ruff with dummy's trumps.
^d Plan 2: Discard on dummy's long suit.
{^c@2In this lesson we shall see some variations of Plan 2: Discard losers on dummy's long suit. }|
cs|2|
at|

{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt Plan 2:
^d1. Is dummy's suit established or not?
^d2. Are those losers unavoidable or delayed?
^d3. Is there a dangerous opponent?
^d4. Are there enough entries? Do I need dummy's trumps as entries?}|
cs|8|
at|

{^c@2The most important decision declarer has to make is: to draw opponent's trumps at once or postpone it.
There are 3 reasons to postpone:
^d1. You need dummy's trumps to ruff losers in your hand.
^d2. You need dummy's trumps as entries later.
^d3. You need dummy's trumps to be guarded against a ^*Bforcing game.^*N}

Reminder: In suit-contracts you count the losers in the master-hand (normally the hand with more trumps).|
pg||at|
The master-hand here is South.|
pg||at|
South's losers are: 1@s |hc|s4|
pg||at| + 2@d|hc|d36|
pg||at| + 1@c = 4.|hc|c7|
pg||nt|Prospects seem bad: There is no shortness in dummy to ruff (except trumps LOL).
There are no lower honors or intermediates to try for a finesse or endplay.|lc|s4d36c7|
pg||at|
We can count the winners: 2@s+6@h+1@d=9 with the same result:
We are a trick short.|hc|sakda|hs|sh|
pg||at|
Seems there is no chance at all. |lc|sakda|ls|sh|
sb|sWait a moment. What about these nice little clubs in dummy?|hs|nc|pg||
nt|Yeah, you are right: The @c suit in dummy is a long suit. 
If the opponents @cs are distributed 4-3, you can establish an additional trick.

Go for it.|sb|s|
pg||sb|SWhat about entries to dummy's hand?|
pg||nt|You have 2@s+2@h+1@d=5 entries to the table. That is enough since you will lose the lead 4 times to set-up the @c suit. The last entry will allow you to use the last @c in dummy for a discard.|sb|s|
pg||sb|SDo I draw the trumps first?|
pg||nt|NOPE ..........................................It is needed as an entry to dummy.|sb|s|
pg||pc|hhh|sb|sWe attack clubs right away.|
pg||pc|cccc|

South with the longer trump suit is obviously the master-hand.|
pg||at|
How many losers do you have?|
pg||sb|s1 heart (if the break is fair) + 2 spades + 2 diamonds = 5.|hc|h2s63dq9|
pg||at|
The @s lead is unlucky. Why?|lc|h2s63dq9|
pg||sb|sBecause we are faced with 4 quick losers.|
pg||at|
How can we avoid at least one loser?|
pg||sb|sOn extra winners in the club suit.|
pg||at|
Exactly. But first you need to consider the danger of a ruff. Do you play on trumps and how many rounds if you do?|
pg||sb|sWe play exactly 2 rounds. Hoping for a 3-2 split.|
pg||at|
Correct. And what do we hope for to make our bid?|
pg||sb|sThat the opp holding the last trump also has at least 2 club cards.|
pg||nt|In effect, you hope that the opps will be forced to ruff a @s loser, the one that will be discarded on the 3rd club..... 
Let's execute the plan... 
First hold up the lead just in case opponent cannot read partner's signal and misdefends.|
pg||pc|sss|sb|s|
pg||pc|sqsass|at||sb|sHmhh, didn't work.|
pg||pc|hhhkh|sb|sI can't afford to clear the trumps without losing the lead.|
pg||sb|sSo I play only 2 rounds...|
pc|hahhh|
pg||pc|cccc|sb|sI now wish to be able to play 2 club tricks without a ruff.|
pg||pc|cccac|sb|sNow the defense cannot harm me as I discard at least 1 loser.|

Again South has more trumps and is the master-hand. How many losers?|
pg||sb|s3 spades + 1 heart + 2 clubs = 6.|hc|h3SK63c82|
pg||at|
How can you get rid of 3 losers?|lc|h3Sk63c82|
pg||sb|sWe could easily ruff the 3rd spade and club losers.|
pg||at|
But there is a better option. Which one?|
pg||sb|sTake advantage of the extra winners in diamonds.|
pg||at|
Is there a danger we should try to protect against?|
pg||sb|sYes. East is our dangerous opp since he can lead through our spade weakness.|
pg||sb|sWe must do everything to avoid giving the lead to East.|
pg||at|
How could East take the lead?|
pg||sb|sEither with a club or with the heart Queen.|
pg||at|
How can you avoid giving up the lead in the club suit?|
pg||sb|sI will hold up one round.|
pg||at|
And for the @hQ?|
pg||sb|sEasy.:) I will make the finesse into the safe hand West.|

Good. Is there any danger you should try to protect against?|

Excellent! Now when you are aware of the danger, how can you guard against?|

pg||sb|s|pc|hqhhh|
pg||pc|hhkhah|
pg||pc|h|sb|SWell done, opponents. Sorry partner, bad luck, really!|
pg||nt|Nope... not bad luck, it was bad plan... or better to say, incomplete plan. You didn't consider the possibility of East having QJx in clubs.|
pg||sb|SOh, I see. Let me try again!|
pg||up|24|at|
OK, but what is the plan?|
pg||sb|SI will fool East, watch!|
pg||at||pc|ddd|
pg||pc|s2s5s8s4|
pg||pc|c3cJ|sb|SOh no! Why East doesn't play low hoping for West to hold the 10?|
pg||at|
That would be bad play. East must play honour promoting his other honour in the suit. 
So, hoping for opponents to make a mistake is not a good plan. Any other idea?|
pg||sb|SI give up. Please give me a hint.|
pg||up|9|nt|Of course. Tell me, would it be easier for you if you can rid of one club, remaining with only two?|
pg||sb|SSure, then I can ruff East's high club!|
pg||at|
So....| 
pg||sb|SBut how? I can use only a diamond J, but East can have the Q!|
pg||at|
Another hint: What is the lead?|
pg||sb|SYes! West's K promises the Q, so I can play the J safely!|
at|
Fine... Now, the next step in the plan: do you have enough entries to the table?|
pg||sb|SI need 3 entries to establish clubs and 1 more to enjoy them.|
pg||sb|SI can use 3 trumps and the club K, so I have enough.|
pg||at|
What does it mean, should you draw trumps and if yes, how many?|
pg||sb|sI must play trumps only for entries.|
pg||sb|s|at|
Now, that is ^*BThe Plan^*N! Let's see if it is the good one.|

nt|Well done!
This was the variation of "Loser on loser" play called the ^*BScissors coup^*N (you cut the communication of defenders).
Additional note: observe that drawing trumps at the beginning would be disastrous.|
