pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|Harmon: Steffy here wanting to drink|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|Vugraphzfc: 3H required a 4H bid with 3 trumps|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Some work here in 3NT|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


pc|c9|nt|jkdood: The nice layout in hearts should see the contract home|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|Vugraphzfc: @h's fortuitously onside . . .|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|jkdood: Although South's 76 are big spots|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: 3@H was COG that REQUIRES 4@H with 3-fit  1N-2@D-3N is COG that lets opener decide what to do with 3-fit|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: COG = Choice Of Game|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|jkdood: 4@C 3@H 1@S 1@D for 9 tricks should not be that hard|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|Harmon: rusinow leads|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|jkdood: Once South gets his "spot-rich" heart trick, then the count is up to 4@H for declarer|

pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|d6|pc|cK|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|jkdood: (Many specs are saying  4@H 4@H will score :-)|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|jkdood: Rusinow leads basically mean lower of touching honors for those that are asking|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|jkdood: This line of play is  a bit surprising indeed|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|jkdood: Bramley may be forced to find QJ@H both on side now|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


pc|d3|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|jkdood: I am sure that was not his objective|

pc|h2|pc|s6|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|Vugraphzfc: Has to double hook @h's?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|jkdood: SHouldn t Balicki win that and play a @D for best defense?|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: looking at BZ convention card   @C9 vs NT = 109x(x)   from H109 the lead is 10    so not really Rusinow|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|d7|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: most of their spot card leads will be 2nd/4th   just wasn't sure if that went up to 9|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|jkdood: I think Balicki's failure to win and play a @D will be an 11 imp mis-step of sorts|

pc|d3|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|rick3son:  most of the time leading an unsupported ace is not first choice, but were not many good options|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|meargent: i think 3NT would have been easier|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|chip: Yes, defense has made declarer's task rather easy.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|meargent: too much science|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|pmasson:  Eaast might have bid 3NT over 3@H|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|chip: true, good clubs, but rest of hand is not so great.  |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|Vugraphzfb: East thought a long time over 3@c, presumably thinking about that|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|rick3son:  Meckstroth and Rodwell are fondly referred to as "Meckwell" a contraction of there names and their bidding system notes that numbers into the hundreds of pages|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|rick3son:  the West player is Mike Passell, often called Big Mike|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|rick3son:  he is a man of 2 meters height|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|Vugraphzfb: We're having a very short break here, because Meckstroth had to go to the bathroom - he took a kibitzer with him to avoid any security issues|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |

pg| ***** 79 ***** |


mb|p|nt|Harmon: sort of|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 11-18|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


mb|3D|nt|Harmon: he went to pin 8 of s|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|jkdood: So a push board, maybe there was a better line, and we move on|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it didn't take me long to realize that if i don't understand Bramley's line of play -- it is because i'm too slow|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|jkdood: LOL AL|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|jkdood: North should surely raise here|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|jkdood: (Thinking about 3N?)|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: meckwell strong 1@C auction to 3N north|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|jkdood: 3N failed, so a chance for Lynch team if this can somehow come home|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|jkdood: The club layout is of course NOT what South needs|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat favorable preempt -- Balicki can't make ANY assumptions about location of @C honors|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |

pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: but now just based on west shortness in both majors -- he will suspect he's in trouble|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


pc|sQ|nt|jkdood: Bramley may break up the position with a club through|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|s8|

nt|jkdood: Its sort of a squeeze endplay, but seems remote|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|jkdood: Entries are also an issue for all these postions|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: if you've read Clyde Love's Bridge Squeezes Complete = that is a problem with the E portion of BLUE|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: if you haven't read Love's book -- WHY NOT?|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|jkdood: 3N probably was a better spot, but this is interesting spot as well|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


pc|s6|pc|d4|pc|c4|pc|sT|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|jkdood: I have some specs betting fo a plus, anyone a gambler want that action?|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


pc|c8|nt|Harmon: aplus for ew|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: there's actually an interactive program now based on Love's book|

pg| ***** 119 ***** |


mc|8|nt|jkdood: He could have ruffed a dime and exited a club for the endplay for down 1, to be fair, Al :)|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: the interactive program is called  Bridge Squeezes Complete|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|Vugraphzfc: Bal criticizing Z for going down an extra trick with all hands counted out|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |

pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|rick3son:  thanks Phil|

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F1|mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rick3son:  How many kibitzers are ther tonight at the table there in playing site?|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|pmasson:  Good question...this is the closed room though|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|meargent: unlike the USA where most master point leaders are players of ability in canada most of are cleading masterpoint holders have never won an important event what that proves about ...|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|meargent: masterpoints i guess is dependent on if one lives north or south of the boarder|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|djneill:  hi all|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt|chip: Both 3N and 4S rate to fail with bad S split and both finesses losing. Though 4S might get a favorable lead (but still only up to 9 tricks.|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|nt|rick3son:  what is the exchange rate on canadian masterpoints to US Joey?|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|Vugraphzfb: The kibitzing rules on site don't have to do with "Open" & "Closed" rooms - those are just designations to tell us which teams sit where.|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|fabsayc: 10 to 1 :)|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |

pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt|ahollan1: [i think]|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: big clubbers don't need 1x-1y-2N to show a big balanced hand, so it can be used for other things like the Bridge World death holding of 3-fit + good 6 card suit|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt|Henryb:  so, lets assume a diamond lead. can this be made? I think so: four major suit tricks, three diamonds and two clubs|

nt|granguru:  with adequate covers, or might invite if possible, or can look for the min bid available...In this style I find better to play Ghestem, or even better italian Ghestem than Michaels, as the 2 suits are shown almost always with one bid|
pg| ***** 646 ***** |


mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|chip: showing both suits is useful, though if do so at 3 level lose some ability to sort out ranges.  Meckwell do play some 3C bids to show two suits.|

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|rick3son:  rabbi's rule: when the king is singleton offside, play the ace!|

pg| ***** 650 ***** |


nt|meargent: does hayden have a sense of humour?|
pg| ***** 651 ***** |


nt|chip: That is some opening bid by Passell even playing light openers. Will see if his signoff stops Hayden.|

pg| ***** 660 ***** |

pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|

pg| ***** 666 ***** |


nt|meargent: passell had the chance over 4@Ds which had set trumps to bid 4@Hs or 4@Ss or 5@Cs and when he did neither of these 3 things hayden should have gone quietly despite his19 hcp|
pg| ***** 667 ***** |
