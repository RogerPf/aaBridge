North leads the @s9.  Clearly declarer has nine tricks when he gets in (the club finesse is right if he needs it).  Partner needs @HKxxxx or @HK10xx.  Switch to the @HA, @HQ and another heart.

^*bCount winners.  Think what partner needs for you to beat the contract.^*n|pg||

If the @CJ is a true card there is little chance - partner can only have a King at most.  The best chance is that North has the singleton club.  Continue with the @CK.

Partner can't have much.  If he has the @SA, you will only make the @HA, @SA, and @CK.  He can't really have @SAK, so the only chance for four tricks is if he has the @CA.  You must switch to the @cK.

It holds, partner playing the @H3.  Declarer has @HAJ left, so you need partner to have a diamond stopper and a black Ace.  Which Ace?  The @CA probably isn't enough.  You can clear the hearts but declarer will hold up the @HA and finesse diamonds, and partner can't get you in fast enough - declarer will rise with the @SA on the return.  Play partner for the @SA, therefore, and switch to the @s8.

nt|North leads the @h4.  Declarer wins the @HJ and leads a club to the @CJ and your @CQ.  Even if partner has @HKQ he can't have an entry.  The best chance is that he holds the @CA, in which case there's a sure way to defeat the contract - you must switch to the @SJ.

^*bAsk 'where are the defensive tricks coming from?'^*n|

nt|North leads the @h4 and your @hK wins.  Partner might have running hearts but there's no rush to cash them - you can do so later, when you win the @DK, if necessary.  Switch to the @S2, in case partner has @HA and @SQ.

^*bTry to keep your options open.^*n|

nt|Partner leads the @s3.  Best is to ^*iduck^*n (this must be a singleton).  Now if declarer needs to lose to both of your Aces you can first play a low spade, knocking out the bare Ace, and then cash your spades.

^*bThink about the whole hand to see how to play a suit.^*n|

nt|Partner leads the @CK and declarer ruffs the third round, draws two rounds of trumps ending in dummy and leads a diamond.  If he has a void in diamonds - or the @DA - you can count him for ten tricks.  The only critical case is when he has the singleton @DJ.  You must go up with the @DK, otherwise he can take a ruffing finesse later.

^*bConcentrate on layouts where your play makes a difference.^*n|
