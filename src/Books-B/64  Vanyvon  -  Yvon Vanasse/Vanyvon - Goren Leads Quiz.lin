This is referred to as "unblocking" the suit, or getting your high cards out of the way.|pg||lc|sa|md|akqj54|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK     ~    @sQ    ~@s4 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3This is the standard lead against suit contracts.|pg||lc|s|at|

Many modern players lead Ace from Ace-King.|pg||nt|^B@2^Z@3Against suit contracts the King asks for attitude.|pg||at|

Do not unblock from three cards to an honor.|pg||LC|SK|md|akq234|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~   @sQ     ~@s4 ^1|hc|sA|nt|^B@2^Z@3This is still the standard lead against Notrump contracts.|pg||at|

Opener is telling partner to unblock the suit.|pg||lc|sA|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sQ    ~@s4 ^2|hc|sk|nt|^B@2^Z@3This is a standard lead against suit contracts.|pg||lc|sK|md|akq23|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sQ    ~@s3 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3The King is the proper lead because the suit is not long enuogh to have partner toss in her highest card.|pg||at|

The King asks partner to give "attitude." - High encourages and low discourages.|pg||lc|sk|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sQ    ~@s3 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3Again the standard lead is the @sK.|pg||at|

Agree with your partner in advance before you get into trouble whether you lead the Ace or King from Ace-King.|pg||lc|sk|md|akq2|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sQ    ~@s2 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3Again the opening leader is asking for partner's attitude to the suit.|pg||lc|sK|md|ak2|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK       ~    @s2       ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3The King is the standard lead from most Ace-King combinations.|pg||lc|sK|md|akjt|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~     @sJ     ~    @s10      ^2|hc|sk|nt|^B@2^Z@3The King is the standard lead from most Ace-King combinations.|pg||lc|sk|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK       ~    @sJ      ~@S10 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3I promise you get to lead something besides a King soon.|pg||lc|sK|md|akjt|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sJ    ~@s10 ^2|hc|sk|nt|^B@2^Z@3I promise!|pg||lc|sk|md|akj23|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sJ     ~@s3 ^4|hc|s3|nt|^B@2^Z@3Leading from the top is too risky here.|pg||at|

You should be willing to sacrifice one trick to set up four.|pg||nt|^B@2^Z@3If you partner has only a doubleton Spade and an outside entry the @s3 is your safest lead here.|pg||at|

Better yet, imagine your partner has the doubleton @sQ4.|pg||lc|s3|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA     ~      @sK      ~   @sJ    ~@s3 ^4|hc|sk|nt|^B@2^Z@3The @sK is the standard lead.|pg||at|

Do not lead low and give up a trick.|pg||lc|sk|md|akj2345|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~     @sK     ~    @sJ    ~@s3 ^1|hc|sa|nt|^B@2^Z@3Again you want your partner to play the @sQ if she has it so you can run 6 tricks.|pg||lc|sa|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sJ    ~@s3 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3Again the standard lead is the @sK.|pg||lc|sK|md|ak2345|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @sJ    ~@s4 ^4|hc|s4|nt|^B@2^Z@3The fourth best Spades is best.|pg||at|

You are willing to give up a trick to bring the rest of the suit home.|pg||lc|s4|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @s10    ~@s2 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3Lead the @sK, do not lead low and risk taking no tricks in the suit.|pg||lc|sK|md|akt92|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @s10    ~@s9 ^3|hc|sT|nt|^B@2^Z@3If your partner holds either the @sQ or @sJ you should take at least 4 tricks in this suit.|pg||Lc|sT|md|akt923|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK       ~    @s10    ~@s9 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3The King is your best option here using standard leads.|pg||lc|sK|md|ak234|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @s4    ~@s3 ^4|hc|s3|nt|^B@2^Z@3Fourth best is the standard lead against notrump.|pg||lc|s3|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sK      ~    @s4    ~@s3 ^2|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3Again the standard lead is the King.|pg||lc|sK|md|aqj23|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sQ      ~    @sJ    ~@s3 ^2|hc|sQ|nt|^B@2^Z@3The Queen is your best opportunity to develop the suit.|pg||lc|sQ|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sA      ~      @sQ      ~    @sJ    ~@s3 ^1|hc|sA|nt|^B@2^Z@3If you don't play your Ace here you may lose it forever.|pg||lc|sA|md|kqj23|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sK      ~      @sQ      ~    @sJ    ~@s3 ^1|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3After you drive out the Ace you have a good chance to take 4 tricks in this suit.|pg||lc|sKl|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sK      ~      @sQ      ~    @sJ       ~@s3 ^1|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3Drive out the Ace to make sure that you get the tricks you deserve.|pg||lc|sk|md|kqt32|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sK      ~      @sQ      ~      @s10      ~@s3 ^1|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3The King is the standard lead.|pg||lc|sk|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sK      ~      @sQ      ~      @sJ      ~@s3 ^1|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3The King is the standard lead.|pg||lc|sk|md|kq742|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sK      ~      @sQ      ~      @s7      ~@s4 ^4|hc|s4|nt|^B@2^Z@3Fourth best is your best chance to develop this suit combination.|pg||lc|s4|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sK      ~      @sQ      ~      @s7      ~@s4 ^1|hc|sK|nt|^B@2^Z@3Do not give up your deserved tricks by leading fourth best.|pg||lc|sk|md|qjt32|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sQ      ~      @sJ      ~      @s10       ~@s3 ^1|hc|sQ|nt|^B@2^Z@3This is a perfect sequence to lead from.|pg||lc|sq|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Suit contract? ^ &   @sQ      ~      @sJ      ~      @s10      ~@s3 ^1|hc|sQ|nt|^B@2^Z@3Perfect sequences are usually always best to lead.|pg||lc|sq|md|qj742|nt||lb|*MWhich card is your best opening lead against a Notrump contract? ^ &   @sQ      ~      @sJ      ~      @s7      ~@s4 ^4|hc|s3|nt|^B@2^Z@3This combination needs either the 10 or 9 to be good enough to lead the top card.|pg||hc|s4|at|
