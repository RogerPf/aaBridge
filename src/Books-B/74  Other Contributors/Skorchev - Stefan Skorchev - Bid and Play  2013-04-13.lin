MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

It looks normal, but I can offer you an option.
After 3@H by North, South should obviously accept with 17 count, but first we can consider another game - 3NT
We have flat 4333 hand with honors in all suits|pg||sk|n|at|
Over 3NT, North would happily pass with the same flat 4333|pg||nt||at|Skorchev: 3NT is an easier contract, as you can make 3@H + 2@S + 2@C + 2@D = 9 tricks
Anyway, 4@h is not that hopeless
It's still a fine contract|pg||nt||at|BabsG:  Should North bid Stayman with 4333 or just an invitational 2NT?
Skorchev: Theory says that it's better to bid NT with 4333 only if partnership has 29+ points
In the range between 25-28 points, contract in a Major is usually more successful
That's why I would recommend Stayman here.
Stayman can be balanced, it's still better to be in a Major|pg||nt||at|Skorchev: Only when 4333 opposite 4333 it's better to be in NT
Here you could manage to discover that
(South has an opportunity to show the 4333 with 3NT, and North could pass)|pg||nt||

Just at the end you could try your chance by getting West to play a spade
But how?
After drawing trumps, simply play @CAK and third club.
If West holds @CQJx, he must win the club trick and underlead his @SQ, ensuring the contract.|pg||nt||at|(MM: with @cQxx, a west suspecting an endplay coming, might discard the @cQ under the AK 
in the hope that partner holds the J.
West thrown in with the third club has to open the spades or give you a ruff-and-sluff)

mb|p|mb|1n|at|Skorchev: I would definitely recommend 1NT opening with 5332 hand having 5-card Major. 
It describes you better
If you open 1M and get preempted, it will be difficult to describe yourself afterwards
|pg||nt||mb|p|sk|w|lb|*bPlease click West's bid on the right^^2c|mb|2c|at|Skorchev: Having 5-4 in the Majors it's safety to start with Stayman, 
If partner bids 2@D, you simply bid 2 of your longer Major (showing 5-4)
If you transfer to your longer Major you may find partner with only a doubleton, but 4 cards in your other Major ... 
that's why we start with  Stayman first - if partner bid 2M we pass it, if partner bid 2@D - 
We just bid 2 of our longer Major and partner pass|pg||nt||at|
(MM: Note that in sayc rebidding 2@s after 2@d shows an invitational 5-4 hand
and therefore would not suggest "partner pass". Partner "pass" with a minimal hand
Jumping in your 5-card Major is Game Forcing)|pg||nt||mb|p|sk|e|lb|*bPlease click East's bid on the right^^3h|mb|3h|an|5 hearts and max|at|Skorchev: With East's hand having 17 points and 5M you can jump to 3M 
as partner has either an INV+ hand or weak with both Majors (* see previous note)
That may help partner to decide better with invitational hands ...or if partner is weak, 
it will preempt eventual bidding intentions by the opposition.
|pg||nt||mb|p|mb|4hppp
|pg||

at|donnaruthe:  Are there situations when you would NOT bid 1NT when you have a 5-card Major?
Skorchev: Well, some experts recommend to avoid opening 1NT with 5M and doubleton in the other Major, 
as you may find 5-2 contract instead of 5-3
But from my experience I can say you should always open 1NT with any 5332 and 15-17 points
sblitz:  Would it matter if you didn't have a stopper in one of the suits?
Skorchev: Nope, life is not perfect ... you have just 15-17, you can't always cover all the suits|pg||nt||at|
Skorchev: The problem is that if you open 1M and opps interfere you can hardly describe yourself
Or if let's say partner bid 2/1....say 1@H - 2@D
What do you bid - 3NT?
That's only preempting partner
If you open 1NT you can easily show your hand at a lower level and leave more bidding room|pg||nt||

10 points opposite 15-17 NT is enough for game.
Over 2@H if you jump to 3NT you are suggesting 4 cards in Spades, otherwise you wouldn't bid Stayman.
Try to be in 4M with fit, it gives you better opportunities
Your clubs are weak as well, opponents doubled, so you must be afraid of that suit.

fp|1|cp|9|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2MM: When we're missing the 2 high honors:

Declarer W:          Dummy E:
@h 532                @h AJT96

The 2 important missing cards are the @hK and the @hQ
Where can they be?

There are only 4 possible situations:
1: Both in N
2: Both in S
3: K in N, Q in S
4: Q in N, K in S

When both in North: We lead low to the A-JT combination 
Only the K OR the Q will make for defense => situation 1 will work, 1 out of the 4 = 25%

When the honors are "split" (situation 3 and 4)
Again we lead low to the JT, and that will lose to either the K or the Q in South.
But our second finesse will succeed. Therefore both situations (3 + 4) will work, 
that's 2 out of the orriginal 4 = 50%

Since situation 1, 3 and 4 all work, we can add those chances, 25 + 50 = 75%  (3 out of 4)

The only situation where BOTH honors would make a trick is situation 2. (BOTH in South)
We try the finesse, and it loses... we repeat the finesse, and again it loses. This only occurs in situation 2. 
That is 1 out of the 4 possibilities. Therefore 25% of the time we'll "go wrong".|pg||
