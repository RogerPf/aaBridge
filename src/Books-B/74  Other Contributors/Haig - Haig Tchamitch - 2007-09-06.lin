nt|Hmm... looks like South will probably start with a marginal 1@d opening, but pass is acceptable.|pg||
mb|1C|
nt|South decided to put his best foot forward..and start with 1@c. I admit that as South I would have opened the bidding 1@D, and then competed with 3@c I know your clubs are much better but being able to compete and get both your suits in is also important.|pg||
mb|1H|
nt|West overcalled 1@h and that was correct should not make a takeout double with that hand.|pg||
mb|1S|
nt|I assume you play negative doubles. North should make a negative double showing exactly 4 card @s rather than bid 1@S otherwise you show a 5 card @s suit.|pg||

nt|West has 4 losers on a normal line of defence. If I was north I would lead a @C the reason being when partner opens a possibly weakish hand in third seat it is usually because they have a good suit.|pg||

nt|I don't like the 1@d overcall on a 4 card suit and a very balanced hand almost better to make a T/O double you have support for all suits.

You can go to jail for overcalling 4 card minors ... especially if they are under 18 :) LOL|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|
nt|The 1NT by South is a good bid, he has some values and certainly a stopper or 2 in @c. the 1NT final contract is very reasonable place. 

I know North has a good hand, sort of, but it is not good enough to do anything withyou can make a T/O double with a balanced hand type, if you have about 14 highcards or better. The North hand is a bad 12, 2 stray jacks are not particularly endearing.|pg||

But to get a heart trick, you need to dislodge the AK first and you need partner's cooperation in that.|pg||
nt|No special lesson in this other than lead towards the short honors (@c) first and East should signal for a @h rather than a @d, South would bid 1NT if North makes a TO double they have 9 points and plenty of club stoppers.|pg||

nt|OK... This boardd started quite normally but then some gremlins showed up :) I am in full agreement up to the 3@C bid after that North should pass and that would end the auction. If North were to Double 3@c like he did he is showing a hand worth about 17 points, and short in @C North has a nice 14 but I would not stretch it that far :).

OK... Once North double 3@c what should E do? Do they have anything more than the T/O double they already made? No... they have a normal T/O double but no extras and not even a 4th club to get overly excited.|pg||
nt|Yes, I think East should pass they already said their piece with the T/O South will of course bid 3@D more out of fright than anything else :) and West can now either compete with 4@c.. ( I don't like that) or say double, which says I like my hand partner do something, East would probably pass that would result in -300 for NS maybe more. :-)|pg||
pc|HK|
nt|In 4@c, West has 3 losers at least. They have 4@S tricks after trumps are gone, 1@H, 1@d, so they need 4@c tricks, seeing that you are missing the AJT of clubs, you need some luck not to lose 2 @C tricks so you have to hope that North is kind of short in @c and has the Ax. So after winning the first @h, should play a @c towards the Q.|pg||

Let me SAY this very CLEARLY. ^*bYOU NEVER TAKE RUFFS IN THE LONG TRUMP HAND!^*  unless you have to (opps make you do it) or you are setting up a long suit in the other hand. Those long trumps are yours anyway, but if you are busy ruffing things you don't need, all of a sudden you are going to find that one of the opps has more trumps than you and that will make somebody happy (no, not your partner) LOL|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2S|an|michael's - H and minor|
nt|East opened 1@s, I think South should overcall 2@h rather than michael's, the problem with michael's with that hand is that if partner picks @d with 3 card suit and they also have 2 cards in @h you are way better off in the @h fit.

What did the michaels bid of 2@S showed? 5 or more @h and 5 or more of a minor.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|I like the 3@s raise with the W hand.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|And now I think north with a good hand and a know 5-3 or better @h fit should bid 4@h, 4@d is great to get partner to lead a @d if the opps bid 4@s, but it just muddies the water and if east were to pass you might end up playing in 4@d when you could possibly make 4@h.

West is very close to a limit raise and they could stretch to make one. How does West make a limit raise in @s in this hand? You Q bid the opps suit and the 'known' suit in this case is @h|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|As you can see no game contract make by N-S, 5@d is off 2 clubs and the trump ace.

How do we beat the 4@h contract by North? East-West can make 4@S they can beat 4@h.
^*bjamiehm:^* You lead a @d then @c and you get a ruff.

As you can see 4@S is cold however so North-South bidding to the 5 level in a red suit was a good thing for them and they got a bonus when the lead was favorable.|pg||

nt|Good pass, that is not a 2@s opening.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|waiting|mb|p|mb|3H|
nt|West has a balanced hand, he should rebid 3NT to show about 25 points. and the East will bid 4@h which is still a transfer to @s.|pg||
nt|A texas transfer is when you transfer to the major at the 4 level so if partner opened 1NT a normal transfer (Jacoby) is 2@h  >>> to 2@s. Usually when you transfer at the 2 level you have typically a 5 card suit. If you choose to bid 1NT >>> 4@H >>> to 4@s, that means that you are playing in @s for sure and partner only promised 2 of them so to have an 8 card fit, you need to have 6 or more.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

nt|Back to this hand, auction started fine till the 2@d bid. After that West should bid 3NT showing about 24-26 points and a balanced hand. West should not worry about missing a @h fit because  over 3NT you can still bid 4@c as stayman, and 4@d and 4@h are still transfers. I know this type of auction does not come up very often but it is important to get these big hands right. |pg||

nt|The auction should go 2@C >>> 2@d >>> 3NT >>> 4@h >>> 4@s >>> and a pushy 5@s by east if they are feeling adventurous. East has long @s and some values however, the @s suit is a bit anemic slam is not great.. you need spades to break 3-2, and then you need to bring clubs in for no losers.|pg||

nt|^*Banco:^*N Why not 2@h after 2@c?
Because if East bids 2@h after opening 2@c that shows an unbalanced hand with at LEAST 5 OR MORE @H.

If West had 4 or 5 less points, what would everybody open? 2NT right, nobody would think of opening hearts or anything silly like that.|pg||

nt|^*Bsthrnldy:^*N Couldnt west open 3NT?
Yes if that is there range for 3NT opening. If SAYC opening 3NT shows 25-27 then the West hand is perfect for that, remember balanced hands should be presented to partner as balanced hands, otherwise they get very confused!  :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|an|opening hand and trump support|
nt|Bidding is a language and you have to agree on what things mean. North has 2 choices they can bid 2NT as a Forcing @h raise or start with showing their long suit with 2@c. I prefer 2@C myself especially if playing 2/1.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

nt|The auction started ok although as I said north could have started with 2@c  and then shown heart support later. But this was OK.
^*Bdae:^*N why not jacoby 2NT?
Jacoby tends to be better with more limited hands, this is a big hand and you need to get some cooperation from partner in the club suit.
^*Bdae:^*N Then I would have to bid 2NT as can't reverse?
Dae... You would rebid either 2@h over 2@c especially in 2/1. You have a tough problem in SAYC.|pg||

nt|But when North bid 2NT and South bid 4H, South essentially denied a singleton and showed a balanced minimum hand. Now as North if you choose to bid Blackwood, then you should not sign off if you are off only 1 Keycard. Once North bid blackwood and found 1 ace they should just bid the slam because they have 4 out of the 5 remaining Keycards, you only want ot avoid being in slam if you are missing 2 aces for example or an ace and the king of trumps. A good rule is -- if you are good enough to bid blackwood and find you are off only 1 ace then bid the slam.|pg||

nt|I would open the East hand 1NT just because I have a balanced hand and 15-17 points. The problem to open 1@c is that you now have no good rebid when partner responds 1@s.
^*BSandyMacG:^*N I didn't like 2 suits with no honors, and rather short.
Yes I know why you did what you did, and I am not saying you did a bad thing :) it was a thoughful position to take.|pg||
nt|^*BSandyMacG:^*N i was going to rebid 1NT, not happily, in that case
However, you creat jeopardy in getting to game if partner bids 1@s, showing 12 - 14, and partner with some 10 count will pass not visualizing game. And sometimes game does not make. So, what's right? I think I prefer 1NT, it's less complicated.. plus I get to play the hand!!!   LOL...|pg||

nt|North did not open which is good. If North/South are not playing Drury (a convention that tells partner you have a limit raise in their major as a passed hand) then North can either respond 3@s to the 1@S opener by south or try 2@d and hope to survive so they can bid 3@s next time. What do I mean by hope to survive, well as a passed hand if you bid 2@d, and your partner has a mini type hand they know there is no game and they might pass.

South has a @d fit and bidding 2@h is absolutely correct, after that it was easy North bid 3@s, and south looking at a double fit happily accepted game.|pg||
nt|Yes, 2@c is one of the bids for Drury. 2@c and 2@d are both possible drury or reverse drury bids.. IF YOU ARE PLAYING THEM!!!!!!|pg||
