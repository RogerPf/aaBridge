A spade return is a finesse, any other return is a ruff/sluff. This is an example of a strip/elimination and endplay.|pg||

mb|6Hppp|nt|G-Bear: 6@h is a slight overbid, but the hand is makeable with right play. Declarer starts with three possible losers, but the heart finesse MUST be there to make it. However, declarer MUST guard against a 4-1 heart split and be able to finesse three times PLUS get back to dummy after ^*Uunblocking^*  the clubs to discard a losing spade. So since dummy entries are limited, declarer must be very careful to either play the @H8 first or play the @HJ and play the @H9 or @h10 from her hand so the lead will remain in dummy for two more finesses. |pc|CT|pg||

mb|-7Dppp---|nt|Make your plan: 2 methods could be used. Relying on the @s finesse or set-up the @h suit for a @s discard. A good declarer would combine the chances by 1st trying to set-up the dummy long suit and if it fails, only then try the @s finesse. 
Order of play is important here. You must realize that the @d2 could be used as a mean to create a 3rd entry to dummy. Finally, It is better to trump the hearts first just in case they don't split.|

mb|--1H1s2sp4hppp--|nt|G-Bear: This is another strip and elimination play. Since South bid spades, you have to know that S has the @SK. Since both declarer and dummy have an even number of spades, just give South his two spade tricks. South can cash is @SJ, but is then endplayed. He has to either lead a club or give a ruff/sluff.|pc|H2|pg||pc|H3|pc|H5|pc|HA|pg||

mb|---2cp2dp2hp3h|an|positive|mb|p4np5dp6hppp-|nt|G-Bear: The KEY is not wasting dummy's high spades and winning the first trick with the A. The ONLY possible entry to dummy is in the spade suit.  Your plan is to pull trumps, unblock the club suit, and access the dummy with your spade entry allowing you to discard a loser on the @cK.|pc|S2|pg||

G-Bear: Now you just have to cover whatever card North plays and South is endplayed. That @H8 in dummy was HUGE. The power of intermediate cards like nines and eights cannot be overlooked. If south returns a diamond then you get a ruff/sluff. |pg||

G-Bear: It seems like North has two unavoidable club losers, but the 3-2 @c split make it possible.  Declarer has to play the club A first then a low club. East is endplayed after winning the K. And it does no good for East to unblock by playing the K under the Ace. Because either he leads the Jack and West lets it hold, or overtakes it with the Q. 
G-Bear: Now an alert East holding just Kx should unblock by playing the K under the A.|

mb|---6Hppp-|nt|This is an other case of combining your chances. You have the possibility of setting-up a spade for a discard if they divide 3-3. Failing this, you will have to rely on the @D finesse. But how do you go about the spades? The key play is to discard a spade on the extra @c winner in dummy allowing you to test the spades with no risks at all. Finally, it is also essential to keep a low heart in hand to get a necessary entry to dummy.|pc|CJ|pg||
