southuist: oops I reversed, and I should not have
MildredB: no, u didn't reverse, I made a neg X
southuist: well I understood the neg X
moonjohn: and I bidded it wrong should have been 1@d.. I do that sometimes when in sequence|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: so when you bid major, it is not 'reverse' at least not in values
southuist: but didn't I go too high?
MildredB: if you are going to open 1@C, you have to get spades bid at some point
southuist: Would you prefer me to open @s|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Interesting - what to open N hand
If you open 1@C, and rho bid 1@H & pard bid 1NT, now if you bid 2@S it is going to sound like a strong reverse
I would have opened 1@s, but there are times when it works out better to open the longer suit
Karen10: esp if @c and @s right?
MildredB: yes, but that can go awry, if the opps interfer
had N been 5@H & 6@C & chose to open, then I would definitely open 1@H|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Will there be questions from gallery?
Karen10: thought 2@d was pre-empt, and hoped for the sac with 4@d
MildredB: I too thought preemptive
moonjohn, did you bid 5@D to make?|pg||nt||at|
duffer66: When you said N response to your A clubs lead should be suit preference?
not attitude? So had she played the 3 clubs what would that tell u?
MildredB: yes, when singleton in dummy and I'm going to hold the trick, pard's card should be SPS (suit preference signal)
low for @H, high for @S and middle for continuation 
southuist: I felt I should keep the @cK
MildredB: I didn't mean the K|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: some times it is not easy to read
7 would be high, 3 would be low and the 5 would be middle
duffer66: and you advocate leading A of P's first bid suit?
MildredB: from this hand, I didn't have a better lead, I didn't think
zasanya: should the N hand be opened at all?
southuist: rule of 20...(21)|pg||nt||at|

MildredB: partner, I think you have at least a LR (Limit Raise)
I play that after overcall a cue-bid = LR or better
Sunrise4U->Kibitzers: 1@S - 2@h - 4@S|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: This is an import concept
how to make a LR after opps overcall
1@S (2@H) 3@S is still preemptive
I think that it has become standard to use cue-bids to show a limit raise
1@S (2@H) 2@S = simple raise while 3@S is preemptive and cue-bid 3@H = limit raise (or better by unpassed hand)
Does anyone play this?               (most kibbies do)|pg||nt||at|
Karen10: How would you bid this if you have agreed with p that a cue limit raise = 4-card support? 
MildredB: I would bid 3@H over 2@H
duffer66: What would 4@h say?  Is that still a splinter in hearts and must you have 4 spades?
MildredB: 4@H would be a SPL - I do not make direct splinters with only 3 trump...SPL are always jumps
bizarro: Isn't norths hand worth about 12 points?
MildredB: yes, at least 12 in support of @S|pg||nt||at|
jpainter:  Why doesn't E open 2@D?
duffer66: personally in 2nd seat I like the suit to be a skosh stronger?
MildredB: I would have opened 2@D
then the auction would have gone:  P (2@D) 2@S (P) 3@D = LR or better
grmaan: What about 1@D opener in north?
MildredB: No I would never open 1@D in north, if you make me open I open 1@C|pg||nt||at|
tan1944: North 3@C  open may be
MildredB: That suit doesn't look like 3@C bid to me
most likely when you open at 3 level you have 7 cards
dee_dee_20: Isn't there a chance of pre-empting your partner  once 1st seat passes? (by bidding 2@d)
your RHO has passed  you have a weak pre-empt...   Your part is likely with some points?|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Usually 2@D doesn't preempt your pard from bidding 
Change the suit to @S - I'd open 2@S
I don't worry about preempting my pard, I worry about showing my hand to help pard know what to do
If my pard can't bid over 2@S, then it isn't our hand
dee_dee_20: great point
wvajuju: please address 3@s bid
MildredB: It is competitive, not a game try, usually shows a 6th trump & not dead minimum - & most likely some shape|pg||nt||pc|DT|pc|DJ|pc|DK|pg||

whymsie:  Perfect hand for WJS (Weak Jump Shift) by west?
MildredB: If they play WJS
amcs:  Obviously I did not know what to do--pass best?
MildredB: Do most of you play WJS in response to opener?|pg||nt||at|
Kibbies: yynnyynnyn
MildredB: If you play WJS, I think 2@H is the bid
I'm just not much on bidding & then passing a forcing bid
I am very diciplined in that respect
tutootsie: 1@S by E is forcing?
MildredB: I mean, I don't bid, and then leave pard in 4-2 fit|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Suppose your pard bids 2@S over your 1@H - what are you going to bid?
Not using WJS, just better to pass 1st time & then bid

I think actually east is very close to jump shift (= strong)

If pard bids 2@H, then east has real decision to make - bid 3 or 4|pg||nt||at|
kat827:  Did you consider a 1@D overcall?
MildredB: no, I did not, I wanted to make a call to show @S & @D
My pard and I play conventional jump shifts to open - except for 1@C (P) 2@D which we play is strong|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Why not lead the 4@H?
I do not want to ruff, I want to shorten declarer
If I lead @D and shorten declarer, not only do I get my suit set up, but I have longer trumps than declarer|pg||nt||

So I'm in no hurry to 1. take up bidding room, 2. bid 2NT w/o a stopper in either Major

Tinevale:  A 1@D can be 3-card....By rebid you show strength with intent to support Clubs next round?
you could bid 3@c?
MildredB: We are playing 2/1|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: I don't really have a lot to say right now
I thought I'd keep the auction low and see what pard is doing?
If he wants to bid 2NT - must be better than me playing it
If I bid 2NT, I have no assurance they can't take the first 5 @S-tricks|pg||nt||at|
Josephine7:  What would you bid in sayc?
MildredB: I bid the same
I think that in SA, a new suit at the 2-level over opening bid promises another call, no?
Or at least it did 50 years ago when I learned it :)
tutootsie: Should N bid her spades first or 2/1 bid clubs?
MildredB: I would have:  1@D-2@C-2@D -2@S - 3@C - 3NT|pg||nt||at|
realrowdy:  To be honest I was not 100% sure a 1@s response was more honest
MildredB: I could understand your wanting to bid 1@S
But you have 15 hcp, no reason to not bid the hand naturally
Besides, 2@C is GF - I'm a big fan of bidding as naturally as possible when the hand belongs to us|pg||nt||at|
duffer66: I am still amazed over @d rebid
MildredB: :)  I understand
duffer66: my P's would expect 6 or 5 strong every day;  so this is a great discussion
MildredB: but I can't bear to bid 2@H
If we are going to play @H, surely better for my pard to play

MildredB->Kibitzers: neg doubles do not apply if you have pre-empted|pg||nt||
mb|p|pg||sk||at|MildredB: good noone plays negX after pard preempts
If you think about it, when pard preempts, you know of 6 if not 7 of his cards|pg||nt||at|
MICK357: What is your standard for an overcall of a weak 2; points and suit quality.  and for a double?
MildredB: If the vulnerbility had be flip flopped, I would not o/c with east hand
You want a good suit and more than minimum opening
This east hand is an 'ok' 2@S bid, but I'd never do it if vul
Also depends on what game you're playing, I beef my o/c up when playing imps|pg||nt||at|
duffer66: Are you more aggressive in matchpoints? More conservative in imps?
MildredB: I am more aggressive bidding slams and in o/c'ing
I am equally agressive in bidding vul games
vanyvon: More aggressive bidding slams while playing matchpoints?
MildredB: yes, games I strive for in imps|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: When pard opens and next o/c, if you have LR or better, try using cue-bid and reserving the jump to game for weaker hands
Like with 5 trumps to K , singleton  and 7 total hcp
Sometimes, pard needs to know which strength hand you have|pg||nt||

MildredB: ok, this hand can be made
You should lead the A or K of @S from your hand
but even when you didn't do that, you can make it
After leading 2 trumps, play AK @C and 3rd @C
then when they break, play @HAK and ruff 3rd @H|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Then lead good @C from dummy  and pitch @D loser as east ruffs with natural trump trick
Main thing to do, is cash A or K @S in your hand
then you can pick up Jxxx from either side|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: I often think to myself when declaring, ok, what can go wrong?  Is there anything I can do to prevent it harming the hand?

pc|D9|at|hope: gl M
MildredB: I don't need luck w/ your beautiful dummy, this is a good auction to discuss
I play that Hope's 3@H bid = very good single raise  while cue-bidding would show limit raise or better
Same would apply if auction went (1@D) 1@H (P) 2@H = simple raise, while 2@D would show Limit Raise (LR) or better
Most play that jump raises of o/c are preemptive
3@H raise of 2@H overcall shows good raise 8+; 3@H isn't 'weak' - it shows a raise, but less than limit raise|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Using cue-bids as showing LR or better is a great tool
Same applies if I open 1@H and they o/c 2@D
2@H is 6-9 raise    3@D is presumed to be LR but could be better
(2@D) 2@H (P) 3@H = 8- to bad 10 raise, while cue-bidding 3@D = limit raise or better|pg||nt||at|

pc|SA|at|MildredB: obviously N/S can make 4@H and yet the suit never got into the auction
We have 3 ways that we might get @H's bid, this is a lot of partnership agreement
1.  N can make a take-out double and if pard bids @C, correct to @D
2.  N can o/c 2@D and then double the 2@S bid and if pard bids @C correct to @D
3.  South can make responsive X|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: Let's start with number 3:  I did not think that my hand was strong enough to make a responsive X
Does anyone play responsive X's?
Kibbies yyynyynn
MildredB: Would those of you who do play it, make responsive X over 2@S?
Would anyone bid 3@D with the south hand over 2@S? I didn't because once again I thought I wasn't strong enough, particularly 3 level vul!|pg||nt||at|dee_dee_20: would you say   11 points needed for responsive?
MildredB: Really depends on what level you are forcing pard to bid at
   1@C - 1@S - 2@C - X
doesn't have to be very strong - since pard can get out at 2 of their suit
MildredB: @sKQ87, @hJ543, @d432, @c54  LHO opens 1@C - 1@D - 2@C - make responsive X|pg||nt||at|
Redbird44:  would that be a neg X?
MildredB: neg X is when pard opens and RHO overcalls and you X (for Responder)
This is about responsive X (for Advancer)
billyjef:  How high do you play responsive X?
MildredB: very high, the higher the less perfect it may be
But when the opp open 1 suit and then jump to 4 level - you don't have enough trumps to be doubling for penalty
It must show strength
|pg||nt||at|
MildredB: ok, so North can now X 2@S since she was willing to bid 3@D all by herself
wyoming33: guess Take-Out X by North way to get @H into the bidding
MildredB: overcalling 1st is my choice but then X-ing back in over 2@S

pc|C3|at|MildredB: ok, let's talk about auction
Is 1NT forcing?
Lizabc: No, just didn't like her suit
MildredB: Right, but you have 5 spades, you must bid 1@S
I think 2@S by east is a bit of an overbid
Ok, so 1NT not forcing..... It takes 18 to reverse, right?|pg||nt||at|
DonnaS:  yes  not really strong enough to reverse
but didn't want to rebid my hearts and I don't like NT
MildredB: If she doesn't have 4 spades and she doesn't have 3 hearts, then 1NT is the place to be
If she was not a passed hand and you played 1NT as forcing, I'd rebid 2@C with east's hand
Sometimes bidding requires us to chose the lesser of all lies|pg||nt||at|
DonnaS:  Yes  but not forcing, was worried that she would pass 2@c
MildredB: if she passes 2@C then, if she has 2 hearts will have 5 clubs!
You bid 2@S thinking she didn't have 4 spades, right?
DonnaS:  yes
MildredB: ok, and 2@S is forcing
If you are going to shade your forcing bids, you do so when you think fits are in the offering|pg||nt||at|
Lizabc: I bid NT, showing 6-10 points looking for another suit I could support
MildredB: yes, but bidding 1NT denies 4 spades! When partner opens, responder should bid her suits up the line unless she has a game forcing hand in which case she can bid a longer suit 1st
Lizabc: she must have 5 hearts to open
MildredB: yes, I agree 5 hearts|pg||nt||at|
Lizabc: she did not rebid  them, but I can support @S, should I pass her 2@S?
MildredB: No, you should not pass 2@S, I'd have bid 4@S
I'm big on giving myself extra values for extra trump length :)
Most important thing for you to change in this auction is bidding 1@S over 1@H

a hand, not good enough to transfer to @S and then raise partners 2@s|pg||nt||

pc|H2|at|MildredB: You should make it a rule, not to raise pard's 2nd bid  suit directly w/o 4 pieces
I would rebid 2@S over 2@D, I do not play that promises 6
kyno40: I do
MildredB: I do promise that 2@H bid promises 4 hearts :)
kyno40: ok so after the 2@D what should I have bid? We where in gameforce 
MildredB: I would bid 2@S, but you don't want to do that, so I guess you could bid 3@D|pg||nt||at|
masse24: ......or 2NT, the "other" catch-all" choice?
MildredB: if your @D & @C were reversed you could bid 2NT|pg||nt||

jkk9175: What should I have led...maybe a @D?
MildredB: I don't think I'd have led @D in this auction
It sounded to me from the auction that west was 5431
so I'd have led @CA
jkk9175: was trump okay?
MildredB: I try my best not to lead a trump - if I do, I try to make it from a holding that can't give up a trick|pg||nt||

MildredB: This hand is very hard to get to 6 much less 7
Had they bid 6@D, I would have bid 6@S
West has the perfect King, not to mention @cQJ  doubleton
Meant that the QJ of @C had to be doubleton in opp hand|pg||nt||at|
hope: Was the 2@s bid OK?
MildredB: I would not have opened 2@S, but my partnerships have agreed to a decent suit - it is all in the agrements
masse24: @SK lead. Due to the contract level being at the 5 level?
MildredB: yes, at 5-level or above, I lead K from AKx or KQ 
andnow:  May I ask about that leading of K at higher levels?
MildredB: I play at these high levels, A asks attitude and K asks count - not perfect but at least we know what we are doing|pg||nt||at|
BILmanager: @D This is the last hand for today
