After hs cashes 3 top red truicks, he must lead a spade to the board into the @SAQ! |pg||sk||pg||pc|h8csh|pg||pc|dccd|pg||pc|hhsd|pg||pc|ssss|pg||up|28|pg||nt|I have backed it up 7 tricks. Note that at this point, all I need to do is look for EAST spade discards. I already have a full (shape) count of the hand. If EAST holds onto 2 spades, I can lead a heart later on and EAST will have to lead spades to the board for the 100% free finesse as I just showed you!|pg||sk||pg||nt|However, this time, EAST will pitch 2 spades. I will then be forced to guess whether he has the @SK or not.|pg||pc|ckcss|pg||pc|cqcdh|pg||pc|cjcss|pg||nt|This time EAST has pitched 2 spades. Does EAST have the @SK ready to drop or does WEST, who started with 4 spades, have the King, ready to be finessed?|pg||They only clue is the following question:|pg||lb|*hWhich hand fits a 1 Heart overcall?^^2^St87HKQJ643Dk754^Skt8hkqjt54dk754|nt|MAYBE not the hand with the 9 "HCP". Without the @SK, EAST might overcall 2H. That would be one of the clues in this hand. That and the strange @ST8 falsecards on this particular deal if holding @ST8x. |pg||nt||sk||pc|SJ|pc|S4|pc|Sa|pc|SK|pg||up|44|nt|You can now experiment with the play of the cards.|pg||0
