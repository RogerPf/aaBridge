nt|^*bSqueezes Workshop^*n

There are 11 tricks on top: 3S, 2H, 3D, 3C. The 12th can only come from a long C or D, which means that declarer has to hope for a 3-3 in one of them. Or is there another chance? Yes - if a defender holds 4 or more in both minors - then after 6 tricks he will be squeezed, as he can only keep 7 cards!|pg||pg||

He needs only 1 trick from partner after cashing his 4 diamond tricks. However, S knows about squeezes, so when W then leads a small spade, S places E with the King and duly makes his contract by squeezing E in the majors. Can you see how W could defeat 3NT?|pg||pg||

After getting in with KH and leading QC through, 3 tricks are in the bag for the defence as W signals for a D. E obeys and now S must decide whether to believe the signal. If W has the QD, the contract is still makeable, provided W led 4th highest spade, and S knows about squeezes....|pg||

East jumps to 4S as suggested by the law of total tricks (bid for number of tricks = combined number of trumps), but South knows that slam should be there. After the 2nd round of spades has been ruffed, drawing trumps reveals a C/D squeeze on E.|pg||pg||

With 8 tricks on top, there are plenty of chances for a 9th - a diamond finesse or a 3-3 break in a red suit would usually be enough, but not this time. The extra chance is that whoever guards clubs also guards the 4th round of diamonds, and declarer should also play for this.|pg||pg||
