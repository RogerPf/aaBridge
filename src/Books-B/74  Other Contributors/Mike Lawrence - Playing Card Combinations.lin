^B@2^y@3"You are in four hearts with A432 in your hand opposite the KJ86 in dummy. How do you play the trump suit? You won't believe the number of ways that exist. This book looks at common card combinations and shows you how circumstances cause you to change your play from one hand to the next. On a given hand, it might be right to play the ace and then finesse. On another layout, the correct play may be to play the ace and king, refusing the finesse. As you will see, very few things about this game are absolute. How to Play Card Combinations shows you when to zig and when to zag in situations which are not as routine as they may appear."

When you need two tricks from this combination, there are two things you can do.|
pg||at|
First, you may be able to endplay your opponents so that they are obliged to lead this suit for you.|pg||at|
Second, if you can't endplay anyone, you have to fall back and hope for a favorable distribution. One such distribution, although unlikely, is to find someone with a singleton king or queen.|pg||

If you guess to lead the ace, the king will fall allowing you to set up a second trick.|pg||at|
The eleven hands that follow show various problems you might face with this combination. Note that even when the opponents lead this suit for you, you are not always home free. There are often hidden traps. Note also that the combination is not always 'right side up'. Sometimes the holdings have been reversed so that North has South's cards and vice versa.|pg||at|
The conditions of contest for the hands in this book will be matchpoints. Once in a while there will be an allusion to IMP strategy but unless noted otherwise, matchpoints will be in effect. My partner in this book is Alex who played so well in ^*IPlay Bridge With Mike Lawrence^*N.|pg||

West leads the king of spades.|pc|sk|pg||at| When the defense leads your weak suit and even worse, leads an honor, there is always a little apprehension.|pg||at| 
I see Alex has been a bit aggressive but I agree with his bid. Opposite a strong (15-17 points) notrump, I think you should raise to game with most nine counts. This one has good points plus a five-card suit.|pg||at|
I also see I needn't be worried about spades. At least not right away. With the king of spades lead, I am assured of two stoppers. This gives me eleven possible winners to choose from.|pg||at| What remains to be seen is how many of them I can get my hands on. What dangers exist?|pg||nt|The only danger is that the spades are five-two and that West can establish them and still have an entry to cash them. If West has four or three spades, three notrump will be safe in all cases.|pg||at|
Can I do anything if West has five spades and both club honors?|pg||at| No. West will use one of the club honors to set up the spade suit and the other club honor to run them. Even if the diamond finesse works, there aren't nine tricks outside of clubs.|pg||at|
What happens if spades are five-two and West has just one club honor?|pg||at| If I win the first spade, thus guaranteeing a second spade trick, the defense can prevail. When I lead a club, East will take it and return his second spade. This clears the spade suit and West still has his entry. The only time the defense loses out is when West has a singleton club honor so that he is obliged to win the first club trick.|pg||nt|Can I overcome five-two spades with divided club honors?|pg||at| Yes. If you look back to the previous paragraph, the key for the defense was for East to win the first club and return his other spade.|pg||at|
What if he doesn't have a spade to lead?|pg||at| If he doesn't have a spade to return, my spades will be safe and I'll have time to get ten tricks.|pg||at|
The way to achieve this is by the apparently foolish play of ducking the first spade. This is approximately 99% safe. I'm going to feel silly if West has led from Kx of spades, but this is a next to impossible lead.|pg||at|
East plays the six and West gives this some thought before continuing with the...|pc|s2s6s5|pg||at| queen. This one I win.|
pc|sQsAss|pg||at| A club to my jack loses to the king.|
pc|cccJcK|pg||at| West leads another spade and East shows out.|
pc|ssds|pg||nt|I expect three notrump to be safe now for two reasons:
1. West looked rather dispirited when he led the third spade. If he had an entry, he would be more interested in the hand.
2. If West started with the KQxxx of spades and the AK of clubs, he would have opened the bidding.|pg||at|
Correct. I concede a club to East and can claim the remaining tricks. Plus 430.|mc|10|sk||sc|y|pg||at|
This is the layout I feared and it was necessary to cater to it. Note that you would not try this play if there were a greater danger.|pg||

^-
With the king of spades lead, you should routinely think about ducking. As long as you trust West to have the KQ, you can always get a second trick since you have the JT intact to take a later finesse. You will never lose a trick and you may gain time.|pg||

^-In four hearts, South gets the king of spades lead. If he wins and leads trump, East will win and will get a spade ruff for down one. If declarer ducks the spade, the defense can't get its ruff.|pg||at|
Declarer loses if spades are six-one, but he gains if they are five-two and the defense can't get a ruff.|pg||at|
Curiously, if declarer's spades were worse, most declarers would do the right thing.|pg||

If South ducks it, West can't lead spades again and must shift. Now declarer has time to set up the diamonds for a spade discard.|pg||

I cash the ace of spades and exit with the four. If East wins, I am home because he has to lead a diamond or else give me a sluff and ruff. East will have the king of spades exactly half the time.|pg||at|

FP|1|CP||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he usual problem with these two combinations is how to get two tricks. If left to your own efforts, you will usually lead toward the queen hoping the king is onside. This is not the only solution nor is getting a second trick the only problem. There are many variations within this suit and there are many defensive falsecards available when declarer plays this suit. It is one of the more exciting combinations to play.|PG||

You get to play more hands. I open ONE NOTRUMP and Alex raises to THREE NOTRUMP. West isn't too sure about his opening lead and he settles eventually on the jack of hearts. |sk|S|sc||pc|HJ|pg||ha||at|
Their convention card says the jack denies a higher honor so I know East has the heart king. Can I use this information. Perhaps.|pg||at|
This is a good lead for me because it assures me of nine tricks even if clubs don't divide. I have four diamonds, three clubs, and by covering the heart, I can set up a sure two tricks in hearts.|pg||nt|Before covering the heart jack I consider that the spade suit is spectacularly dangerous. If West leads a spade, the defense will get anywhere from three to six spade tricks if the ace is offside. Definitely in my interest to keep West off lead if possible.|pg||at|
If I cover the heart jack, I can set up a second heart, but West may use this entry to switch to a spade. Is it possible to keep West off play and still get nine tricks?|pg||at|
If I trust the lead to be from JT or JTx, I think I can do it.|pg||at|
I do not cover the jack. Instead I let the jack come to my ace.|
pc|hhhA|pg||at| I return a heart and finesse dummy's nine. If West has made an honest lead, this will force the king and I will have a ninth trick without letting West in. Of course, if West made an inspired from Jx and East has KTxxx, I'm going down.|
pc|hhh9|
pg||nt|Weighing the dangers I think it pretty clear to play this way. It is very possible for the spade ace to be offside and it is close to being guaranteed, I guess 95%, that West has the ten of hearts.|
pc|hK|pg||at|
This play turns out successfully and East wins the heart king and clears the suit.|
pc|hhhh|pg||at|
I have now seen West play the J, 6 and ten of hearts, and East play the 5, K, and three. I believe East has the last heart, the four, because the correct lead from JT64 is probably the four. I can cash nine tricks now and hope for a tenth trick from clubs or spades. I'd like to try both and I think I can if I'm careful. If I cash diamonds first and then try clubs , I'll be in the dummy. I'd prefer to end in my hand to lead a spade. Certainly I'm not leading spades until I have nine tricks in.|pg||nt|To do this, I cash the clubs first.|
pc|cccAc5|pg||
pc|cKccc|pg||at|
They don't divide and West has the four. Now four rounds of diamonds ending in my hand to lead a spade.|

No good, East claims. At least the heart suit was successful and necessary.|pg||nt|^-^*BFURTHER ANALYSIS^*N|at|

If, on the run of diamonds, either opponent had thrown away the thirteenth heart, that would have guaranteed no ace of spades. Defenders with aces keep winners, not losers.|pg||

Usually you will cash the ace and then take a finesse. There will be reasons why you might choose to vary from this. 
For instance|PG||

pc|sss|pg||at|

pc|sssAh|pg||at|
This fetches the six and eight from West and East.|
pc|hhhAh|pg||at| 
East plays the ten on the next trump. Finesse or not.|
pc|hhT|pg||nt|When opponents overcall as opposed to opening the bidding, their values are less clearly defined. On this hand, there is no reason to place the queen of hearts in either opponents hand. Does it mean I should just finesse because it's the percentage thing to do?|pg||at|
No. Even at matchpoints, there are times when you should make sure of your contract. Hooking the heart is right if you want to make six hearts. The king is right if you want to make five or four hearts.|pg||at|
See what happens if you finesse the jack and lose. West will lead another spade tapping you out of your king of hearts. You'll be able to cash some number of diamonds, but when the opponents come in with their high heart, your hand will be dead.|pg||at|
I play the king of hearts and when West follows small, I run the diamonds, conceding a later trick to the trump queen.|
pc|hKh|pg||
mc|11|sk||sc|y|pg||nt|^-^*BFURTHER ANALYSIS^*N|at|
^-
A small point in the auction. East raised to two spades. Not earth shattering, but important. Raising lets West determine whether to compete, save, pass, or double.
In the play, the jack of trumps is a trap. If declarer didn't have it, it would be routine to play two top hearts followed by diamonds.|pg||

The most frequent question is whether to play the suit straight up, i.e., ace, king, queen, or whether it is right to play the ace, king and then finesse to the ten.|pg||

Now it's time to guess diamonds. I lead the eight and West follows with the seven. Finesse or drop?|

Without clues, I should play for the drop. Do I have reason not to?|pg||at|
What I know for sure is that East has two spades, five or six hearts, two diamonds and two clubs. I ask West what style weak twos they use and he tells me they tend to be traditional meaning good six-card suits.|pg||nt|If I can take East to have six hearts, he has one mystery card. It could be the spade jack or ten, the diamond jack, or the club ten. In practice, the one missing card will not be the spade jack.|pg||at|

There are therefore three cards that East can realistically have. This makes the odds strongly in favor of the diamond finesse. I do finesse and it wins.|pc|dddTh|pg||at|
For whatever it's worth, I know the card that East has. Do you?|pg||

^-East's last card was surely the ten of clubs. When I led to my king of clubs East dropped the jack and West the queen.|pg||at|
If West had the ten of clubs, it means that when I led the club to my hand, West was holding the QT. Most defenders tend, in such circumstances to be ready to win the queen if declarer finesses the jack and they have their ten ready if declarer wins the king.|pg||at|
When the play goes jack from partner and king from declarer, the defender can play either the queen or the ten because they are now equals.|pg||at| A few defenders will think to falsecard the queen, but those who do falsecard usually balk just a second while the realization sets in that the falsecard is okay.|pg||

 These are: 
                                                          1. One heart
                                                          2. Two clubs

                                                          4. Four hearts|pg||at|
Of these, the only one worth rejecting is four hearts. The chances for slam are good and I'm not afraid of the opponents getting into the auction.|pg||nt|I'm going to choose TWO CLUBS but would not object much to two notrump. The reason I reject one heart is that there are too many little hands that will make a game. One heart could work though by keeping us out of an unmakable game but I regard it as pessimistic.|
mb|2c|pg||at|
Alex responds TWO DIAMONDS and I rebid TWO HEARTS. Alex raises to THREE HEARTS. Should I make a slam try? Should I cue bid four clubs or diamonds or should I just bid game?|
mb|p2Dp2Hp3Hp?|pg||at|
Since I don't want to get beyond game unless Alex has a super raise, I bid FOUR HEARTS which is, relatively speaking, a sign off. Alex has a minimum and passes so I play four hearts with the king of diamonds lead.|
mb|4Hppp|pc|DK|pg||nt|Alex's raise to three hearts was a thinking bid but it has gotten us to the wrong game. Three notrump is cold from either side and four hearts is not a lock.|pg||at|
I have nine easy tricks and the tenth must come from spades. There's no way I can come down to a position like I did in the previous hand. I'm am going to have to play spades myself.|pg||at|
At trick one I win the ace of diamonds and draw trump in three rounds.|
pc|dddA|pg||

pc|hKsch|at|
Now to get a spade trick. Should I just lead to the king and hope?|pg||at| I could, but there's a much superior play available, courtesy of the ten of spades. If I lead a spade toward dummy's KT2, I can play the ten rather than the king. If West has the queen and jack, East will be forced to win the ace.|pg||nt|If East wins with the jack or queen, I can still lead toward the king. This gives me a combined chance of around 62 percent which is a worthwhile improvement over the even money chance that West has the ace.|pg||at|
In fact, when I lead the three of spades, West plays the jack. I cover with the king and east wins the ace.|
pc|s3sjsksa|pg||at|
This is promising since West would not play the jack without the queen too.|pg||at|
When I later lead toward the ten of spades, West takes his queen so the ten becomes my tenth trick.|

This delaying play in spades where you first try for the unlikely before committing yourself to your main chance is a standard bridge technique where you combine your chances.|pg||

West raises to THREE SPADES which Alex DOUBLES.|

Under the circumstances I have a good hand. It would be even better if my spade strength were in the minor suits, but my heart holding is superb. I bid FOUR HEARTS and I expect it to be cold or, at worst, down one.|pg||at| The only reason for concern is that Alex may have made an aggressive bid. The opponents have threatened to steal the pot and it's imperative for the person in Alex's seat to get into the auction. Often the only way in is to make a light double based on shape and a prayer.|

Alex has a good hand but four hearts is not cold. I win the opening lead with the queen and lead the queen of hearts.|

West covers so I win and draw a second round.|
pc|hqhkhah|pg||at| West started with the KT9 so I have a trump loser.|
pc|h8c7hjh|pg||nt|It occurs to me that the AQ of spades are not doing me that much good. If they were instead the heart ten and the queen jack of diamonds, four hearts would now be cold.|pg||at|
I am faced with four possible losers. If diamonds divide three-three, I can pitch a club. I can add a little bit to this chance by trying for a partial elimination.|pg||

I cash the spade ace and the diamond ace.|pg||at|
East drops the ten on this.|

When I lead the three of diamonds, East takes the queen and leads the two of clubs.|pg||

Alex had full values for his double. As I noted during the auction, this is one of the sequences where it is necessary to be extremely aggressive.|pg||at|
When the auction starts with 2@H, Pass, 3@H? or 2@S, Pass, 3@S? the fourth player should act almost as if he is balancing as opposed to bidding directly.|pg||
