East has the values for a weak jump but the suit is definitely too poor for that.  I guess GIB decided that 1@h was less risky.|pg||mb|d|nt|My negative double shows four spades and only about 6+ points.|pg||mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|My 2NT raise is a little aggressive.

pc|C6|pc|C4|nt|This is the crucial point of the hand.  The normal play in clubs is to play for the @cJ to drop.  But East started with six hearts and West only one and East two diamonds to West's four.  This means there is more room for West to have the @cJ so GIB finessed.  This time that was wrong.|pg||pc|CT|pc|CJ|pg||
