|pg|nt|qx|Transfers|nt|^*BIntroduction to Jacoby Transfers.^*N

Jacoby Transfers are used over 1NT when responder has a five card or longer major.  Primarily they are used to uncover a five-three or better fit in the major.

The transfer principle is based on bidding the suit immediately below the suit that you hold.  Jacoby transfers are only used to show the major suits.  Therefore a response of 2@d shows five or more hearts and a response of 2@h shows five or more spades.

In response to the transfer opener bids the suit shown by the transfer, that is the suit immediately above responder's bid.  Over 2@d opener rebids 2@h and over 2@h opener rebids 2@s.

The advantages of Jacoby transfers are:

1.  That many more hand types can be shown - see the sequences for weak, invitational, game and slam hands;

2.  Especially over a strong NT the stronger hand gets to play the contract more often.

|pg|nt|qx|Weak|nt|^*BUsing Transfers with an Weak Hand.^*N

Jacoby Transfers can be used as a weak takeout from 1NT with a five card or longer major.

Responder first transfers to the major and then passes openers completion of the transfer.

|pg|nt|qx|Invite|nt|^*BUsing Transfers with an Invitational Hand.^*N

Jacoby Transfers can be used as the first response on an invitational hand.

There are three different situations:  

1.  Responder transfers and then bids 2NT.

This shows an invitational hand with a five-card major.

|ht|k|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2dp2hp2np?|at|
|ht|k|cs|1|at|^O|ia|1np2hp2sp2np?|at|

In response opener can pass (with two cards in the major suit) or bid three of the major (with three or four cards in the major suit) with a minimum 1NT opener or raise to 3NT or bid four of the major with a maximum 1NT opener.
|pg||nt|
2.  Responder transfers and then rebids three of the major.

This shows an invitational hand with a six-card major.

|ht|g|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2dp2hp3hp?|at|
|ht|g|cs|1|at|^O|ia|1np2hp2sp3sp?|at|

In response to this invitation opener either passes with a minimum 1NT opening or raises to four of the major with a maximum 1NT opening.
|pg||nt|
3.  Responder transfers to hearts and then bids spades.

This shows an invitational hand with five hearts and four spades.  It could be the first move on a strong distributional hand with both majors.  Therefore this new suit rebid after the transfer is forcing for one round.

|ht|h|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2dp2hp2sp?|at|


In response with a minimum 1NT opening opener can bid 2NT with no fit, 3@h with a heart fit or 3@s with a spade fit.  With a maximum 1NT opening opener rebids 3NT with no fit and suitable stoppers in the minors, 4@h with a heart fit or 4@s with a spade fit.
|pg|nt|qx|Game|nt|^*BUsing Transfers with an Game-going Hand.^*N

Jacoby Transfers can be used with Game Forcing hands.

As with invitational hands there are three different situations:

1.  Responder transfers and then rebids 3NT

This shows a game forcing hand with a five-card major and offers partner a choice between 3NT and four of the major.

|ht|l|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2dp2hp3np?|at|
|ht|l|cs|1|at|^O|ia|1np2hp2sp3np?|at|

In response opener passes without a fit in the major shown or bids four of the major with three or four cards in the major shown.
|pg||nt|
2.  Responder transfers and then rebids four of the major.

This shows a game forcing hand with a six-card major.  Opener must pass this rebid.

|ht|g|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2dp2hp4hppp|at|
|ht|g|cs|1|at|^O|ia|1np2hp2sp4sppp|at|

|pg||nt|
3.  Responder transfers and then rebids in a new suit.

This shows a game forcing or slammish hand with at least five-cards in the major and at least four-cards in the second suit.  A rebid in a new suit is forcing to game.

This rebid is used to find a five-three fit in the major suit in a game forcing hand.  It should be preferred to a rebid of 3NT when responder holds a weak short side suit.  

A new suit rebid can also be the first move on a slam interest or slam going hand.

Here are two example auctions:
|ht|n|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2dp2hp3cp?|at|
|ht|n|cs|1|at|^O|ia|1np2hp2sp3dp?|at|

In response opener's priority is to show a fit for the major suit.

Without a fit for the major opener can bid 3NT with stoppers in the unbid suits or with a good fit for a minor raise responder's minor suit.

|pg||nt|
3a.  Responder transfers and then rebids in a new suit.

There is one special case of a new suit.

|ht|f|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2hp2sp3h|at|

This sequence shows at least five cards in both majors and is still game forcing.

With a game forcing hand with five-four in the majors you should not transfer instead you start by bidding Stayman and then if a major suit fit has not be uncovered jump in your five-card major:

|ht|p|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2cp2dp3hp?|at|
|ht|p|cs|1|at|^O|ia|1np2cp2dp3sp?|at|

The sequence on the left shows five hearts and four spades.  Opener should raise to 4@h with three card heart support.
The sequence on the right shows five spades and four hearts.  Opener should raise to 4@s with three card spade support.

|pg|nt|qx|Slam|nt|^*BUsing Transfers with a Slam Hand.^*N

Jacoby Transfers can be used as the first response on hands interested in slam.

|ht|g|cs|1|at|^A|ia|1np2dp2hp4np?|at|
|ht|g|cs|1|at|^O|ia|1np2hp2sp4np?|at|

4NT on these auctions is quantitative.  That is it invites opener to bid a slam with a maximum 1NT opening.  The 4NT response shows slam invitational values and a five-card major.

With a fit and a maximum opener can bid six of the major.  Without a fit and a maximum opener can bid 6NT.  with a minimum opener can pass 4NT or correct to five of the major.

Responder can also investigate slam by making a game forcing bid in a new suit.  Once a fit has been established Blackwood and quantitative raise can be used.
