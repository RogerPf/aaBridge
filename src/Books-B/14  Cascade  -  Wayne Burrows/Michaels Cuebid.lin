I would like to tell partner that I have some points and great support for partner's suit.|pg||mb|2H|nt|2@h is also not my style.  With four trumps and a singleton I would raise more strongly.|pg||mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|I am not sure what GIB intended with 2@s.  Some sort of cue-bid with club support I guess.  I would have made this sort of bid on the previous round.|pg||mb|4H|nt|North also emerges from the woodwork with a more aggressive raise that I would recommend on the previous round.|pg||mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|And West finally shows his where he wants to go.  Unfortunately this is a little high.|pg||mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Maybe with two Aces I could double.  It is always worth at least considering a double if you have two Aces and the opponents get to the five level.|pg||pc|DT|pc|DJ|pc|DQ|pc|DK|pg||
