Double shows shorter spades, 2NT more points and there is no five card suit for an overcall.|pg||mb|p|nt|South doesn't have enough strength for game interest or enough spades for a competitive raise.|pg||mb|d|nt|West makes a light double.|pg||mb|p|mb|3S|nt|I am not sure what GIB's cuebid means but it shows a good hand.|pg||mb|p|mb|3N|nt|GIB West thinks East has a spade stopper - I think I would have bid 4@h with these cards.
