With such a good suit I would be tempted to open but it is fair to pass most balanced 11 hcp hands.|pg||mb|p|mb|1H|nt|1@h is not the normal response on this hand.  It is normal to bid your longest suit first.  There are occasions when I would bid a four-card major before a five-card minor but when I have two good suits and game-going values I would keep to the natural order of bidding my longest suit first.|pg||mb|1S|nt|A light overcall but with a reasonable suit it is fair to bid.  Your partner might end up on lead and you would appreciate a spade lead or he might have good spade support and be able to raise you so that you can compete for the part-score.|pg||mb|1N|nt|Having opened light, in competition I would take the opportunity to pass especially since North does not have a spade stopper.  Pass here should say almost the same thing as 1NT - minimum balanced.  Pass is perhaps a little weaker or with no spade stopper.  Here we are both weaker and lack the spade guard.|pg||mb|2S|nt|A normal raise by East with more distribution and four trumps we would consider a jump raise to 3@s.|pg||mb|3D|nt|Now South is forced into a distortion of her hand.  3@d should show five hearts and four diamonds not the other way around.  There is not really any good bid after having initially responded 1@h.  If the initial response had been 1@d then South could double for takeout or bid 3@h naturally either would be a good |pg||mb|p|mb|3H|nt|North also has nowhere to go.  Having shown a spade stopper he cannot rebid No Trumps but is reluctant to go past 3NT to bid 4@c although with East/West bidding and raising spades and looking at @s 1074 it is unlikely that South will be able to bid 3NT.  He gives (very) false preference to 3@h.|pg||mb|p|mb|4H|nt|South should be worried about raising here.  Looking at a singleton spade you should be worried that repeated spade leads will force you to ruff and then if trumps do not break you will eventually end up with fewer trumps than one of the defenders.  South should know that North has at most three hearts.|pg||mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|-|pg||pc|SK|pc|S4|pc|S9|pc|SJ|pg||

pc|DQ|pc|D3|nt|East would have done better here to cover this trick.  Looking at the @d 10 East can see that she might promote a trick.|pg||pc|D4|pc|D5|pg||
pc|D2|nt|East not covering let declarer repeat the finesse.|pg||pc|DK|nt|And playing the King on air did the defense no good at all.|pg||pc|DA|pc|D6|pg||
