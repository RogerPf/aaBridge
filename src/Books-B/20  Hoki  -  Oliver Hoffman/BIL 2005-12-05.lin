Good job, well done. Thanks to all our volunteers. There is not very much to add to the bidding and play here - a gentle hand to start us off?|pg||

East is indeed too weak to open. We really can not count a doubleton Q-J as a full three points. Often a Q-J can be entirely worthless, other times it could be worth a little bit. In actual fact, where East opened the bidding, West went to slam - and failed.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|So it is up to West to start the proceedings - and what better way to do that than with a game bid?|pg||
mb|4H|
at| Who knows, that might even end proceedings at the same time.|pg||
at| In first or second seat a 1@H opening bid is probably better - since if partner has a good spade suit there may be a spade (or heart) slam on. An opening 4@H bid in fourth seat, like here, can hardly be worse - because with less you would open with 1@H and with much less you would pass.|pg||
nt|In most circles, you would probably buy the contract here - as indeed our volunteer West did. However, against experts a 4@H bid is not necessarily likely to shut up the opposition, even if both of them passed on the first round. So let us see North do something about this?|pg||
mb|d|
at| This is, of course, a takeout double. It is hardly logical to double for penalty when you have passed originally.|pg||
nt|Q: Not too weak in points?
A: Yes - too weak in points. But right in shape. A perfect shape. Whatever suit partner bids, we can support. And, using dummy points, our void is worth five points - bringing our total up to 13. Partner has less than 11 (having passed in third seat), so we are still light on points. We hope that we can find a good sacrifice.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|Q: Rdbl is OK then?

A: There is no need for East to redouble - since 4@Hx making is already a good plus score.
From East's point of view, 4@Hx making might be better than the opposition going down, even if doubled. So a redouble is too likely to make sure that N-S do take it out.|pg||
nt|Q: Not for score: for support and good hand, to help partner bid on 5th level against sacrifice.

A: Well that is possible (a double helps West decide), but as I said above maybe we can buy it in 4@Hx; we are most unlikely to buy it in 4@Hxx.|pg||
nt|Well, as they say, takeout doubles are to be taken out. South does this - five points here, five points there, what do points matter?|
mb|5D|pg||
mb|p|
at| West, having described the hand already, passes. There is little point in telling the same story twice. East should be able to decide what to do. Really, on this auction, that must be a forcing pass. East is expected to bid 5@H - or double.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|So the N-S intervention has succeeded in pushing E-W up a level. It does not affect the outcome of the hand at all - but certainly adds some spice to the bidding.|pg||
nt|A diamond lead is probably best - but South hasn't really promised any points.
The @CA lead is okay too, even though we don't normally recommend leading unsupported Aces.
On a hand where the opponents have pre-empted, you could make a case for an Ace lead in order to see dummy before deciding how to continue. On this hand, either approach works.|pg||

A successful finesse would allow 12 tricks (a slam) to be made.
But, in reality, from scratch a slam needs a successful @c or @d finesse as well - so is considerably below par.|pg||

A very interesting auction, I must say. This is a good example of two overbids by West and two underbids by East - looks like a budding partnership because their bids will always compensate each other. West overbid twice (the 2@S bid and the final Double) and East underbid twice (not bidding 3@S over 3@D).|pg||
nt|That first bid by East needs particular attention: With two Aces and so much shape, a jump to 2@S is recommended. Remember that a takeout double forces you to bid. With nothing much, you can of course pass since North has intervened (with 1@D). But I would tend to show a major suit with as little as three or four points. So with 9 points (two Aces plus one length point), I would jump to 2@S whether or not North bid.|pg||
nt|The original Double by West is almost the ideal bid. The hand is short in clubs and has good support for both majors as well as some support in diamonds. After this bid, West really has no more to say since East is aware of exactly this shape and these points (13 to 15).|pg||

nt|On the play, I believe a further @s from West (rather than cashing the high @h) would lead to an extra undertrick. Since the clubs don't run, North-South would be lucky to get out for two down.|pg||
nt|South has a minimum hand and the best South can do is to pass 3@D - and trust partner's position. 3@D is probably also two down - but it's much harder to double that since if it makes North would be scoring up a doubled vulnerable game.
Good try, many thanks to all volunteers.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|
at| When responding after a takeout double, the bids available to responder differ to those if there had been no double: 
  A Redouble is available to show any 10+ points.
  A one-level response is usually forcing for one round.
  And a jump bid shows a weak hand.|pg||
nt|North's choices are: 1@D, 1@H, 2@D - and ?
I might prefer 1@H to 1@D on the theory that we'd like to locate a fit in a major suit. However the disparity in suit length (seven @d vs only four @h) suggests it is better to call @d. Also, West has advertised heart support with the Double. But with a weak hand we want to try and jam the auction, so 2@D is more appealing than 1@D.|pg||
nt|Q: But doesn't 2@H after an X show 5 hearts?

A: Yes. In fact, a jump bid should show at least a six-card suit.|pg||
nt|Up the line is usually right - but not necessarily after a takeout double, and not necessarily with this disparity in suit length, and not necessarily when your hand is so weak that you can only afford to show one suit (in which case prefer a major to a minor).|pg||
nt|Q: If you play criss cross after a minor opening 2@D has a different meaning?
A: Welcome Carol Lee - thanks for mentioning criss cross, which is a (for me) very new convention. Does it apply after interference? (For the rest of you, a "criss cross" bid is, I think, a game force in a minor suit). I would say it does not apply here because of the interference. You can show 10+ points by redoubling.|pg||
nt|So I've got a chocolate fish for what I might bid with the North hand?
Kibitzer: 2@d
A: 2@D shows a six-card suit and a weak hand, less than six points, so let's hear a bit more oomph.
Kibitzer: 3@d 
A: Thanks Don, the chocolate fish is yours.|pg||
nt|It's an extension of the usual SAYC response of jumping one level with a weak hand and a six-card suit. North is actually unlucky to find partner with such little help in diamonds - and wasted honours in hearts. But 3@D can hardly be unreasonable. As I said before, it's very unlikely to get doubled. |pg||
mb|3D|
nt|East of course does not dream of doubling (which wouldn't be penalty anyway - but responsive, showing at least 4-4 length in both majors). With five spades, two Aces, two doubletons, bidding must be the right action to take.|pg||
mb|3S|
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|Note now that all four players have clearly bid their hands well - and to the limit. South opened with a minimum hand and showed the long suit. West made a takeout double, showing 13 to 15 points and @s support. West has no more than that, so there should be no temptation to bid again. North has clearly preempted and bid the hand to the limit (or over the limit). So 3@S becomes the final contract.|pg||
nt|Q: How do you reevaluate hand as takeout doubler's responder (advancer)?
A: As takeout doubler or as partner to takeout doubler you can count dummy points (shortness points): 5 for a void, 3 for a singleton, and 1 for a doubleton. You can not then count length points as well.|pg||
nt|It's a toss up between leading partner's suit (usually the top priority) or leading from your strong club holding. I would go for the @c because partner has shown weakness with the jump. Also, we don't necessarily want a @d ruff since we hope to maybe make one trick naturally. Finally, after seeing dummy it may still be time to switch to @d.|pg||
pc|CA|pc|C2|pc|C4|pc|C8|pg||
pc|CK|pc|CJ|pc|D2|pc|C5|
nt|If we continue @c, declarer can ruff high in dummy. Partner's @d2 effectively denies holding the @dA - it's a discouraging discard. But after high ruff the ten may be high, so best is the @c continuing.|pg||
pc|C7|
at| There is no need to continue with a high club because declarer is going to have to ruff the low club anyway. So a middle card. South really has no preference between a @h return or a @d return, although that should also be pretty obvious to North from looking at dummy.|pg||

A 2@C opening bid shows 9.5 tricks or game in hand. Do we really have that? If the @c loser is half a trick - and the @h is half a trick, then we do indeed have that.|pg||
mb|2C|
nt|With a seven-card suit and a void against a 2@C opener, it looks very much as if opps might be going to slam. So anything to jam the auction might gain us some advantage. The vulnerability is not favourable but we shouldn't be going for more than 500 (2 down) if doubled. So -500 against a game is not a disaster - and against a slam is brilliant.|pg||
mb|3S|
nt|Since South is going to bid again (having forced to game!), there is no need for North to make a bid at this stage. A Double by North would still be basically negative, showing some values. Some play that a Pass might show one or two controls, but I don't recommend that. On a hand like this, South is probably more interested in hearing where North's controls lie rather than how many North has got.|pg||
nt|Q: 3NT shows the stopper?
A: 3NT is a possibility, but I'd like eight or more points to do that because we may well have a slam on. Pass is surely forcing since South's opening bid effectively commits your side to game.|pg||
at|
I hear: What do you reccomend as reply by partner over interference over a 2@c bid?
I play natural - so Pass here with nothing to say.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|
nt|Double would be right if you wanted to hear more from North. 4@H is better because we opened 2@C intending to play in 4@H - so let's follow through with that plan.|pg||

nt|5@S says that we have all the key cards. Do you have the Queen of trumps? North could bid specific Kings. However, since North has denied values by passing 3@S, North can not really have more than the @sA and @hQ. It's not certain that North has the @hQ. However, the 4@S cue bid must promise heart support so N-S have at least 10 trumps.|pg||

Okay, let's award chocolate fish to each part (but if you've got a choc fish already, you're excused - and disqualified).

If you look at the bidding, you will see that South would have been better off just passing 4@S. South has a minimum opening hand - and North hasn't promised more than a minimum opener. By the same token, North could of course have passed 5@S, since likewise North's hand does not hold any extras.|pg||

Vulnerable with only a six-card suit, 2@H is enough.|pg||

South can force to game via 3@D or make a "splinter bid" of 4@H (a jump bid), showing a @h singleton or void with @s support and enough points for game.|pg||
nt|If 3@H had been bid by East, 4@H by South would be a cue bid, showing extra values and looking for slam. It is not, strictly speaking, a "splinter bid" since it is not a jump bid.|pg||

nt|Declarer can see nine tricks (five spades, three Aces, and a heart ruff). The tenth trick will need some luck in a minor suit. Looking at all four hands, the news is not good: both @c honours are off side and the @dK is off side. If this game goes down because of three losing finesses, it would look like succumbing to a 12.5% chance. On top of that, neither minor suit is splitting 3-3, which also would help declarer achieve a tenth trick.|pg||
nt|So it looks like a very unlucky scenario for North to fail in this game contract.
Can anyone see, even with looking at all four hands, how declarer can make the hand?
...
This is a particular kind of safety play. I confess it's a little beyond intermediate level, but I hope you don't mind my demonstrating it here today.|pg||

nt|If East had held the @dK, the @dQ would have been your tenth trick. A @h gives declarer a ruff and sluff (one loser vanishes). A @d sets up dummy's @dQ. So West had to switch to a @c, now East is endplayed. If East had had a third @d, then the suit would be splitting 3-3 and dummy's last diamond would provide a parking place for a @c loser.|pg||
