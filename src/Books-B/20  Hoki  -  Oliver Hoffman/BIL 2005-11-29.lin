nt|Would I double with the East cards?
|pg||
at|
It's certainly a bid worth considering. My partner and I were E-W on this hand - and partner decided to pass.|pg||
nt|What a double has going for it: the vulnerability, the shape of the hand.
|pg||
at|
What is not so nice about a double is: three points in clubs|
hc|cQJ|pg||
at| may not be pulling their full weight, maybe one club too many instead of an extra red card. So it's 50-50.|pg||
nt|Let's say that a double is not wrong, but since it doesn't affect the outcome here I'll just go along with a gentle pass (also not wanting to put my partner off her bidding - since she's sitting in the gallery today).|
lc|cQJ|pg||
at||
mb|p|
nt|A bid of 3@D by South would be my way of checking whether partner has raised to 2@S on three-card or four-card support.|pg||
at| Here, though, South has five spades|
hc|sKT854|pg||
at| so knowing about a fourth spade is not necessary, since we are assured of an eight-card fit.|
lc|sKT854|
mb|3S|pg||

mb|p|pg||
mb|4S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|4@S is a reasonable contract but it may well fail because of the 4-0 trump split.

Q: No Dbl by West?
|pg||
at|
A: NO WAY - please excuse my shouting.|pg||
nt|I double for penalty only when I can see the contract going two down. That way, if one trick gets lost in the wash, we are still okay.
|pg||
at|
I should set up those last two comments as a macro - since I have to make them every week, lol.
|pg||
nt|The idea is that if you can get the opps down, you are heading for a good score anyway.
|pg||
at|
At the same time, a double tells them how to handle the trump suit.
|pg||
nt|West has only two sure tricks - I would need five tricks before I double.|pg||
at|  Even if partner had doubled 2@S, I would play partner for two more tricks, giving us a total of four on defence.|pg||
at| I would not wish to jeopardise a score of +50 in the hope of increasing that to +100 when it risks achieving a result of -590. The simple odds are way against that being a good move.|pg||
pc|HT|
nt|In fact, BBO declarer misplayed the trumps. It was great to see that today's BIL declarer handled the trumps correctly.|pg||
at| I also very much liked our volunteer's opening lead. It's a tough hand to lead from.|pg||
at| A red card looks right - and from three to an honour I would lead small. But it's debatable whether a 10 should be counted as an honour card or not. I feel that a small heart  would really promise a picture card in the suit.|pg||
nt|Our volunteer declarer put too many eggs in one basket by ducking this in dummy.|pg||
at| If West had held four hearts to the @hQ, a small heart lead would have been much more likely. Only if West holds Q-10-9-[x] is the @h10 the right lead.|pg||
pc|HK|
nt|So let's win this one in dummy.
What should East play? We play standard carding.|pg||
at| 
Very, very briefly: high is encouraging and low is discouraging.
|pg||
at|
Come to think of it, that is also the long version.|pg||
pc|H9|
nt|So a high @h (as high as East can afford) says that she likes @h.|pg||
pc|H3|pg||
nt|Our declarer now played the @sA off dummy - and that is always wrong. Whichever way you decide to play trumps, it is mostly correct to start with a small one - playing towards an honour.|pg||
pc|S3|
at|

Our volunteer did that very well here - by leading the @s3 off dummy.|pg||
pc|C2|pc|SK|pc|S2|pg||
pc|C8|
nt|What card should West play?
|pg||
at|Kibitzer: Ace
And why, please?
...
Two reasons for going up with the ace - both lie in the cards partner (East) has played.|pg||
nt|In particular, the @h9 (showing the @hQ) at trick one must work as an encouragement for a heart continuation.
|pg||
at|Then partner has discarded the @c2, so declarer (too) knows that East does not have the @cA.|pg||
pc|CA|pc|C5|pc|C3|
at|
Of course, it looks as if it makes no difference whether we take the ace or not - since declarer now gets a pitch for the losing @h.|pg||

pc|CK|pc|C4|pc|HJ|pc|C7|pg||
pc|D4|pc|D2|pc|DJ|pc|D5|pg||
pc|S4|pc|SJ|pc|SA|
nt|Maybe it's not a good idea for East to discard a @d - but the other options may also backfire.
|pg||
at|With South having pitched a high @h, it's clear that South is now out of hearts. So a @h discard is safe.|pg||
at||
pc|H7|pg||
pc|D7|pc|DA|pc|D3|pc|D6|pg||

nt|Wow, wonderful: 4@S bid and made.
|pg||
at|
Anyway, our declarer made 4@S even by misplaying trumps. When I ducked the club play, it was all over - because the @d10 drops on the third round of @d, making declarer's @d9 a good card.|pg||

nt|2@D is a cue bid - bidding a suit that the opponents have bid should be considered a forcing move. The partner of that bidder must bid again.|pg||

To be fair, I don't think either East or West can make a legitimate penalty double - especially bearing in mind that you'd really like to be sure of defeating the contract by at  least two tricks before you double.|pg||

nt|Hand review...|
mb|1C|pg||
sk|S|
nt|I propagate playing sound overcalls - bidding on hands that are close to an opening bid.|pg||
at|

Remember, it is not easy to lose hands and tournaments by passing.|pg||
nt|The unusual 2NT shows at least 5-5 in the two lower unbid suits (@d and @h). However, those suits should be respectable.|pg||
hc|sKcKJ|
at|  The South hand in play here today has most of its values hidden in the black suits.|pg||
lc|sKcKJ|
at|  2NT might still have been an attractive option at favourable vulnerability. But this is the worst vulnerability imaginable, so the thought of bidding 2NT would not even enter my mind.|pg||
at||
mb|p|
sk|W|mb|1D|pg||
sk|N|
nt|If North wanted to show a weak two-suiter after this start to the auction, the best way if the suits were spades and hearts (the two unbid suits) is via a "sandwich" 1NT overcall -  at least 5-5 in the two unbid suits.|pg||
at|  However, clubs have been bid - so North can not show a two-suiter including clubs.|pg||
nt|Maybe a weak jump overcall of 2@S is the best that North can do.
|pg||
mb|2S|
at|
Once the opponents have bid @c semi-naturally, you can't show six spades and five clubs anymore.|pg||
sk||
mb|2N|
nt|Q: How do you know how good West's diamonds are in order to justify bidding 2NT?
|pg||
at|
A: East's points are all in controls (aces) rather than quacks and spaces.
West has bid 1@D, so East knows that partner can stop diamonds.|pg||
nt|If West has only 6 points, 2NT may only be one down while 2@S is sure to make.
|pg||
at|
If West is very weak with long diamonds, West can retreat to 3@D - so 2NT is not too unreasonable.|pg||
nt|Q: West could have xxx xx Kxxxx Kxx. With xx in diamonds East's 2NT bid looks dangerous?
|pg||
at|
A: As I said, East has key cards (aces) and when bidding under pressure you sometimes have to take a position. If they can make 2S, then one or two down in 2NT should not be a disaster.|pg||
at||
mb|p|pg||
mb|3N|
nt|West has a good six-card suit and raises to game in the hope that the suit will run.
|pg||
at|
Both East and West have stretched marginally to reach this rather thin game. Is it worth the chance when white?|pg||
nt|Well exactly, each undertrick is only 50. So it must be worth going for +400 rather than conceding -140 which is what happened at our volunteer table.|pg||
at|

Risking -100 (two down) must be worth the chance of gaining +400.|pg||
nt|I hear: some of the teachers say in white not worth taking risks in red push as you gain more.
|pg||
at|
That applies when it comes to deciding whether to bid game or not.|pg||
at|
Here it is a question of selling out to 2@S or making one further attempt to win the bidding auction.|pg||
nt|If East had passed 2@S, West would bid 3@D and East might then decide to take the bull by the horns and punt 3NT.|pg||
at||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pg||
nt|Okay, now I hear: I meant the 3NT bid not the 2NT: with 2NT I agree - refers to taking a risk when white against red.|pg||
at|
The six-card suit might mean six tricks - and surely that makes game a dead cert. 
East needs only have the @dJ for six tricks to be solid.|pg||
at||
pc|SK|pg||
pc|S3|pc|S8|pc|S2|pg||
nt|South is out of spades - so must switch. The @cK switch would be diabolical, but on this layout I think declarer can still come home.|pg||

However, a @h continuation is much more natural.|pg||

The chocolate fish goes to Binyamin.|pg||

nt|If you play the @dA (or the @d10) you are assured of four @D tricks. That plus three aces and the @hQ gives you a total of 8 tricks.
|pg||
at|
It is true that you can afford to lose one @d (you only need five @D tricks to make the contract), but you can afford to cater for the actual layout where the suit splits 5-0.|
pc|S4|pg||
nt|Now when North shows out, the situation is clear.|pg||
at|

If this trick had lost to North and the suit had split 4-1, you STILL get the rest of the diamonds - since South's remaining three diamonds all drop under the A-K-Q.|pg||
nt|This way, though, we know now to finesse South for the @dJ safely on the SECOND round of the suit.

Good try - thanks to all volunteers.|pg||
nt|It was interesting to observe the developments at the volunteer table - both in the bidding and play.
|pg||
at|
Starting off by attacking @c on defence made me wonder whether continued @c plays defeat 3NT (the E-W clubs are 3-3).
|pg||
nt|I think after that start that it may need almost double dummy declarer play to allow South to cash @c - and then be endplayed in @h. South needs to find three discards on the run of the @d.|pg||

nt|As West, I prefer to show the shape of my hand - essentially balanced - than rebid the @d. A diamond rebid in my book would tend to show either a sixth @d or a singleton somewhere.|
mb|1N|pg||
at||
mb|p|pg||
nt|While happy with notrumps (a balanced hand), East feels like checking back on whether West mightn't after all have three-card @h support.

"New minor forcing" helps East do that.|pg||
mb|2C@|an|new minor forcing|
nt|Such a bid must be alerted - as it does not necessarily promise a @c suit.
It is forcing on West to bid again.
|pg||
at|
It appears that some tutors in the BIL call the 2@C bid "Checkback Stayman".|pg||
nt|While we are agreed on the meaning (looking for three-card @h support), we disagree as to the terminology. In the US, this is always called "New minor forcing".
|pg||
at|
I think the use of the term "Stayman" is very confusing since we use Stayman to explore for a 4-4 fit in the majors, which is not the case here.|pg||
at||
mb|p|pg||
mb|2D|
nt|2@D now shows the fifth @d and denies three @hs.
|pg||
at|
In fact, West now confirms exactly a doubleton @h because with a singleton West would have rebid 2@D earlier.

D/Trafalgar: No, the "Rule of seven" says to hold up for one round.|pg||
nt|Thanks - you're exhausting my chocolate fish supply but I'd like to hand out three for those answers:|
at|
One to Kasey (for being first - knowing South has no more spades).|pg||
at|
One to Diana for a very good comprehensive reply.|pg||
at|
And one to D/Trafalgar for mentioning the "Rule of seven".|pg||
nt|This rule says that you count your spades and dummy's spades together|pg||

Then you subtract that number from  { 7 }  and that tells you how often to duck.
|pg||
at|
So 6 from 7 leaves one. You duck once.|pg||
lc|sA83976|
sc||
nt|This assumes that the opening leader has started with a five-card suit.|pg||
at|
If North had six @s, it would be even better because South would have had the king singleton - and would now have had to switch.|pg||
at|
If we duck again, we'd need to worry about getting a @c switch and losing lots of @c tricks once the @h finesse fails.|pg||
nt|However, without that knowledge I'd suggest ducking once is enough (and "normal"), so we'll win this trick and take the @h finesse.
|pg||
at|
If the @h finesse (known in Europe as "impass") works, then we can expect to make quite a few overtricks.|pg||

nt|So 3NT made two overtricks, but it's not that easy on a @c switch.
|pg||
at|
Even so, it shows the value of ducking @s once - and noting the need for South to cover the @sQ opening lead.|pg||
nt|Q: What happens if South switches to a club at trick 2?
|pg||
at|
A: I agree that an immediate switch (South could play a @c at trick 2) makes declarer's task much harder.|pg||
nt|DF (Deep Finesse) says 3NT still makes - since South has major discarding problems on the run of the @d suit.
|pg||
at|
I think it's right for South to continue @s - maybe North held @DQ as an additional entry later. Maybe West would duck again?|pg||
nt|So for the sake of partnership harmony, it can not be a gross blunder to continue playing partner's suit.|pg||

nt|I'm over my time allocation anyway, but I am happy to finish off the explanations associated with this deal. It came from a late-night, high-stake team game and was reported by Martin Hoffman.|

nt|This is the sort of hand you might expect East to hold for such a dramatic action.|
mb|4H|
pg||
at|
This is a weak bid, whereas a jump to 2@H is a strong jump shift being almost slam forcing.|pg||
at| The 4@H jump shows at least 7 cards (more usually 8) in @h - and almost no outside strength. It is a preemptive response, trying to keep N-S out of a @s game.|pg||
nt|It doesn't matter whether you are preempting your partner or not. You are describing exactly this sort of hand.
|pg||
sk|S|
at|
Now if West's clubs were hearts (almost impossible), then West is still entitled to explore for slam.|pg||
sk||
nt|We normally don't like to be talked out of games and with such a good hand as this South one, 4@S can't be such a bad contract.
|pg||
at|
Either it makes or is only one or two down, in which latter case 4@H would surely be making.|pg||
mb|4S|pg||
sk||
mb|p|mb|p|pg||
nt|Using the same reasoning as South (either we'll be one down at the five level and 4@S makes - OR we'll make our five-level contract) I'd bid again. As East I would be most reluctant to sell out to 4@S.|
mb|5D|pg||
nt|I hear some comments about 5@H.
|pg||
at|
5@D offers more flexibility than 5@H. Obviously partner (West) has the option to correct to 5@H when that looks right.|pg||
nt|I'm just making this suggestion since I don't believe it's right to let South play unmolested in 4@S.
|pg||
at|
But actually I wanted to come back to our initial 4@S contract, which our volunteer declarer got so close to making.|pg||
ub||

mb|d|
nt|This is NOT my recommendation!
|pg||
at|
Remember, I believe you should have five tricks in your hand before making a penalty double.|pg||
nt|But I'd just like to follow Martin Hoffman's article where in the actual late-night, high-stake game the West player believed a penalty double would work.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|
nt|As East I would still now bid 5@D or 5@H.
|pg||
at|
That is why playing doubles as takeout, even at the four level, is probably a more useful tool than being just purely greedy and wanting blood.|pg||
nt|On this hand, it is East-West's blood that is on the operating table.|pg||
at|  Against 5@D by West, if N-S attack in the black suits, declarer can promote two heart tricks by taking a ruffing heart finesse against South and ruffing three black cards in dummy.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|And this contract should make - or what says DF?
|pg||
at|
Well, DF was right and wasn't.
|pg||
nt|DF was not right because South should have made 4@S (except on double-dummy defence - underleading the A-K of diamonds!!!).
|pg||
at|
DF was right because the declarer blew the play utterly - and went three down for -800.|pg||
pc|DA|
nt|Leading the @dA is what allows the contract to make|pg||
at|, but only someone who can see through the backs of the cards would know that a low diamond to partner's @dQ - and a heart switch is needed to defeat the contract.|pg||

nt|This auction suggests that surely West has the @cK. Our volunteer declarer did very well now to recognise the need to set up clubs in this particular way.|pg||
at||
pc|C8|pc|CK|pc|C3|pc|C2|pg||
pc|D8|pc|D6|pc|DQ|pc|S6|pg||
nt|It is pretty clear to declarer that West is void in @h - because no @h lead or @h switch.|pg||
at|  We should, of course, have pulled one round of trumps earlier - just in case the suit was splitting 2-1.|pg||
at|  Of course, that is just one more reason why making penalty doubles such as this one is not a recommended form of action. It almost screams out to declarer that trumps are splitting 3-0.|pg||
