Typically, 3@D is a 7-card suit, but this is certainly not a suit to bid 4@D even though there are 8 of them
so 3@D or pass -- either is OK with me, 
depends on how disciplined your partner expects for preempts|pg||nt||sk||at|shep:Over the 3@D bid, maspd has a choice betwen 3@S and dbl
For bidding over the 3-level preempt, I'd want a very sound opening bid, and/or a very good suit with a couple of tricks outside
This hand certainly qualifies for a spade overcall if the bid was at the 1-level.
If the bid was at the 1-level, it would be very clear for maspd to overcall 1@S rather than dbl 
- good to get the 5-card major in there|pg||nt||at|shep: But at this level, the 3-level, it isn't so clear and I would like a better suit than this for 3@S, so my choice would be Dbl
If it goes 3@d - dbl - 4@D
2 wee ones has to decide what suit to bid, and the dbl didn't promise 4-4 in majors
I play double here as asking the doubler to help you decide which suit to play
called "responsive double"|pg||nt||at|shep:Now..... I'm not pushing this convention (the responsive dbl), especially as most people don't play it this high
If you don't play the gadget, just bid your stronger suit and hope for the best
KQ: West bids up with 4-4 major, or bids her best major?
shep: best major in this situation
Up the line in situations where you expect your partner to continue with bidding new suits|pg||nt||at|KQ: Woudn't 5@d be a good sacrifice?
shep: I would say not --- 4@S is not necessarily going to make
If NS were going to sacrifice in 5@D, then it would be up to Liz to do it
and she should bid 5@D instead of 4@D if she is going to bid 5@D over 4@S
I think 4@D was the right bid here because liz has a flat hand

up|40|pf|y|at|Shep: As the cards lie, 4@s can be defeated if pet329 switches to @hK at trick 2
But he has no way of knowing that, the club would be my choice too
Tip for the defense:
When declarer draws trumps, eliminates the clubs and then leads a heart from dummy
pet329 should rise with @hK to avoid what happened later when he won the @hK and had nothing but diamonds left 
Even if maspd had a diamond loser left, it would have gone away on the ruff-sluff

(see in discussion)
A 3@s bid is OK and is just competing for the partscore|pg||nt||sk|w|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.^^x|mb|ppp|pg||sk||at|shep: A couple of good discussion points here
pass - 1@s - 2@h is all clear
In SAYC,  a jump to 3@S with babsg' hand would show a limit raise, 3+@s, 10-12 dummy points
That is a very very bad idea|pg||at|
You should use a jump to 3@S in competition to show the hand that babs has
4 trumps, a singleton - just wanting to get in their way|pg||nt||at|You don't always have a singleton but you do always have 4+ trumps and a weak hand, very little defense
You use the 9-card fit to steal their bidding room.
This is incorporated into the 2/1 systems
But could certainly be added to SAYC if you have a partnership to discuss it
It would be helpful here because maspd really doesn't have enough to bid 4@h over 3@s|pg||at|
and liz would not carry on to game
But let's ignore that part for a minute|pg||sk|s|nt||at|shep: 1@s - 2@h - 2@s - 3@h - 
Evaluate liz's hand for play in spades
There are two ways to do this: - HCP + shape|pg||at|    or Losing Trick Count|pg||at|
With unbalanced hands, I prefer LTC
Where you count one loser for each of the top 3 cards in a suit that is not A, K, or Q
So on this hand..... using just that rule (an exception coming)
liz has 5 losers|pg||nt||hc|h6h8|at|2 hearts|pg||hc|d8d6|at|   2 diamonds|pg||hc|cq|at|   1 club
A normal minimum opener is a 7-loser hand with 2.5 Quick Tricks or 6 losers with 2 QT
Now, remember that exception...
Qxx is really 3 losers unless you have the Jack or Ten
So this is really a 7-loser hand with 2 QT|pg||hc|dqhq|pg||nt||at|
Not enough for game opposite a raise to 2@S
Some people count Qxx as 2.5 losers
even so, a 6-loser isn't game unless partner shows a limit raise (10-12 or 8-loser)|pg||lc|dqhqd8d6h8h6cq|nt||at|If the vulnerability was reversed, I'd bid 4@S anyway 
because from liz' point of view they could easily have 4@h
and jumping to 4@S here - they probably won't double
Where if you let them bid 4@h, then bid 4@S as a sacrifice, they are more likely to double
... so this continues a theme from earlier|pg||sk|w|nt||at|If you are willing to go high to take a sacrifice 
- do it as early as possible because that makes it harder for opps to decide what to do
This is actually EW hand for 4@h|pg||at|
I would double 4@S with 2 wee ones' hand:
15 hcp - pard's 3@h was forward-going ..... sounds like they are stealing
By forward going, I mean 3@h is an invitation to game, rather than just competing for the part-score
Sometimes they'll make it ...... but sometimes they'll go down 2, more than our game is worth|pg||sk|n|nt||at|shep: The 2@S bid had only 2 HCP ..... but it is just right to raise
Nothing to do with sayc or 2/1 ..... except, that if you can have the agreement that the jump raise is weak
3@S is a better bid than 2@S
but passing - just plain wrong|pg||sk|e|nt||at|maspd: Could the 3@h also have been a LOTT bid? 
shep: I guess so, but 1@s - 2@h - 2@s - 
3@h is the only way to raise hearts below game
Even if you play a cue bid = limit raise, it wouldn't apply here, because 3@S is going to force to 4@h
So I would expect the raise to 3@h to have a defensive trick
because it is the only way to raise|pg||at|
If you had a way to invite that was lower than 3@h, then the 3@h bid instead would be just competitive

2 wee ones has a clear lead - a high diamond

So maspd does not have @DQ or a doubleton diamond - or she would encourage|pg||at|
If dummy had a source of tricks, where diamonds could be discarded, then you might cash the other high diamond anyway
....but 2 wee ones controls clubs
So best is to switch, rather than set up declarer's @DQ|pg||nt||at|This is the biggest part of defense
... being careful with your signals, and following partner's suggestions unless you see how the alternative clearly works
2 wee ones:  I was worried about a void

several asked about cdt's decision to open 2@S with 4 hearts
It is almost always wrong to do that, BUT
if I was ever to do so, this would be the hand
look at those  spades!
oh my...|pg||nt||at|shep: If pard has @hAKxx      you're probably still best playing in spades rather than hearts
so let's say 2@S is fine
Now, what should Jane do?
Spades might be playable if they're really strong
I wouldn't look for a heart fit|pg||nt||at|Cliff228: 2@s says "no outside defensive trick"
shep: Cliff, that is just not true
Whoever told you that is mistaken
A 3-level preempt should not have a side Ace or King, although most people ignore that rule too
But a weak 2 opening is a cross between that 3-level defensively weak preempt and an opening bid
a weak 2 = a good six card suit, and may include a side honor
In SAYC, the way to find out the quality of the weak 2 is to bid 2NT asking for that feature|pg||nt||at|shep: Essentially, if you can count on a decent suit for the weak 2
when opener has a side feature, he has a maximum
What I would have done with Jane's hand is to ask for that feature
....not that you care where it is
But if pard has a feature, he'll have closer to 10 points than 6
Here, cdt would bid 3@S = no feature, and I'd pass that|pg||nt||at|shep: Someone asked "Should you open a weak 2 with a void?"
Ideally not
But if I had @SAQJ1098  @hxxx @d-  @Cxxxx
that's a weak 2 bid in spades
I am stricter about voids for 3- and 4-level preempts
Those bids should not have defensive strength
and a void is defensive|pg||nt||at|007santa:  When would you pass with 4 of the other major?
shep: I almost never open a weak 2 with a 4-card major on the side
This quality of suit = 5 solid winners, is the turning point
The danger of opening a weak 2 with a side 4-card major is that you might miss game when you'd bid it 
if you had the better fit

up|33|pf|y|at|shep: Let's look at the plan from declarer's point of view
@C3 lead with @C7 winning in dummy
So start by counting the top tricks - those we can take without a finesse, split, or losing the lead
We have one club trick in .... add 1 spade and 1 heart
So we need 6 more tricks
We can establish 3 more in clubs by driving out @CA|pg||nt||at|shep: We might establish one more in spades via a finesse
More than that is unlikely in spades because of entry problems
But the heart suit might give us two more if they split 3-2 and if the @hK and Q are divided or both in atrump's hand
Can't work on clubs at trick 2 because dummy is out..|pg||nt||at|shep: So I'd work on heart next
Cashing @SA was a mistake - you need that entry later to take a second heart finesse
Win @C7, play @h to J or 10, losing to @hK
- firsty will probably switch to @DJ ..... that gets won in hand, and declarer knocks out @cA
If another diamond is played ...... now take stock
You have 1 spade, 1 heart, 2 diamonds, 4 clubs = 8 tricks|pg||nt||at|shep: Your best chance for 9 now is a @S to the @SA
followed by a second heart finesse
This gives you 9th trick if one or both of the heart honors is in atrump's hand, a 75% chance
Everything pretty much as jane played, except not cashing @SA at trick two - you need that entry for later
Jane01:  I was surprised to be in dummy so early!

KQ:  Should W redouble instead of bidding 2 clubs?
shep: After 1@d - dbl - cdt does have a choice between Rdbl and 2@C   
Both are technically correct
As a passed hand, I would not bid 2@C on a 4-card suit because partner might pass => 2@c is flawed
It is close between Rdbl and raising diamonds (third option)|pg||nt||at|shep: You like to have five diamonds to raise to 3-level since pard might have 3
....but that's fairly uncommon|pg||at|
XX is usually a hand that is interested in doubling them
and since cdt is weak in both majors, that's not a good choice this time|pg||nt||at|Tactically, I think 2NT (diamond raise 10+ ) is best|pg||at|
Now...... someone said "thought rdbl implies no fit"
Redouble implies you don't have enough of a fit to raise|pg||nt||at|shep: In a major, rdbl would usually deny 3
But in a minor, you need 5 to raise to 3-level, so ..... rdbl denies 5
Someone asked "assumming they are bidding 2/1 what does redbl mean ? "
This has nothing to do with 2/1 for a few reasons:|pg||nt||at|
1. cdt is a passed hand - can't force to game|pg||at|
2. 2/1 game forcing is off in competition of any kind|pg||at|
3. I believe 2/1 GF should apply ONLY to major suit opening bids where you have a forcing 1NT response for the 10-12 hands|pg||nt||at|KQ: Should Jane open this hand?
Jane is in 3rd seat and this is 100% clear to open
I wouldn't open in 1st or 2nd
In 3rd seat you need a good reason to pass
KQ: Should cdt open?
I open balanced hands with 12 HCP .... I'd open AK/A in a flash if unbalanced, ...but I'd pass this|pg||nt||at|KQ: Can third seat open with 10?
shep: 3rd seat can open if they have a reason i.e. 
If they have a good lead to suggest
Or if they have spades and might win the partscore battle
So not really a matter of points|pg||nt||at|KQ: After N makes free bid could S raise hearts?
shep: No, he could not. The raise by the doubler shows extra values
Also, I challenge the idea that atrump's bid is a "free bid"
A "free bid" implies that one needs extra values because you are risking a new suit
Here, the dbl promises 3 suits
And 2@h is more like a raise than a free bid
I would bid 2@h with as little as @hKxxxx and out.....when in doubt, raise|pg||nt||at|KQ: Should atrump rebid the hearts over 3@D because there are 5?
shep: No.... bid 3@h if you have good shape or good concentration of values in your suits .... 
Here, @DJ and @CQ...those minor honors in their suits are suggestions not to bid
Well.... actually, having passed the first time, firsty can go to 3@h
But not because of LOTT - atrump's 2@h did not promise 5|pg||nt||at|I wouldn't go to 3@h because firsty has a bare minimum takeout dbl with no great shape
Maybe pard risked the farm to push them from 2- to 3-level, now I'm going to offer -500 by going to 3-level?  
Don't think so   
Against 3@h-X they take:  @CAK, @C-ruff, 2 diamonds, @SA = 500

How should the bidding have gone?|pg||nt||at|shep: This is a reasonable auction.
But if I was bidding all 4 hands it would be as above|pg||ub|8|mb|2np3dppp|pg||nt||at|One last note on the 2NT diamond raise after X:
1@d-X-3@d now becomes preemptive (be it clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades)
After a X you are better off to use XX for a hand that has 10+ and tends to deny a fit,
and so the widespread use of 2NT as a conventional way to show a limit raise.
Without a double, 1@d-2NT = 13-15 in sayc unless a passed hand, then 11 to a bad 12
(but many changed 1@c/@d-2NT to be an invitational hand, discuss with your P)

up|36|pf|y|at|shep: firsty has a bad hand to lead from .... Just because pard bid hearts doesn't promise the @hK, so leading or underleading @hA is not recommended
A trump was chosen, I would suspect because the other options were not great
But here's the scoop:|pg||at|
Don't think: "When in doubt, lead trumps"|pg||at|
Think: ^*B"If any doubt, don't lead trumps"^*N
Don't lead trumps unless the auction clearly says that's the right thing to do|pg||nt||at|shep: I would worry about a trump lead here because dummy will often have 5 clubs, and firsty has @C109x
If clubs are going to set up to provide discards, then it is important to get our side tricks set up right away
Try to picture the dummy before you lead
Here, I'd take the risk of leading spades - (might lose a trick if I lead into @sAQ)
because there is an indication that we have to get our tricks going early - or lose them|pg||nt||at|shep: Here, with a spade lead - when declarer gives up a club trick to set up discards, 
the spades are ready to cash - 
defense can take 2 spades, 2 hearts and @CQ
From @SKJ103 the standard lead is J, top of interior sequence|pg||at|
Someone asked if I like coded 9's and 10's  J denies
Personally, I prefer standard - I think the coded leads give declarer too much info
But that is just a personal preference - whatever works for you is what you should play|pg||nt||at|shep: OK, back to declarer's problem
There is a legitimate play for 3 club tricks here
A simple finesse
But the way to finesse is not to lead the Jack
That only worked because firsty had @C109x|pg||nt||at|shep: And the 109 fell, setting up dummy's 7
Certainly not a 50-50 shot
The way to take a finesse in clubs for 3 winners is to lead small towards @CJ
If atrump has the @CQ    you will get A, K, J    although you may lose to the @CQ first
When you go to finesse think:|pg||at|
^*B"lead small towards big"^*N
And only lead an honor card if it is clearly to your advantage to have that card covered|pg||nt||at|shep: Here, most of the time, if S has @CQ she covers and that sets up their 109x(x)
"Lead small towards big" - might be tip of the day :)|pg||at|
I hadn't looked at the whole hand to see if Jane should take the club finesse - actually should not do so on this hand, 
I was referring just to the technique

You would not want to bid 7@h missing the trump king
So, let's look at the bidding
msphola:  should I have just bid 2@H over his 2@C?
shep: There are lots of ways of responding to 2@C opening
For some, 2@D is negative or waiting, for them, a 2@h response promises at least 5 with 2 of the top 3 honors 
(some include 6 with 3 of top 5)|pg||nt||at|shep: But in either case, a better heart suit than this
The reason to do it that way is if opener has an unbalanced hand, then you want to give him max room to describe
and 2@D keeps it low|pg||at|
If opener has a balanced hand, he'll bid NT and then responder can use Stayman and Transfers 
to find the spot after 2@c : 2@d : 2nt|pg||nt||at|shep: What 2NT range shows depends on how you play 3NT opening bid
Let's say 2NT opener is 20-21
2@c then 2NT is 22-24
3NT opener is 25-27
2@c then 3NT would be more than that (getting off the scale soon)|pg||at|
If 3NT opener is gambling
Then this hand would be 2@c : 2@d : 2NT
All a matter of partnership|pg||nt||at|shep: Let's assume for this partnership that 2@c-2@d-2NT was the right option, showing 25-27
Now 3@D is a transfer and msphola wasn't sure what to do next after 3@h
The right action is 4@C
After the transfer responder's next bid is a 2nd suit
You're still looking for the right trump suit....so 4@C = 4+ clubs
Over that, paragjoshi is supposed to pick a trump suit|pg||nt||at|shep: He'd bid 4@h
He doesn't know how strong pard is
Over 4@h, msphola can ask for key cards
3NT is a mistake on this auction, it could be passed 
That is why I would bid 4@C|pg||nt||at|2@c-2@d
2NT-3@d    (transfer) 
3@h-4@c    (2nd suit) 
4@h-4NT    now blackwood and 6@h

KQ: Can 2NT be passed?
shep: yes, 2NT can be passed....but quite unlikely

This pair plays 2/1 game force
So 2@h showed 5+ hearts and enough values for at least game
There are different ways to play after that|pg||nt||at|I play that a new suit at the 3-level shows extra values, just as it does in sayc 
Called a "high level reverse" it shows 15+
(mm: also referred to as "Lawrence style")
If you play that way, then sally rebids 2@S with this hand
And that 2@S rebid does not promise 6, just says she can't make a more descriptive call
It is the "catch-all" rebid|pg||nt||at|
shep: Others play that 2@S promises 6
And for them, 3@D doesn't show extras

This isn't a matter of right/wrong - but just very important to know what partner expects|pg||nt||at|
I like 3@D to show extras because when it goes 
1@s-2@h-3@d      If responder does not have spades, but does have a club stopper
she must bid 3NT regardless of strength, or risk missing the obvious game
Since 3@D takes up so much bidding room, I like to have it show extras, 
so responder knows if there is a slam chance or not right way.

up|40|pf|y|at|shep: @CK is the stand-out lead although a diamond lead holds to 5 
- no way to know that
When declarer wins @cA and leads @S10
paragjoshi has to decide whether or not to cover
That should be decided before he plays a club to the first trick, 
so you don't give the situation away by thinking about it when @S10 led|pg||nt||at|shep: I would cover this time because:
No easy entry for declarer to repeat the finesse
and then get back to dummy to run the hearts
Usually, I don't cover unless I'm sure it is setting up spot cards for my side, not theirs|pg||at|
But that's a key factor here|pg||nt||at|shep: If the spade is covered
then declarer should win, cash the other high spade
and run the hearts
Eventually paragjoshi will trump in with the high spade, and then the @S9 will be entry to the rest of the hearts|pg||nt||at|KQ: Could you clarify the "usually I don't cover" please
shep: With @SQJx over @S109x
I will usually play low on the 10 lead and make declarer guess
He may not be going to finesse
and my pard might have @SK singleton|pg||nt||at|shep: But here, because of the lack of entries outside hearts, 
I would make declarer use up a dummy entry if she wants to finesse again


shep: Thank you all for coming - the BIL is near and dear to me

You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
