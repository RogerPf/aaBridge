sv|o|nt|Board 1: opening 4333 hands; lead from xxxx |pg||
mb|p|nt|Some might open the N hand, but I tend not to open bad 12 point hands. What makes this one bad is the 4333 shape, and the unsupported @CQxx. You can use a program called K&R Hand Evaluator to see what hands are worth ... it is at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi. K&R says this hand is worth 11,50|pg||
mb|1N|nt|You can apply the same standards to the East hand, taking away a point for the 4333 shape, but the East hand also has some positive features, like the 2 Aces and 2 Kings, with the only Jack supported by the AK. KR says this one is worth 15,10, so I'd open 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|By the way ... don't use this during the game ... afterwards, it is useful to see how you did with your hand evaluation.|pg||
mb|p|nt|I would not raise with the West hand. Some 8 point hands are worth more than others. This is particularly bad because 7/8 points are in short suits, and the long suits are weak. KR gives this one 5,25. If you do decide to raise with the West hand, you should use Stayman first to look for a 4-4  spade fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|What card to lead?|pg||
pc|H5|nt|My choice of opening lead is a heart. Although my diamonds are a little stronger, I'd opt to lead the major... At least there will never be 5 hearts in dummy, while there might be 5 diamonds. From a weak 4- or 5-card suit, I prefer to lead second highest. That way, when I lead a small spot, partner can count on me for an honour. However, before you do so, you should discuss your leads with your partner.|pg||
nt|Declarer's plan:
You should start off by counting your top winners, the ones you can take without losing, or possibly losing the lead. With the lead, we have 1 heart, 3 diamonds and 2 clubs = 6 We have a chance to set up more tricks in clubs, one if N has @CQ and another if clubs are 3-3. Something to watch out for is the blocked tricks in diamonds.|pg||
nt|If we use @dKQ as entries to play clubs, we might strand the @DA and if we unblock the @DKQ before leading towards our !CAKJ, we won't have an entry to the 4th club. Since noone bid, I'll assume the hands are fairly balanced, and take a chance on the @DA ... hope someone has to lead to it at the end.|pg||
pc|H7|nt|Today's game is MP scoring ... pairs as it is scored at your local duplicate club. Overtricks are as important, if not more so, than making the contract.|pg||
pc|HT|nt|North should play @h10. If East has the King, he's entitled to a trick, and if he does not the @h10 will win. However, if East has the King and North plays the Ace, then declarer gets 2 heart tricks.|pg||
pc|HK|pg||
pc|CA|nt|I'd cash one top club first, in case there is a singleton @CQ, cross the @DQ and take a club finesse|pg||

pc|D3|pc|D5|pc|DQ|pc|D2|pg||
pc|C4|pc|C9|pc|CJ|pc|C6|pg||
pc|D8|nt|So we have 4 tricks in, and can take 2 more in diamonds and 1 more in clubs = 7. We would do that by playing to @DK and then to @CK and cashing @DA. If we cash the @CA first, and then to @DK, we make 7 only if the clubs split. Since the @CJ won, I'll make sure of my tricks, and hope for an extra trick in the end game... maybe South has @hA.|pg||
pc|D4|nt|East does not know who has the @DJ ... at least he thinks it is South, because S played high-low showing an even number of diamonds, but he isn't sure ... not always a good idea to trust opps' signals.|pg||

nt|Board 2: strong 2@c; negative or waiting 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Nice hand, 23 HCP, worth more because of the great 6-card club suit. KR says 25,5. Definitely worth 2@C opener.|pg||
nt|You could treat the West hand as a balanced hand, but I would not do so... this is a very strong playing hand in clubs, and bidding NT now gives up your chances at 6 or 7 clubs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|In SAYC, the technically correct bid is 3@D = positive response with diamonds... but i insist that it is a terrible bid! Responder to the strong 2@C should stay out of the way, leaving partner room to show his hand.|pg||
nt|If opener has a balanced hand, he can bid NT to show a range of points, and then you can use Stayman and Transfers to find the right spot. And if he has an Unbalanced hand, your points will only be useful if they're in pard's long suits. I like to play that 2@D is "Negative or Waiting". If East's diamonds were long and strong, bid 3@d over 2@c.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|3NT says you have some points, although not exactly how many. If you play 2@D is "Negative or Waiting" then the cheapest 3-level bid (here 3@D) is a second negative saying you're very weak.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|West can pass 3NT, but won't with this hand. 4NT is an invitation to slam. You only use Blackwood when you have a fit agreed. Now, that's a pretty losely defined invitation, since East's points are not well defined, but, I'd say this is enough to give it a try.|pg||
nt|For the 3@C then 4NT bid, I'd expect a stronger hand than if West rebid 2NT after 2@C : 2@D : 2NT, which would show 22-24 in SAYC.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|As the cards lie, you can make 7@C or 7NT but, it depends on a 3-3 club break, which is only about a 35% chance.|pg||
nt|South has a terrible hand to lead from :< Against 6NT, you want to find the safest lead possible. It is nice to have something like J1098 or QJ109. No such luck here, so I'd lead dummy's suit: the clubs are likely to be long and pretty well solid, so the lead won't give anything away.|pg||
pc|C3|nt|Declarer's plan:
Top tricks are 2 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds, 3 clubs = 10. We can set up 3 more in clubs if that suit breaks 3-3 or 2 more if clubs break 4-2 (more likely). Also, a chance at another trick if @hJ falls in 3 rounds. My plan would be to lead clubs from the top, checking the break. Once everyone follows to 2 clubs, you are sure of the contract.|pg||

nt|6NT making 7 is worth about 80% of the MP. Any grand slam is a bad contract ... they all need a 3-3 club break. Your grand slam contracts should be closer to 75% than not at MP scoring NT outscores clubs, so that is why I'd invite 6NT with the W hand.|pg||

nt|Board 3: opening 4-4 minors; takeout double; lead from xxxxx; shift|pg||
mb|1D|nt|The S hand has some flaws, like @hKQ doubleton ... but also some plus factors, like the @d109 so I'd open. There is some debate as to which suit to open with 4-4 minors. Traditional wisdom is to open 1@D, so that if you must you can rebid clubs. Modern style is to open 1@C, since you won't rebid a suit anyway, but will bid NT.|pg||
nt|Some top expert partnerships deliberately have no agreement, so they can do what feels right at the time, and their opps won't have an inference about minor suit length when they play 3NT. KR says this one worth 11,95. I open 1@D, so that if it goes 1d - 1s - dbl -, I can rebid 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|West should pass, hand not strong enough for a takeout dbl, and hearts not good enough for overcall.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|In SAYC, the raise to 2@D shows 6-9 or a bad 10 dummy points. This is worth about 9: you can count something for the doubleton club, but not the Queen as well. Another alternative is 1NT = 6-9 or bad 10 with no major but I don't like 1nt with @sxxx and @hAxx, those are not "good lead values". If partner has Queens or Jacks in those suits, better to play the NT from his hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Why doesn't East bid with 11 points? The answer is that East has 3 diamonds. Balancing is all about shape, not points.|pg||
mb|p|nt|S has no reason to bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|but now W should Dbl. The opps have a fit, increasing the chances that your side does as well, and it is very important to push them up a level when they find their fit and settle at the 2-level. West has already passed, and so he can show his shape now without his partner getting carried away. If West has few HCP, that's OK his partner will have a little more.|pg||
nt|The idea when it goes 1x p 2x p p ... both sides have about half the points so it is the player who is short in their suit who must bid ... that way if they're in a 4-3 fit, you can leave them there. I would do this (West's Dbl) at any vulnerability and any scoring except rubber bridge chicago style. It is just a losing proposition to let them have the 2-level in their 8+ fit.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Now, North's question is: is he willing to defend vs. 2@h or 2@s, or will he compete to 3@D over them. If you are willing to compete to 3@D, you should do so immediately, don't give them the 2-level to find their fit, and then the 3-level to decide what to do. With what is most likely a 9-card or more diamond fit, I'd bid 3@D right away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Note that East has no trouble passing this... The whole point of West's double was to push the opps to the 3-level, once that is accomplished, the bidding is done. If North had passed, East should bid @2h, cheapest 3-card major, giving them lots of room to keep on bidding. You could bid 2@S, as your better major, but I wouldn't go to the 3-level to try my Jxxx suit. What you're really hoping is that they'll bid again. So whatever you do, don't sit and squirm, and sigh, and look like you wish you didn't have to bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pg||
pc|H7|nt|This is an example of why I like to lead differently from xxxx or xxxxx than Qxxx or Qxxxx. Watch and see...|pg||
nt|Declarer's plan:
Losers are 3 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 club. Since dummy has more trump than declarer, count the losers from his hand. You can discard a spade on the @hA, if you can get there before they cash spades.|pg||
pc|H2|pc|H9|pc|HK|nt|South wins the @hK,|pg||
pc|DT|nt|and plays a diamond. If East returns a heart declarer wins, pulls trump ending in dummy, and discards a spade on @hA.|pg||
nt|Several have suggested unblocking the @hQ and playing low to @CQ in case they make a mistake, and don't cash spades. I think if you unlblock the @hQ and play a club that then West should find the spade switch. If you don't unblock @hQ, then it will be much harder for West to find a spade switch from the @SAJxx.|pg||
pc|D3|pc|D2|pc|DA|pg||
pc|SK|nt|However, since W led @h7 = high spot card, East can figure out who has @hQ and knows there is no future there.|pg||

mc|8|nt|Now declaerer can pull the rest of the trump, but must lose a club trick, down one. +50 is worth 80% for EW.|pg||
nt|Someone asked about passing the hand out. If S doesn't open, that's the likely result. That will be bad for NS since they usually go plus here, with better than half the points. -50 is the par result but more often than not, NS were allowed to make 3@D for 110.|pg||

nt|Board 4: response with 5HCP and an Ace; 5-4 hands; defense|pg||
mb|1S|nt|N has a good 12 points, but nothing to bid: wrong shape for takeout dbl, and no suit worth 2-level overcall.|pg||
mb|p|nt|East has only 5 HCP, but should respond. An Ace is worth more than 4. I don't like to open 2x with 2-suited hands, so my regular pards and I will almost always respond to a 1-level opener if we have an Ace.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|It is a mistake for W to pass 1NT. 5-4 hands play, on average, 2 tricks better in a suit than in NT. That means, if you can make 1NT (90) you will make 110 in clubs, or possibly 110 or 140 in spades. 140 in spades is unlikely, since you'll have at most a 7-card fit there.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|If you play SAYC, this sequence absolutely denies 3 spades: at most a doubleton preference. With 6-9 and 3+ spades, raise right away.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Now, N has 12 HCP, and remember what I said earlier about not letting them have the 2-level?|pg||
mb|p|nt|He should pass this time for two reasons:
 1. he is long in their suits;
 2. they probably don't have an 8 card or better fit.
but mostly because of number 1.
Balancing (bidding after 2 passes when they stop low), is all about shape, not points.|pg||
nt|Not an easy hand to lead from for N. Against this auction, your best lead is usually a trump, especially when you have clubs protected. But, leading from J10xx isn't great.|pg||
pc|D8|nt|I think i'd go for @D8 this time and see if I can find some of partner's points. I just can't make myself lead a spade from J10xx. If I lead low, declarer might win the 9. If I lead J or 10, and partner has singleotn or doubleton honour, we might lose 1-2 tricks that way.|pg||
nt|Declarer's plan:
Losers are 0-1 spade, 1-2 hearts, 1 diamond, 3-4 clubs. Natsy spot. I think West's best chance is to try for a club ruff in dummy. Hope they don't switch to spades.
I'd duck the first diamond, however, since I'll need a diamond ruff back to hand if I'm going to ruff a club. Can't use spades to get there.|pg||
pc|D2|pc|DQ|pc|D4|pg||
pc|S2|nt|However, South is not fooled, he's going to play a spade.|pg||
pc|SQ|pc|S3|pc|S5|pg||
pc|DJ|nt|Once they figure out to play spades, no chance of a club ruff, so I'd hope to get out for down one via taking 5 spades, 1 diamond and 1 heart.

nt|Board 5: no trumps; signals; discards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|With no 4+ major, W should just bid 3NT. The West hand worth 11 points, 1 for the 5-card suit, so definitely worth 3nt. But, I always go to game with any hand worth 10 points, 15 and 10 is enough to give you a chance, usually. The vulnerability is not a factor.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|From @hQJ9xx, the @hQ lead is a clear cut choice. If you have @hQJxxx with no 10 or 9, then vs. NT you should lead 4th best.|pg||

Winners are 2 spades, 2 hearts, and 2 clubs = 6. So we need at least 3 more. Those can come from clubs if clubs split 2-2 or the @CQ singleton falls.
