sk|n|mb|p2N|at|BSeagram: well jacquiek, what sayest thou now????

Burloak, your partner has just said she has 12-14 HCP
Whenever you have 15-17 HCP and a balanced hand, you MUST open 1NT
If you fail to do so, partner will know you do NOT have 15-17 HCP and balanced hand
whatever you do next will be either an underbid (as here) or an overbid ( 1@h-2@d-3NT = 18-19). Let's undo the bidding|

BSeagram: Good lead (Opening lead...top of sequence, best lead in bridge)
margaritah: Don't  you  use  transfer  to  minor?
BSeagram: Minor suit transfers should be used when you have a weak hand or a slam hand
You want to be in 5 of a minor only once a year

BSeagram: We must all learn the rule of 40
there are 40 HCP in deck
Assume NS have 26 HCP in 3NT approx
West had 12 HCP 
=> that leaves only 2 possible points and max 3 HCP in the East hand. We already saw the @cJ|

up|24|sk||
at|BSeagram: NOW West cashed 3 high hearts
and NOW down one legitimately
Does everyone see why leading a heart was right, not a spade and not a diamond?
Count the points that declarer and dummy have together...3NT = approx 26 HCP...4 of a major: approx 24 HCP plus some distribution points
Then add your points, that tells you how many partner can have
URGENT that you do this when defending every single hand|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||
at|moonjohn: how do you show your 5 card major if you open 1NT?
BSeagram:  You don't worry about the 5 card major
The rebid is the most important thing
If you start with anything other than 1NT, you have NO rebid
You can learn Puppet Stayman to uncover 5 card majors...one day|

nt||
at|BSeagram: And declarer should be drawing trump now!
Karen, tell me how you felt about pulling trump or what made you nervous about that?
Karen10: I knew the @hAce out, was waiting for spade ruffs, desperately wanted to get rid of a spade and assumed the worst :(
BSeagram: Why? The bridge Gods often do not deal you the Ace of trump and yet we have to take the trump away from the bad guys whenever possible.
By then you will have pulled one round and S will  not (you hope) have another trump|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|
BSeagram: And played this way, now you should make your contract. So let's back up to the start of trick 2 |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||
up|8|sk|n|
at|BSeagram:  Here's how it should all go: 
We are working on defense (mm: mouse over trick 1 will show you cards played)
South leads @s3. North  does not know  if it is a singleton or if South has led with 3 of them
HOPES for a singleton.
BUT... North knows that if he wins @sAce (THIRD HAND HIGH!!) (1) and gives partner a ruff (2) and later gets @hAce (3) 
for North, that is only THREE tricks
It's URGENT that we BEAT this contract|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|
BSeagram: N has something very special
A magic ingredient in his hand
Ace Trumps
That is called having control of trump
Whenever you have Ace and another trump OR Kxx trumps
you should think of leading SHORT suits|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|
BSeagram: WE LOVE leading short suits, singletons and doubletons
Eddie Kantar says: We love leading short suits and would lead a void if we could
jacquiek:  so I should win the ace and lead @d, I know it's not a doubleton cause I saw the 2
BSeagram: Yes, but it could be three cards
Now N, repeating....If you give South a ruff in spades and then get Ace hearts it does not beat the contract|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|
BSeagram: So you have to think about leading your own short suit
then BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONTROL OF TRUMP (Ace Hearts) you will get in fast|

BSeagram: Now give S a ruff in @S
BUT URGENT that you tell her what to lead back
Lead a HIGH spade.
That says: lead back the HIGHER RANKING of the two remaining suits
out of clubs and diamonds, Diamonds are HIGHER ranking|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |

was obvious but have to keep hitting partner over the head

BSeagram: With all hands visable a note on the bidding
Do either of you East West's play splinters?
Of course you would have both had to agree to be playing this
That would have been a fabulous description of West's hand
If you do not play splinters, then Jacoby 2NT|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|
Splinters: 1@H - 4@C would show 13-15 points including distribution and 4 card support for major
It is EASY on these hands to get to game
Splinters allow you to often get to slam with only 26 points because of magic shape
As it turns out, E will not be enchanted by the 4@C bid and will bid 4@H only|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|
If you were playing only Jacoby 2NT, W would bid 2NT in response to opener's 1@H bid showing 13 OR MORE points (no limit) and 4 card support for major
E would then bid 4@H as she has no singleton and has only a  minimum
If playing neither convention, then the bidding was perfect as it was|

Low because you, north can see all the spots below the @d7
