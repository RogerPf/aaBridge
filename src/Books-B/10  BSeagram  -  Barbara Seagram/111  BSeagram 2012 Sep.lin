When I use CAPS everyone, it is only to emphasize. Many in cyberspace deem that to be shouting. I am NOT shouting!!!

Shall we start? One more thing before we start auction
When you are decalrer in a NT contract, it is imperative that you count your winners
Your SURE tricks that will win without losing the lead|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  Declarer, you may not CASH your sure tricks until you have worked on your PROJECT suit
You will NEVER (almost never) have enough winners
Therefore you have to have a project suit in which you can get more tricks. Attack that suit (usually) in NT FIRST before cashing a bunch of sure tricks. Those are dessert. Have to have main course (spinach) first
OK, away we go|

BA1, your rebid of 1NT said you have 12-14 HCP and not a penny more
IF you had 15-17 HCP and a balanced hand you would have opened 1NT|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |

bseagram:  Nome, if North had only 12 HCP, that would get ugly playing in 3NT?
You ought to have bid 2NT next, that would have been better. Your 1@D bid was 100% correct
nome: in my defense I counted at least 5 good tricks for the partner :(
bseagram:  I LOVE enthusiasm!|

BA1 what might you have considered opening?
BILAssist1: I considered NT but I thought to go by the 1@C opening...   
bseagram:  Whenever you have 5-3-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 or 4-4-3-2 and 15-17 HCP, you have to always open 1NT|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  If there is a suit in which you have something that makes you nervous, take valium but still open 1NT
As your rebid later otherwise will always be either an underbid or an overbid
 
Can we back up the auction?|

Whenever you own the next door neighbours in a suit in which you are finessing, always lead the honour card. 
That way if it wins, you are already IN DUMMY to lead again|

up|40|at|Lets back up to trick 4 where East is on lead.
bseagram:  East has a HUGE clue on this hand...she knows that West cannot have the @sJ 
She knows that becase we always play THIRD HAND HIGH, right?
BUT when you are trying to win a trick and have more than one touching honour, you must win with the bottom one.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  thus if west had Q and J spades, she would have HAD to play J when winning (or trying to win)
By playing the Q, she says " I swear I do not own the J".
SO, in that case, who has the Jack?
North does, SO, by continuing with a spade, you are giving declarer a trick
East has to get west on lead to lead a spade for you through declarer's spades|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  Tell me what suit you think MIGHT get her on lead
When you cannot work out what to lead, work out what NOT to lead
- cannot get p on lead with a @D (dummy has golden diamonds!)
- Not a @s cuz you know declarer has the J. Not @c because declarer attacked that suit so it is declarer's project suit|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  Confusius say both sides lead same suit, somebody crazy
so you pray that P has the ace of @H. If west does not lead back a @s, you get a new partner
Lead the @h9 (top of nothing)
(if you lead @h3, it says you have something good in @H. Partners confuse easy, don't make it hard for her)|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||sk||at|
nome: switch the @hK with @hA and that woud not happen :(:(
bseagram:  Yes, but it is the only way to beat the contract
so you have to put the ace in west's hand
And declarer has to pray that the  @c finesse wins|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||up|4|at|
bseagram:  In a finesse, always lead from weaker side of the suit towards the stronger
and lead the honour if your side owns the three next door neighbours
Do not lead a Q in a finesse if you do not own the J and the 10
Do not lead a J if your side does not own the Q and the 10 or the 10 and the 9|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||up|8|at|
bseagram:  Does anyone now have any questions (to table) players or kibitzers?
bernean:  if the clubs had been spades, still open 1NT?
bseagram:  Yes, still open 1NT. GOOD question.  If you have this hand:
@sKxx     @hAQxxx    @dAJ    @cQxx
and open 1@H and p now responds 1@S, what will your rebid be?|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|
4-3-3-3 or 4-4-3-2 or 5-3-3-2 are all balanced hands for an NT opener
MargoD:  Do you call that a balanced hand with such poor @D?
bseagram:  You must not be nervous about diamonds. I promise you that if you open 1NT and have a useless doubleton, 
then p will always have an Ace or K in that suit 
OR opponents will forget to lead that suit|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|
Lizabc: I thought u promised all suits stopped
bseagram:  Lizabc, that was so back in 1939 and you are not old enough (checked your age on Google)
moonjohn: Are u saying that if you have this shape and a 5 card major: open 1NT, and not the major?
bseagram:  Yes, for sure, that is my strong belief|

pc|C3|pc|C5|pc|CT|at|bseagram: The lead is 4th best from longest and strongest
This is the key moment
Leland, you now know that partner was supposed to play his highest card
third hand high and she only managed to produce the 10
ALWAYS assume p knows what she is doing|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  If she had A or K or Q, she would have played one of those
Thus, we know (by deduction) that she does not have any of these cards... East must have them.
Therefore NO point continuing with that very tired feeble, incapable suit
Makes sense?

up|52|at|
bseagram:  NS gets 5 tricks this way instead of only 1 (if you had continued the clubs at trick 3)
realrowdy:  we liked your tired weak and feeble lead better!
bseagram:  Leland started with an interesting lead of @s3. Not a bad lead
BUT if I felt compelled to lead that suit, I would not lead the 3
P will be leading that suit back from now till hell freezes over thinking I had an honour.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  Should have a J or better to lead fourth best
If I were going to lead it, I would want to make a top of nothing lead. But not wanting to waste a 10 which is a quasi honour in NT, I would have led the @s8 which will look like a top of nothing lead so p won't get aroused by the lead|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  When leland sees that firsty can only produce the @c10, leland shoud be very depressed.
That means that firsty has no lovely honour in Clubs. When leland gets on lead (when he cleverly wins the Ace Dimaonds), he can now COUNT DECLARER'S TRICKS 
5 Diamond tricks, Ace Spades, AKQ Clubs
When you as an opponent can count 9 tricks for declarer it is always time to shift to another suit|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  In hopes that your side can score 5 tricks before declarer can score 9
jacquiek:  Was it correct to lead the @hAce?
bseagram:  YES, when you have AQx Hearts, it is important to unblock the suit
Have a look at what happens if leland leads @h3 
P wins K and leads it back and NS only get 3 heart tricks. N's @h will be high but he will never be able to take it|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|
sblitz:  Was N's discard of @d4 a suit preference signal (i.e., lead @h, not @s)?
bseagram:  Discard?    Do you mean when he FOLLOWED to first round of @D?
No, he is only following suit|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  Top of nothing by the way (someone had a question) is NOT a great lead in NT
If it goes 1NT on your right  and 3NT on your left..(in a DIFFERENT hand)|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhat do you lead with this hand?^^c9^sAQ82hKJ93dKJ7c95^| 
lb|*mHowmany points will your partner have?^don't know~0-1~2-4~5-6^2^|at| 
bseagram:  Here's the thought...How many points does your partner have??????
You must always always always always ...(did I say that too often?) count up p's points before making an opening lead
1NT - 3NT means they have approx 26HCP
you had 14 HCP on that example hand    @sAQxx @hKJxx  @dKJx  @c95  That leaves p with NO points
She is a pointless partner|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||at|
Whatever you now lead will be helping declarer if you lead a @S, @H or @D
Thus, extra master points to those who chose the @c9! That is a good time to be leading a top of nothing
And YES, even though it is a doubleton. You do not want to GIVE a trick away by leading one of your good suits
We lead fourth best when we know p has some "STUFF"...but here we new she had NO stuff!!|

bseagram:  OK, South won trick one with the @sK in dummy
Reason is he has @sA10 in hand
Thus if W gets on lead, she will have a horrible time leading a @S into declarer's A10|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|
West however knows that declarer has the @s10. 
ÌF E had the 10, E would have signalled with a higher spade.  (say East holds 10 6 2 spades) he MUST play the 6 to show an equal honor. Did everyone know that about equal honor signal?
Kibbies: nnnnnynnn
bseagram:  It is imperative that you tell p that you have an honour equal to one you know she has|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  it is like showing your attitude
If p leads the K and you have J72, you play the 7, telling him you are wild about his lead
billyjef:  not drop the spade 10 on Q?
bseagram:  drop  the 10 if you have a doubleton
East plays the 2 here = no 10  and South kept the TENACE of A10 in his hand
(AQ is a tenace, so is KJ, so Q10 etc: Broken honour cards)|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |

pc|d2|lb|*mWhat should EAST play next?^@dAce~@d5^1^|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|at|
bseagram:  when @D is led from dummy at trick 2, E MUST hop up with Ace diamonds
contrary to second hand low theory! E knows that W has a good suit and needs to KEEP HIS ENTRY to that suit
so E must hop up with that Ace (KEY play) and lead back a @S|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||sk||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|at|
bseagram:  South wins it and leads a high D to force out the missing @dK
W wins it and her suit is now developed AND she had the entry. Good news all round, but not for lukie
That was a bit of a tough hand
South COULD duck the @s for sure at that time and pray that E has the @dK also
but it is UNLIKELY that E has @dK unfortunately, as he won the first diamond with the Ace.|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  When you are trying to win a trick, win from the bottom
Win from the BOTTOM but lead from the TOP   VERY important concept
You have K1052 and lead 2       :  p has QJ3, he must play J
That says I MIGHT have the Q...if instead he plays Q, it says I do NOT have the J|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  So when you are trying to win a trick, you win as cheaply as possible when you have touching cards
It is the opposite of leading.     When you have QJ10 and are leading the suit, you lead Q
lead from the top|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||at|
ljmacleod:  would W lead another @S if South ducked?
bseagram:  For sure W would lead another @S as he has an entry and wishes to set up his Spades|

bseagram: SJP, why did you continue with the K Diamonds? 
Did you think that MICK's @d7 was a high card?   I know it sure looked high
here's the story|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  If you lead an ace (which by the way is the best lead against a suit contract when you also have the King)
you have to now look at partner's face to see what her attitude is about your lead
well, maybe not her face as that is cheating, you have to look instead at the size of the card she plays
If she plays a 2, she does not like the suit and cannot help you if you continue|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  if she plays the 9, she LIKES and you must continue (she has either the Q92 or 92 so you continue from the top
But when she plays any card in between, you have to look to see if you can see the CARDS BELOW partner's card
That will determine whether the card is a high one (encouraging) or a low one (discouraging) I am teaching only standard signalling|

bseagram:  S played the 7...looks high at first
BUT in dummy you saw the 632, if declarer played the 5 (oops she didn't...nice play W and you DID make it tough for N)
IF declarer plays the 5...you have (N) in your hand the 4
Therefore the 7 would be a low card|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram:  declarer falsecarded and made it very tough for you. I think in this case you did fine and I may well have done the same thing myself
BUT IF declarer played the 5, you must remember to read that 7 of partner's as a low card and now shift to the only possible other suit for partner to have an ace in...Clubs
then S wins the Ace Clubs and leads back a @D to you|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||sk||at|
bseagram:  Declarer should always play their second lowest card IF they wish suit continued by defenders
Always trust your partner
bseagram: SJP, you did just fine in light of what Donna did (playing the 10 and not the 5)|

bseagram:  N must bid 2 @S unless playing support doubles
Raising to 2@S does NOT guarantee 4 card support, you prefer to have 4 but can raise with 3 if unable to bid NT
The support double is a great bid|

up|15|at|bseagram:  Let's look at the hand. It is a most interesting phenomenon that many have never heard of.
When p leads an ace (most of the time 99%) promising to also have the K)
The partner of ace leader has a responsibility when she holds QJ in that suit
(remember that you KNOW your side cannot take 4 tricks in that suit, in this case only 2 tricks in @d because dummy only has 2)|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at| 
bseagram:  therefore E must play Q under p's Ace (it only hurts for a little while)
That is a special signal that says: "Partner, I also have the J of this suit, in case you wish to get me on lead (OR I have the singleton Q)"...IN CASE p wishes you on lead
It does not say "I wish to be on lead"  just in case you wish me on lead|

bseagram:  and West DOES wish East on lead BADLY
W wants E on lead to lead a @C
so at trick 2, W must lead a small @D to p's J (after the Q is played at trick one) and then E will lead back a @C to W because when dummy is on your right, you lead to the weakest suit in sight!
Does that make sense?|

dee_dee_20: yes  but I read  a doubleton instead  7 4
and led low 2 to tell her were to find me
bseagram:  ljmacleod, by playing hi low in @D you told p that you could overruff the dummy as you also have a doubleton @D
YES
The low one will beg for a @C but it should be automtaic anyway
Moral of story when you as a defender have Qx  doubleton, never play Q first thinking that you are showing a doubleton. 
Because íf you do, you are promissing to have the J or a singleton Q.
