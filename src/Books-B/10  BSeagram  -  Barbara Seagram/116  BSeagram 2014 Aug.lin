^bThe Special Event Team (SET) organised on the 4th of August 2014 
^ba bid, play and discuss session: ^*b"ENDPLAYS"^*n 

^bwith:             ^*bBarbara Seagram^*n 

EventHst4:  @D@D It gives me great pleasure to welcome Barbara Seagram (bseagram) back to the BILies Retreat.  Barbara leads a hectic life as an author, bridge teacher and club owner.   
She travels frequently - having visited 130 countries. 
Barbara started teaching bridge in 1976. In 1990, Barbara and her husband, Alex Kornel, bought the Kate Buckman Bridge Studio (named by the ACBL as the top Bridge Club in North America).
Barbara & Alex started the Barbara Seagram School of Bridge in 2006. It has been an enormous success. 
They teach thousands of students a year. They also run a small bridge club in Toronto.

Barbara is a Gold Life Master.  She was recently named number 40 on the list of the top 52 bridge personalities that have most influenced the game, EVER!    
She is the recipient of many awards, most notably The Kate Buckman Award 
(person who has contributed most to others enjoyment of the game) and the Audrey Grant Award for teaching. 
Barbara has 21 published books plus her text books but says that the best thing she has ever done is 
^*b"the cheat sheets"^*n.   They are a comprehensive, very detailed summary of all the main facts. 
Her books:  ^*b"Planning the Play of a Bridge Hand"^*n  and  ^*b"25 Bridge Conventions You Should Know"^*n 
have both won the Book of the Year awards.  
So without further ado, let give a warm welcome to Barbara Seagram!!  :)  Take it away! " @d@d

Barbara: "On Tuesday, an article about End Plays will be posted on my website under articles.
There will also be information there about how to join BIL (Beginners Intermediate Lounge). 
It is an excellent thing to do."



^bYou may contact Barbara for additional information at:      bseagram@uuniserve.com

^bEnjoy this presentation of Barbara's "ENDPLAYS" session in the BIL!


bseagram:  Thank you SO much, Babs. Babs does an amazing job for BIL. I could not do any of this without her. 
She is a star! Thank you, Babs.
And thank you to Maureen for creating BIL, a great site on BBO.  And to Karen who does so much also. 

An important note to everyone. There are a lot of hands with Jacoby 2NT in them. 
Thus, I am going to do the bidding for you on these hands so that we do not have undo's. 
I will then discuss the bidding.

at|bseagram:  South is in 6@S and let us look at bidding.
I now will talk about the Jacoby 2NT-convention
Without this convention, it would be nigh on impossible to describe this hand.
Have a look at north hand.  Does everyone see how tough it would be to bid after partner opens 1@S? 
...how else could you possibly bid this?
2NT by responder to 1 of a Major says: I have 13 or more points and at least 4 of partners Major suit trumps.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: These hands are NOT about how to get to game...it is simple to get to game
BUT sometimes we can get to slam with only 26 points by finding magic on a hand
Magic is when partner has a singleton in the right place
So this is an important convention.
Opener now has things to show...it is no good to just know page one of the convention|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


sk|s|at|
Opener now shows a singleton or void at the 3-level if he has one|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  If not, he just bids 4 of Major if he has a minimum and no singleton or void
OR    3 of Major   if he has 16 or more points and no s'ton or void
There is one more rebid for opener that I will not bother with right now.|

You may have played the hand differently from the way it is played here.
This will not mean you had the wrong plan.
At the end of each hand you will have the oppportunity to test your own plan Double Dummy
And Barbara will guide us through the correct play after each hand is played out.

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


up|43|pf|y|at|bseagram:  This is a tough hand, marika and you have not learned this yet.
I am going to teach by words and then we can replay
This is a contract that depends on a finesse...agree ??
A finesse only works 50% of the time
Would you buy a used car from someone who told you that your brakes would work only 50% of the time???
So let's find another way. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  South counts losers.   One diamond and one potential heart loser
That's too many
The hand is fairly evenly divided which makes for a great possibility for the "Strip and Throw in"
There are 4 suits,   trump suit...draw as many as possible
Strip suits, the Clubs in this case.   Easy suit, no problems with this suit but strip completely
With the strip suit, if you have an extra club in hand you must trump in dummy
or an extra club in dummy, have to ruff in hand|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: Just like when you get into shower, you have to strip completely!!!
So, next is the DO NOT TOUCH suit...in this case Hearts.   Vow to not touch this suit 
Then next is the EXIT suit, in this case Diamonds...this is the suit with which you will THROW THEM IN
So when you are in a contract that depends on a finesse, think of the strip and throw in and whether you can do it.
WIN @dAce at trick 1 ...draw 2 rounds of trump and then play all clubs and then STOP
(MM: You can follow Barbara's notes by clicking on the cards or try at the end of the notes)|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: Now play @D and one of opponents will win  (the @d is your EXIT suit). 
At this point your LHO will give you a sluff and a ruff (or lead a @h for you). 
When given that opportunity (which is a declarer's dream come true, ALWAYS ruff in dummy and sluff from your hand  
On this hand, it does not matter where you ruffed and where you sluffed but often it will.
What if west had now led a @H instead after trick 7???? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: Then you play low from dummy and you South will win with the @h10 
You have thrown them in and given them ugly choices to make. 
Whatever they do now will help you.
If you had to play Hearts yourself, you would have to rely on a guess as to who had the @hQ
This is called an end play because it happens near the end of the hand
(MM: Trick 1 was the important trick here, at trick 1 you prepared the final "endplay", making the term "endplay" confusing 
as here it all started at trick 1)|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: Better term is STRIP AND THROW IN
There is however an easier way when playing in real life
You start doing your stretching exercises at a time like this
You lean left and right till you can see who has the Heart Queen
annmorton: mama says, one peek worth 2 finesses|

pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|hK|at|bseagram:  Now everyone, have a look at the Diamond suit on this hand
On this hand, you will see that you have THREE Diamond losers
You must call this 3 losers unless you are playing against friends or relatives.
PLUS one heart loser
Reason it is 3 @D losers is that if South has to play the Diamond suit herself, 
then she would lead the @d3 from South and WEST MUST play second hand low|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: If west jumps up with Ace Diamonds, he has captured only air
Aces were put on this earth to capture Kings and Queens. Kings were put on this earth to capture Q's and J's|

Kib: Dodgy suits are to be left alone
bseagram: Yes, dodgy suits (are you British??) are to be left alone. I like that expression. 
For North Americans, we call them "Do not touch" suits
(MM: or "frozen suits".....or is that Dutch?? :) )|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram: So @D here are the "do not touch" suit on this hand
Marika, play the hand.  Win @hAce first as W leads @hK.  Draw 2 rounds of trump. 
Then strip clubs and exit with Heart|

You also have to have a suit with which to EXIT or throw opponents in with...|

Thus you have to WIN the first trick!
Otherwise you eventually will have to break the spades yourself.

nt||
up|39|pf|y|at|bseagram:  I received a good question: "How do we recognize the potential for an end play?"
When your contract depends on a finesse and the hands are relatively even-steven...
i.e. not a 5-card side suit (non-trump suit) in dummy,
then is when you think:  "Can I do a strip and throw in?"|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  East west started spades for you which allows you to only lose 2 spades 
(you got lucky and they were kind but this will not happen ever again)
Whenever you START a new suit as opponents, it usually gives declarer an extra trick. 
That is why we LOVE leading tops of sequences as opponents, as we NEVER give away a trick that way.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||at|Holden47:  If I don't take the first trick then I can't do this
bseagram:  CORRECT, you MUST take first trick so you can throw them in.
Holden47:  With the Ace showing in dummy would they lead them again though?
bseagram:  If you do not take the first trick with Ace, holden, then they should lead back a @D, to avoid helping you.|

pc|CK|at|bseagram:  @cK, top of a sequence is the best lead in bridge.
cindyb0707:  Knowing about the singleton?
bseagram:  Top of sequence never gives anything away and is always the safest lead
It will never cost and will always be a safe lead
Against slams, always lead safest lead.
dj13:  thanks Barbara, just hard to do sometimes
bseagram:  If you have trouble, I always say take some valium or have a mickey in your pocket
|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||sk|e|at|bseagram:  Everyone will have a different opinion about all this bidding but the point is about 
getting there somehow (to 6) and then playing it. 
Redbird44:  Why is west the 4NT bidder here? Seems to me that W should bid 4@S and E bid 4NT? 
bseagram:  It could have gone that way, I agree. 
I wanted to prove a point about liking a singleton or not liking a singleton.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: e.g. If partner shows you a singleton and you have KJ5, you are turned OFF and will not pursue 
thoughts of slam.  (W that is).   These are called wasted values.
Reason is that when you lead towards KJx and you play J, the last player wins with Q.... 
and now you have to trump your K as well. 
We are trying to get to 6 on some of these hands (playing Jacoby 2NT) even if we only have 26 points.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: On this particular hand, if W had bid only 4@S, then E indeed would have gone on as he had a big hand.
wik54: What is opener's first rebid over J2NT?  s/v at 3-level or second 4 carder at 4-level? (if opener holds both)  
bseagram:  There is one more option as opener on their rebid:
If you have a second 5-card suit headed by 2 of top 3 honors, you bid that suit at the 4-level. 
Responder now decides if their side now has a fit in that second suit. 
Another reason to be turned on or off with a hand.|

This is a tough hand.

nt||at|rrr1234: What is the reason for ruffing a club before drawing trump, please?
bseagram: Indeed it would have been fine to ruff the @C later on.   No problem at all. 
As long as you leave enough entries for doing so and having pulled trump and "stripped"  Hearts, 
make sure you end in dummy so you can now lead the @cJ and pitch a  @d on this.

Let's look at that hand
Does everyone see what aladymo did so eloquently?
She had to have an exit suit so she threw S in with the @sQ 
having STRIPPED the hole hand of all the other suits
Then when S was in, goldendog had to give declarer a sluff and a ruff,   or lead back a @S|

What we need to know is the RULE OF 40.
There are 40 HCP in the deck. EW have 34 HCP  =>   Bad guys (opps) only have 6 HCP
That cannot add up to two aces.|
pg| ***** 201 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: 4NT by E (quantitative) can be passed by West!
We ONLY use blackwood when a trump suit has been agreed upon and it has not here.
E could have had 4 spades and tried to find a 4-4 fit in spades, and heard @H from West....
4NT has to be quantitative now
4@C would have been Gerber asking aces, some even play that as Key card Gerber|
