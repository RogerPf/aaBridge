ahollan1: Can't blame him -- slam just depends on finding trump Q or underlead @DQ. Maybe some squeeze possibilities.
algraves: @2Well good practical shot by Hamman, he knows he is stuck. Cowardly not to bid it really and he is anything if not fearless. @0
 ahollan1: If misguess @HQ, does @S return kill a double squeeze?|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|at| And percentage is low to King for singleton Q.

sv|b|mb|1H|fp|3|at| @2iceking: 35 imps 13 boards to go.
athene: @2EW might well be in slam in the other room on these cards.
|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|at|2NT is natural and game-forcing, right? @0
 passell: Another slam on a queen guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt||fp|3|at| @2iceking: 6@H probably in both rooms and both will guess it as its correct line to guess @H here.
phil: Lots of squeeze chances too.|pg||
mb|3H!|
at|
vugraphztb: Moss did not alert, I believe, the 3@H bid, but Gitelman did alert it to Rodwell.|pg||
at|
passell: Percentage to get it correct  all equal except sing Queen.
iceking: Reason S might have stiff Q.
vugraphztb: Meckstroth needs his system card.
iceking: So this should be a push in 6@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt||fp|3|at| @2phil: If he makes 6 he'll make 7, won't he?
vugraphztb: Please have someone bring Meckstroth's system card.|pg||
mb|3S|
at|
athene: Double squeeze around spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|
at|
phil: Right.
passell: Yes.
iceking: @2Right, there is also double squeeze. @S lead though breaks it and continue @S if he gets @H correct or if he gets heart incorrect i meant.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|
mb|p|mb|5S|
nt||fp|3|at| athene: @25@S looks odd - doesn't east know by this point that the @HQ is missing? So 5@S (if it's a grand slam try) is a bit weird. |pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|
mb|p|at|
Wow, this will be fun! @0
 @2phil: WOW!
iceking: Oh boy!|
mb|p|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| @2vugraphztb: Rodwell asking questions of Gitelman.
athene: Now the double squeeze is for the contract, not the overtricks.
iceking: Did 5@S ask for extras and 5nt showed extra trump?
passell: Probably lead a trump now.
phil: Not the call I would expected 35 up.
athene: @2And once more we see just how bad it is to lead a trump against a grand slam. But of course if North doesn't lead a trump, Moss might decide there is only one reason for that... and play a heart to the jack.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| @2vugraphztb: Rodwell's convention card, I believe, was passed to Moss, but Meckstroth still needs his system card.
phil: Been told 6@h next door so a lot riding on this one.
passell: Can't imagine leading anything else unless you think opponents have screwed up.
iceking: This could be brutal board for Nickell.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| athene: @2As a kibitzer suggests, it's just barely possible that they are bidding this to flatten the board thinking that EW in the other room will bid it. @0
 @2iceking: Depends what info Rodwell got from Gitelman. They are screenmates, right?
vugraphztb: Rodwell and Gitelman are screenmates.|pg||
pc|h3|nt||fp|3|at| @2iceking: Oh boy!
jkotor: Now even I would make it :).
passell: Yes, once he later plays AK and a dia ruff he can't fall out of it.
iceking: I wonder what he told him 5@S was. If it asked for extra trump you might lead something else.
dburn: I imagine that Gitelman's 5@s was an effort to get Moss to bid seven with a seventh heart.
iceking: If that's the case, is it still automatic to lead trumps?
phil: Would love to know Fred's explanation of 5NT.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| athene: @2In case anyone is wondering about the double squeeze mechanism - the idea is, you can just cash the minor-suit ace-kings and @SK and run the trumps; now on the last trump North has to keep a diamond and South has to keep a club so no-one can keep a third spade.
The ending is @Hx / @S8 / @C5 in West hand and @SAx / @Dx in East hand. @0
|pg||
at|
 @2phil: Isn't this a classic compound once North has the diamond length - you can make even if North has the club length?
jkotor: What about simple squeeze in minors?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|
nt||fp|3|at| @2vugraphztb: Meckwell give no note that disaster has struck.
dburn: But that jack of hearts was a bit odd. Suppose South had the singleton queen?
iceking: Yes, should go up with Dummy's K.
passell: Yes, pay off to trump lead from the queen agaist 7.
athene: Only the Rueful Rabbit leads from @HQxx (he has the @HQ in with his diamonds).|pg||

pc|d2|nt||fp|3|at| @2athene: Diamond ruff just to try to isolate the menace with North.
vugraphztb: Meckstroth stops to think.
Walddk4: This is just a "simple" double-squeeze now.
athene: Yes, now he knows it will be a compound squeeze.
passell: This was perfect for him catching North with long diamonds. Doesn't have to guess the squeeze.
athene: Even if North had a club guard he is getting squeezed out of it very soon.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|d7|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| athene: @2Zia solved the @HQ guess dilemma in a neat way in six in the other room. He just refused to play trumps. Ended up with a 3-card ending. Exited with a club and the defence had to find the @HQ. That is reminiscent of a famous Belladonna hand in "Bridge with the blue team" where he finds the queen of trumps exactly the same way.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| @2passell: After this board meckwell will know they are in big trouble. The gloves will come off.
iceking: I am still little shocked about this 5@S bid from Gitelman.|

iceking: So 48 imps 12 boards to go.
athene: If Meckwell take that board without a flicker they are tough competitors indeed.

vugraphztb: Rodwell says that 3@H was not explained and Rodwell apologizes and then says I am sorry.|pg||
