ht|f|n|#|3|at|^*bMaureen Hall^*n |FP||AT|('hallway' on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :|
Lg|e|n#|3|at|
^d@.  For beginner bridge players to escape to
^d@.  Where we could have teachers come and give lessons without interference from Advanced players
^d@.  Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice
^d@.  For the beginner to go to and have one on one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions

In 2001/2/3  there was nowhere for that to happen and so in September 2003 Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL  ^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N  began.

In 2005  having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project - the BIL Library was opened in Aug 2007.  An important feature of the Library is the selection of 'Bridge Movies'  (also known as .lin files).

Towards the end of 2020 with a potential new web site for the BIL, Maureen asked me to compile this archive of 'Bridge Movies' from the BIL Library and to include it here inside aaBridge.

First it must be stressed that the core of the BIL Movies are not here in ^*b THIS ^*n section!  Instead they are spread out across all the ^*b Books ^*n in the aaBridge menubar.  The preeminent star of all 'bridge movie' production is Kinoosh Radsan (BBO Id 'Nome') known to us all as 'Kia', see the ^*g::Hondo717 and Nome, Hondo717 and Nome ^*n section for the details.  
|n^|5|at|
It is not an exaggeration to say that well over half of all the lin files here, inside aaBridge (and probally in the world) have been written by Kia.  In truth, I wrote aaBridge in order to better play the movies that Kia's had already started writing for the BIL.

I hope this archive can also give a flavor of the early days of the BIL.  The earliest lin file, still existing, written for the BIL is possibly, ^*g:::Bridge Myths, Bridge Myths ^*n by Jake (Michael Roche) from 2004.
