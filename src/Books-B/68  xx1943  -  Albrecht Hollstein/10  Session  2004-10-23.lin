You cannot win, if West has Dia K AND club A. If SOUTH has Dia K all is well, but if North has this K and South the club A, you must take the diamond finesse first. |pg||

nt|South to play 3NT. West leads the 10 of spades. Now South can take the first spade, because he can finesse the hearts in a way, that only West (the not dangerous opponent can gain the lead. But be careful: Dont play the A of hearts prematurly. EAST may have Qxxx of hearts.|

The beginners mistake is to take the J or Q from table. You must win this trick with spade A so that you have a sure entry to the dummy after hearts are high.|pg||

West leads heart Q. You must hold up once, in case hearts are 5/3. If the diamond finesse is wrong, you are a trick short. Therefore u must develop just one club-trick, before you take the diamond finesse. If you first play on diamonds, EAST will clear the hearts with his third and WEST has A of clubs as entry yet. Result: down 1|

nt|EAST to play 2NT. South leads a heart. The catch in this hand is, that there is no catch. You must hope, that the diamonds behave friendly, being 2/1 or 3 with South.|pg||
