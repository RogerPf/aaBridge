pc|S4|pc|S2|nt|Mistake. South must foresee the endplay and to prevent rise with his A. This cannot cost something. If declarer has the K of spades, this is doubleton (partner must have 6 for the bidding and very very likely the K.|pg||

nt| North showed up with 9 black cards and so has only 4 red.
The heart finesse must be on anyway. There are now two possible lines:
1) Squeeze in the reds against South.
2) North having K of hearts singleton or doubleton. 
3) North having K 10 of hearts.
There is no way to combine these lines.|pg||
nt|It must be rite to play the last 2 clubs, throwing 2 diamonds and a heart from dummy and watch South's discards.|pg||

nt|Now declarer has to decide, what is the ending. He misses heart K 10 5 4 3. Who of the opponents has what? It seems South is doing some falsecarding, except he started with 6 diamonds and heart 10 8 7. This is now a question of table-presence to figure out what is going on.|pg||
nt|I was a bit of sad, that Dwayne didn't got the chance to demonstrate his skill, because South gave him his 11. trick earlier on.|pg||

pc|H6|pc|H5|nt|Next decision to make: Started South with 10873 or 8753 in hearts. To guess rite, you must know South, what he(she) is up to.
IMO he (she) would not falsecard in the way he(she) did with 8753 and therefore .........|pg||
