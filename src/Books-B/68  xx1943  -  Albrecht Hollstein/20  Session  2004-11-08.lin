After drawing trumps, he loses the club finesse to WEST. But the contract is sure with 1S+5H+1S-ruff+3C. Opponents take only 1S+1C+1D.  What if East overtakes the lead with his K?|pg||

nt|South must play this 3NT very careful. If the diamond finesse loses, East may play through his remaining spade honour. Therefore he must hold up the spades twice.|pg||
