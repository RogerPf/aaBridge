at|This hand I played in a BBO-teammatch and after opponents had won 4@s my partner was very angry with me. Try to found out, what my fault was.
I'll report my thoughts in the bubble near WEST.
If you want to see not only my hand and dummy's just click my name or click a players name twice.|
pg||sb|wNow what to lead? Diamond is out. Spade seems the safest choice. Partners holds 2 trumps at most.|

pg||pc|S4|pc|SA|pc|S3|pc|S5|sb|WIt seems partner likes my lead. Dummy has a lot of ruffing values indeed.|

pg||pc|HQ|pc|H6|pc|C9|pc|H9|sb|WLet us start to count eclarer's HCP:
9 in spades and 6 in hearts summs up to 15.|

pg||pc|CQ|pc|C4|pc|C7|pc|C6|sb|wThis was a finesse. Partner probably holds the 2 minor Ks|
pg||sb|w|pg||sb|wGood news: Declarer is nailed on the table. I'll get in and remove the last trump.|

pg||pc|CJ|pc|CT|pc|DQ|pc|C8|sb|wVery bad luck. Though our great defense declarer made his bid.|nt|"Nope" may partner said, "you gave the contract to declarer!"|

Do you see my mistake?|sb|wOuch|

Ok let's go back a few tricks|up|20|sb|w|
pg||at|
In this situation I played too fast. I was so eager to remove dummy's last trump, that I didn't realized the coming endplay. I had to cash @dA first and then play trump.|
pg||sb|wBut what if declarer ruffs the  diamond A and can ruff a club?|
pg||nt|Take a moment to count declarers hand: declarer started with 4-4 in majors and play of the @c suit showed that he holds AJx(x) in the suit. Partner had covered the @cQ for sure holding KJ or A. So declarer's most probable holding is 4423 (Remember he opened 2NT so he should not hold a small singleton @d)|sb|w|
pg||nt|If you count declarers HCP: 9(@s+6(@h)=15 so he needs 5 more for his bid. That must be @AJ. 

So it is safe to cash @dA before you remove the last trump from dummy.
Silly me, I should have known better respectivly I should not play so fast.|sk||sc|y|

pg||pc|ddsc|nt|This time declarer is endplayed and must lose the last trick.|mc|9|
pg||nt|There is a nother remarkable point: My partner defended very well in not covering the @cQ with his K. Let us go back and see what had happened if he had done so:|
pg||up|20|nt|See what had happened, if he covers accordingly the old saying: "honor on honor...."|
