   Here is an example of a (simple?) 3NT contract where declarer had the choice 
   between 2 suits to look for the extra trick he needed.
   
   Declarer played without plan and got it wrong
   .

Only @s and @d the 2 suits with 6 cards in the combined hands remain to look for the needed extra trick.
Development by length is not possible, so you must finesse or promote.|

nt|To score a 2nd trick in @s, you need WEST to hold both @sK and Q. That is about 25%. In @d you hold Q1098 and must score a trick for sure, if A, K and J are knocked out. You promoted the 8 to take the 4th trick. If opponents attack the @s in between, they are very welcome. They cannot prevent you to make a 2nd trick in @s, if THEY play the suit.|

{A1052 -J3 makes an extra normally only if opponents play the suit}

{Q8 - 10964 makes always an extra trick, if you can afford to lose the lead 3 times.}|
