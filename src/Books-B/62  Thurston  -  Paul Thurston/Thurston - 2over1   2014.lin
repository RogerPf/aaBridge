ht|g|fp|3|cs|1|at|^k{From the Gazette}|
tu|y|

fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|ht|I|at|The Introduction in the BIL Bulletin was as follows:


You are having a nice comfortable session and you pick up: 
  @s AK1093 @h 754 @d AKJ4 @c 8 
and open 1@s.   Partner raises to 2@s 
Now that a fit has been found, you like your game prospects and advance boldly to 4@s. 

Unfortunately, partner tables less than an ideal dummy (for your bidding, hers was impeccable!) 
  @s Q76 @h K842 @d 103 @c Q942 
A few things go wrong and you are down 2!|pg||at|



While licking your wounds from that debacle, you go on to the next round 
where you pick up a startling collection (your memory is good!): 
  @s AK1093 @h 754 @d AKJ4 @c 8 
and  open 1@s over which partner bids 2@s 

Thinking maybe the session has turned into one with bad lies, you pass only to see: 
  @s Q76 @h KJ92 @d 103 @c A942   
come showering down and making game is easy!|

pg||nt||
tu||
fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|at|




Next round you pick up: 
  @s AK1093 @h 754 @d AKJ4 @c 8   and, of course, you open 1@s and see 2@s by Partner. 
Having had bad experiences (and recently, too!) with the direct blast and conservative pass, 
you decide to consult partner this time, you bid 3@s:  "game or no Partner?" 

But partner is right in the middle of his range: 
  @s Q76 @h KQJ2 @d 103 @c 9742 and decides conservatism is called for. 
(bidding close games at pairs is not always a paying proposition) 
Only to find the fit is excellent and game rolls home.|pg||at|
 



One last round before the final scores are posted and other than the three deals above, 
your session has been good but, wouldn't you just know it, for the last deal you pick up: 
  @s AK1093 @h 754 @d AKJ4 @c 8 
open 1@s,  get the inevitable raise to 2@s  and, this time, stick to your guns 
and make the simple invitational rebid of 3@s 

Unfortunately, 
Partner has a collection similar to one he saw you languish in a partial opposite and make game. 

  @s Q76 @h 9842 @d 103 @c KQJ2 
So this time he thinks he's learned from experience when he accepts the invite and bids 4@s 
And aside from the first three @h-tricks and the @cAce you lose, it's quite a good contract.|

Thurston:

To start, 2/1 usually has a greater and more accurate way to raise major suit openings.

In SA or sayc, 1M-2M can be 3 or 4 trumps, 6-10 HCP 
and that's too wide a range of support for accurate follow up.

In 2/1, we usually add Bergen raises and use |cp|9|at|1M-2M|cp|2|at| as very specific: |cp|9|at|8-10 HCP with exactly 3 trumps.|cp|2|pg||at|
The Bergen variety I prefer now is Reverse: 
3@c = a 4-card limit raise, 10-12 and 
3@d = 7+-10 with 4 trumps (a 4-card constructive raise)

You'll note an overlap at the "10 end":     That is to distinguish good 10's from poor.
A's and K's = good cards,     Q's and J's = poor
1@s - 3@c with: @sAxxx @hKxxx @dKx @cxxx     (10 HCP) but 
1@s - 3@d with: @sKxxx @hQxxx @dQJx @cQx   (though also 10 HCP)|pg||at| 
After the raise, Opener will have a much better idea of when he should head towards game and when he should stop in a part score.

The next change focuses on how to try for game after a raise. 
Opener will usually need a medium hand (- 15-17 +) to try for game after 1M-2M
and the adds in distributional points after the raise, 
for example AJxxxx is worth about 2 more points for the 6th trump after supported.|pg||at|

In sayc or std, the usual way to try for game was to rebid the Major:  1M-2M-3M, 
to ask Partner if she was min. or max.|
pg||nt||
tu||
fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|ht|f|at|
But that ignores the element of FIT which is just about always more important - not "How many points partner?" 
but |cp|9|at|"Where are your points?"|cp|2|at|

If you look at the examples in the Gazette article, Opener had @sAKxxx  @hxxx  @dAKJx  @cx
and after 1@s-2@s wanted to try for game.|pg||at|

With example 3, Responder had @sQxx @hKQJx @dxx @cxxx   and game was easy, 
but with example 4: @sQxx @hxxx @dxx @cKQJx,  (the same point count) and game would go down.

3 was a "good fit" and 4 was not.
In any case, what Opener needs to know is "DO THE HANDS FIT WELL?"|pg||at|

What we use to find out is a "Help Suit Game Try": Opener bids the suit she has losers in to ask for help 
and Responder goes to game with help and stays out with no help.


Remember after 1@s-2@s we have a trump fit and that's what we're going to play in so bidding a new suit 
is NOT looking for a different trump suit - don't be greedy - one fit is enough.|pg||at|

  So with ex 3: @sAKxxx  @hxxx  @dAKJx  @cx , Opener rebids 3@h - "Can you help with my heart losers?"|pg||at| 
Responder 3:  4@s = Yes I can help
Responder 4:  3@s = no help in hearts|pg||at|

For this HSGT to work, we have to have agreed on a major: 1M-2M
and have room to say "no help" by going back to 3 of the Major.|
pg||nt||
tu||
fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|ht|f|at|
Kibby 1: What if the help suit is higher than the trump suit?|pg||at|
Thurston: If the Help Suit is higher ranking  (it will only be so after 1@h-2@h-2@s )  
then 4@h with help and 3@h without help.|pg||at|

Kibby 2: What constitutes help?|pg||at|
Thurston:  Excellent question: What is help?|pg||at| 

Usually the asker has about 3 losers
and Responder needs to be able to reduce that to no more than 2
KQJ = very good help, Ax = good help too, x = excellent as well,   Jxx or Qxx = not good enough
Kx is about 50% likely to be good help as is Kxx.|pg||at|

So with "maybe help" like Kx, I accept if the rest of the hand looks good and don't with real trash.
Qxx Kx Axxx xxxx = good,      Qxx Kx Qxxx Jxxx = not so good|pg||at|

A good thing to remember is that on the HCP scale, A's and K's are undervalued while Q's and J's are overvalued
and honors together are always better than honors all over the place: KQxx is better than Kxx Qxx|pg||at|


The key is to picture weakness with the asker and see if you can do something about it.


There will likely be more questions once we see some deals - maybe we can start those now?|

The bidding was good,|pg||at|
Kibby:  What was the 3@d bid?|pg||at|
T: 3@d was sort of a trial bid but not really necessary.|pg||at|
Kibby:  trial?|pg||at|
T: a trial bid means trying for game.|pg||nt||at|
When you have a decent 13 point opener or any 14+ and Partner makes a limit raise showing 4+ trumps and 10-12, 
go straight to game.|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: Is a "help suit game try" -bid alertable?|pg||at|
T:  yes, HSGT is alertable
Earlier someone wanted to know about dummy points for Responder West here|pg||at|
I simply count 11 HCP and 4 trumps and plug in a Bergen Limit raise.|pg||at|
Opener can add extra points for length, shape etc. but only at his second turn.
Responder can get too tangled up making a lot of adjustments|pg||nt||at|
Here you see 1 HCP for the @hJ but then should subtract 1 as an unguarded honor and then add one for a doubleton 
and on and on - too much accounting|pg||nt||at| 
Kibby: With West's 4@s rebid after East's 3@d Trial bid...
would that influence you to lead something other than the standard @dK?|pg||at|
T: As for the lead, the @dK stands out almost regardless of the bidding|pg||at|

A 3@c bid received an "undo".|pg||at|
T: If we're using ^*BHSGT^*N|at|, then 3@c says:  "I have 2 or 3 club losers, can you help?
Not an accurate description of West's hand, you do not need help in clubs.|pg||at|
What would be better?|pg||nt||at|
Several suggestions from Kibbitzers: 2NT, 3@h|pg||at|
Kibby: 3 card suit with 2 immediate losers as HSGT|pg||at|
T:  NT rebids usually only with balanced hands|pg||at|
(note movie maker: 2NT can be used as a "generalised" HSGT, but because you are not interested in @c help, better bid "up the line" : 2@s)|pg||nt||at|
Even though the suit in which we ask help often has 3 losers, 2 is OK too|pg||at| 
=> 2@s here is best|pg||mb|p|sk|e|mb|4h|at|
now @sKJxx|hc|skj32|at| is pretty good help => 4@h = 100%|pg||lc|skj32|nt||at|
Kibby: Is not the mistake the 2@h response?|pg||at|
T: No 2@h = 8-10 HCP with exactly 3 trumps, a ^*B"constructive raise"^*N|pg||at|
Kibby: Isn't East too strong for a mere 2@h?  11 dummy points?|pg||at|
T: a 1M-2M is constructive, not possibly weak as in std,|pg||at|   and I dont think dummy points are useful at that stage of the bidding as well as adding unnecessary complications|pg||nt||at|
T: When fit is what's important if Responder adds dummy points for her first bid, 
the hand will often be overvalued|pg||at|  - called ^*B"duplication of values"^*N|pg||nt||mb|p|mb|p|sk|w|mb|p|pc|sT|at|
Kibby: Why chose @s rather than @d as HSGT?|pg||at|
T:  You are all familiar with ^*B"up the line"^*N|at| in bidding and it works for HSGT too as most efficient use of space.|pg||nt||at|
One thing Responder can do when answering a HSGT|pg||at|
- when there's room - 
is to say No I cant help a lot there.....|pg||at| 
but I have very good cards in this other suit|pg||nt||at|
So after 1@h-2@h-2@s   If responder had xx in spades but maybe KQxx in diamonds,|pg||at| 
you could show the diamonds on the way back to 3@h 
(by bidding 3@d and that would suit this opener's hand very nicely too)|pg||nt||at|
But if Opener made her try in diamonds, Responder wouldn't have room below 3@h to show good spades!|pg||at|
1@h-2@h-3@d ,|pg||at| 
spade help might be useless and if Responder shows (by bidding 3@s), we are in game willy-nilly|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: If responder does show help in a different suit is it showing strength or can it also show shortness (s or v)?|pg||at|

Kibby: with 2 5-card suits, you automatically have shortness|pg||at|
T: Yes you do have shortness somewhere with 2 suits|pg||at|
but the source of tricks concept is very useful|pg||at|
Here, Responder knows his Ax diamond|hc|da5|at| opposite @dKQxxx is like gold|pg||at|
and the spade A has to be good too|pg||lc|da5|at|
so he can make a try for slam (4@s) despite having only 12 HCP because they are the right 12!|pg||
nt||at|
duffer66: Well even if I misbid it there (3@s showing shortness)...  Wouldn't his Axxx still be good opposite shortness?
Good enough to cue anyway? Or not?|pg||at|
T: Opposite shortness the @sAce would be good, and responder might cuebid 4@d|pg||at|
But he might also quit at 4@h|pg||at|
Because of only 1 high card (the @dA) in Partner's 2 side suits (@c and @d)|pg||nt||at|
Look at it this way: 3@s would tell about one card,    4@d tells about 5|pg||at|
duffer66: I am so happy for this exposition
as I have wondered the value of taking up so much room to bid the 5-card suit|pg||at|  
Kibby: So Jacoby 2NT is ok with 12 hcp?|pg||at|

fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|ht|f|at| 
Welcome to Paul Thurston's second session held in the BIL on February 23, 2012

^*BThurston:^*N|fp|2|at| The main focus of today's deals will be the |cs|1|at|{1NT FORCING}|cp|2|at| response to 1M,
- a frequent and critical component of 2/1.|pg||at|

- 1NT is only forcing over 1M
 (it is non-forcing over 1 minor or if Responder is a passed hand)|pg||at|

- The 1NT is usually assigned a range of approx 5-11 HCP but some will use it when a bit stronger.|pg||at|

- One main use: When holding a 3-card support for partner's Major but |cp|9|at|not enough strength to raise directly.|cp|2|at|
 (as we use 1M-2M as a "constructive raise" usually with exactly 3-card trump support)|pg||at|
 So Responder with:  @sQxx @hAx @dxxxx @cxxxx   responds 1NT to 1@s, 
 intending to show spades at his next turn - and there'll be a next turn because 1NT is forcing!|pg||at|

- Also: Responder with a good 11-12 points and 3-card support will be |cp|9|at|too strong for an immediate 2M,|cp|2|at| 
 though not enough trump support for a Reversed Bergen limit raise (3@c) and therefore responds 1NT.|pg||at|
 => With @sAJx @hQx @dKJxx @cxxxx 
 Responder bids 1NT and then shows spades at his second turn.|pg||at| 

- With the weak hand, responder will bid a minimum number at his second turn, 
 but will JUMP with the stronger example to show what is referred to as a "3-card limit raise".|pg||at|

- 1M - 2M:  a constructive raise is limited to 3-card support and 8-10 HCP: 
=>  1@s-2@s with:   @sQxx @hAQJx @dxx @cxxxx|pg||nt||
bt||
fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|ht|d|at| 
The forcing 1NT is also used with a weak hand and a long suit (usually 6+ card) of the bidder's own, 
that he's hoping to bid at his second turn.|pg||at|
The 1NT response limits the bidder's strength and the second call shows the hand type
So with:  @sx @hQxxxxx @dKJx @cxxx,    responds 1NT to 1@s 
and if Opener rebids 2@c or 2@d,   rebid 2@h to show length but not a strong hand.|pg||at|

Keep in mind that auctions that start with 1M and a 2/1 response in a new suit force the partnership to game.
Hands that in std might bid a new suit at the 2 level with 10-11 HCP can't do so in 2/1!!|pg||at|
With:  @sxx @hQxx @dAJxx @cKJxx,   Std might respond 2@c over 1@s to show 10+ hcp, 
|cp|9|at|but 1NT in 2/1|cp|2|at|    and depending on what happens next, 
Responder can then show his 11|pg||at| 

Kibby: If 1@h - 2@h is 8-10 pts and a 3-card support, 
how would Responder bid after 1@h with 6-7 pts and 3-card?  Just 1NT?|pg||at|
Thurston: Yes, precisely 1NT with 6-7 and 3-card support.
The occasional problem is that Opener will sometimes have to find a rebid when he'd be just as happy passing 1NT|pg||at|
  @sAQxxx @hKx @dxxx @cAxx   and you've opened 1@s, Partner answered 1NT
To rebid spades would promise 6 or more and you need 18-19 to raise to 2NT 
=> Opener has to "invent" a rebid in a 3-card minor.|pg||at|

Kibby: Does the sequence 1@s-1NT-2@d-2@s  promise 3 or can it just be a preference for @s 
say with a hand like @sxx @hAxx @dxxx @cKxxxx ?|pg||at|
Thurston: Yes, that preference sequence can be either a 3-card support in a weak hand or simply a preference on a doubleton.
In either case, Opener knows responder doesn't have a lot   - high cards or support - 
and will need a lot to carry on.        Let's move to the hands!

So the contract was made, but should it have been?|pg||at|
anniebmisc: I should have taken the last trump off the board
T:  But did you need to have been given that chance?|pg||nt||at|
When you have a side suit that needs setting up, 
that should be done ^*Bbefore^*N|at| drawing trump, as you may need dummy's trumps to help set up the side suit|pg||at|
As we'll see, game is cold on any defense
Let's back up|pg||nt||
up|51|sk|ns|at|
To start: the opening lead: Who has the @cA?|pg||at| 
As a rule players (good ones at least!) don't underlead aces vs suit contracts => W is marked with the Ace
So if W has the club A,|pg||at|....    don't play the K, play low and if clubs are continued (likely) ruff the second round|pg||pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|h3|pg||nt||at|
And now before drawing any trumps at all , start work on setting up the side suit (@d) by playing low to the Q|
pc|d2|pg||pc|d3|at|
(Good defense play here, second hand low)|pg||pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||at|
When that holds play another @d back to the Jack and Ace|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||nt||
pc|dT|at|
As suggested it might be possible that West will be out of diamonds after 2 rounds and that East might return a third round
|pg||pc|h9|at|In that case N ruffs the third @d with the 9 and wins in 2 possible situations:|pg||at|
Either W can't beat the 9 or if she can it will be with her side's natural trump trick|pg||nt||at|
If W has 3 hearts headed by 1 or 2 honors,  the defense cant gain a trick by her trumping a diamond!
Only when W started with: @hXx + a doubelton diamond,   can 4@h be defeated legitimately.|pg||nt||at|
But remember the play principle: When you have a side suit to set up, start with it before playing too many trumps|pg||pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||

The late Edgar Kaplan used to say "When you've been dealt a 3-card honor sequence, it's so you won't have to think about what to lead".|pg||nt||at|East is looking at a @c, possibly a @d loser (if the finesse fails) and 2 heart losers.|
pc|H2|pc|H9|pc|HA|pg||nt||at|
Had North played his K, East should hold up his Ace once, and hope it would be enough to deplete North from @h's. This in case his @d finesse fails. North out of hearts then, would not have a way to get to partners heart winner. 
Here North blocked the suit (by playing the 9)|pg||nt||
pc|DT|pc|D3|pc|D2|pc|DK|at|East tries de @d finesse, which loses,|pg||
pc|HK|at|
but the @h suit is blocked now.
When the @hQ was led, North can tell his partner has a sequence.
So just as if you were trying to set up a suit as Declarer, a Defender has to get the high cards in the shorter hand out of the way:|pg||nt||at|  In other words, N needs to play the K on top of part's Q, to have a little heart to lead back once in with the @dK|pc|H5|pc|H4|pc|H6|pg||nt||

The defensive unblocking play comes up often - don't be afraid to get out of partner's way - 
High cards aren't sacred - only tools|pg||nt||at|
There is another clue from the bidding, that tells North to unblock|pg||at|
East doesn't have 4 hearts, or otherwise would have rebid them => partner has 5 and it must be something like QJ10xx
Kibby: Is the Q lead always going to promise QJTx or QJ9x and never QJxx? 
T:  not always QJ10 or QJ9 but usually|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: How does East know that the hearts are 5-2? Or there is a way to know?
T: E has no way of knowing hearts are 5-2 and not 4-3
BUT if they are 4-3 nothing can be done, the defenders will always have communication,
only when hearts are 5-2 can East do something to disrupt the communication (i.e. hold up once)|pg||nt||

Thurston:  ok, pretty good play but some improvements
First on the diamond lead, a defender (W this time) should play the lower of equals => the @d9 not the 10|pg||nt||at|
Now North can finesse either opponent for the @cQ,    but why W?|pg||at|
Kibby: West is the danger hand
Kibby: West will lead a diamond
T:  Yes, W is the dangerous hand so you don't want him to win the @cQ and play a diamond through
=> up the K and back with the J was excellent.|pg||nt||at|
But then there shouldn't be any more club plays as the suit can be used to enter the N hand.
After locating the club Q, Declarer should do the same thing in hearts - Ace then the Jack for another finesse
That will lose but N will be safe with 4 clubs, 3 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 spade|pg||nt||at|
As it went with clubs all gone when E won the @hQ  - What could she have done better?|pg||at|
Kibby: Lead a spade.
T: For sure, not play back a heart because that's the suit N is trying to set up and has no entry left to his hand.
Exactly - back with the @sK!   to set up an entry to W's hand for a diamond through|pg||nt||at|
(simultaniously preventing herself from being endplayed)
And if E is counting HCP she can tell her partner has the @sQ
Declarer is known to have the @cA,  @dKJ , @hK    and with the @sQ added , would have bid more strongly
So the contract can always be made but could have been set this time|pg||nt||at|

When there's a misfit and no extra strength - QUIT before the doubling starts!
When West doesn't fit hearts, that's the worst time to run to NT - unless having a whole lot more than a minimal opening.
Here, EW should hope to use E's hearts and W's high cards to produce some tricks|pg||nt||at|

Very well played|
sc||up|52|sk||pf|y|
at|
In the play, East did very well by never trying to draw trumps simply scrambling as many ruffing tricks as possible.
One small point: Opening leads are always tough - anyone who always makes the "killing" or best lead, I want as a partner (and so does my regular partner!!)
But there are some guidelines that may help:|pg||nt||at|
For starters: We don't like to underlead aces against suit contracts.
But additionally we should avoid leading unsupported aces (meaning one without the King as well) as all you'll catch with it is air.
So even though clubs and spades have been bid, South should pick one of those for an opening lead,
preferably the spade as it's less likely to give anything away.|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: If P has bid a suit and you have Ax in it, should you lead A?
T: Yes, lead Ace from Ax if partner has bid the suit.

N would know game was good and slam was very unlikely so could jump right to 4S - this is an example of fast arrival at work

^l{ DAY 3 }|cp||fp|2|at|^b@2


Welcome to Paul Thurston's third session held in the BIL on March the first, 2012
As a preparation for Day 3 the following was published in the "Gazette":

 
|fp||cp|9|at|^*B"PASSED-HAND"  2/1 BIDDING SYSTEM^*N|at|

Context:
 
Once Responder has passed initially, he will not have the required strength to force to game over partner's 
3rd or 4th seat opening of 1@h or 1@s   (which may be shaded). 
Therefore,  natural and forcing 2/1 responses are no longer needed.
 
Further, since some very strong hands that an ^*Bunpassed^*N|at| hand might have had for 1NT (forcing) can't exist 
=> it is no longer necessary to retain the 1-round forcing nature of that 1NT response. 
Rather, the ^*Bpassed-hand 1NT^*N response to 1M is said to be ^*Bsemi-forcing^*N   (announcement, rather than alert) 
and will deny support for Opener's Major.
 
However, we still want to be able to distinguish between good 3-card and 4-card raises of partner's Major 
within the limits of what we can hold as a passed-hand and this we will do by including:
 
    |cs|1|at|{^*BTWO-WAY REVERSE DRURY^*N}|at|    (ALERT!)   in our arsenal.

   ^*BSummary of "Passed Hand Response" to Partner's  1M  Opening (third or fourth seat):^*N|cp|9|at| 

  {|cs|1|at|pass  pass   1M   pass 
  ?? }|at|
 
2M = 3 or 4 cards, 6-9 points
 
3M = less than 6 points, 4 trumps, ^*Bpreemptive^*N|at|
 
4M = less than 10 points, 5+ trumps, some distributional help
 
2@d = DRURY (alert) with 9-11 points and 3 card support
 
2@c = DRURY (alert) with 9-11 points and 4 (5) card support
 
1NT = 5-11 points, semi-forcing (announce) denies support for Major
 
2NT = RARE! Good 10-11 points, balanced, maximum doubleton Major, Invitational
 
2@h (over 1@s) = 8-11 points, 5+ @h's, non-forcing
 
2@s (over 1@h)  = natural and weak, equivalent to a bad weak 2@s opening

3@c or 3@d = good 6+ card suit, ^*Bmaximum passed hand^*N|at|, invites game, little or no support for opener 
                (maximum = a doubleton), a hand you almost wanted to open|fp|1|at|

^*BContinuations After Drury:^*N|at|
 
- Opener can sign-off: Show a minimum or even sub-minimum opener by returning to 2 of the agreed suit.

- Opener can try for game via HSGT: The bid of a new suit to ask for help, 2NT to ask for good trumps. 
  BUT over 2@c, to ask for @d help, you must bid 3@d.

- Opener can go directly to game based on fit, especially over 2@c where the 9th trump is present.

- Opener can make a game-forcing slam try in 1 of 2 ways:
  1. A jump to 3 of M demands a ^*Bcue-bid^*N|at|.
  2. Other single jumps in new suits are ^*Bself-splinters^*N|at| showing shortness and inviting a return cuebid 
     with the appropriate hand.
 
Over Drury 2@c, Opener can have a good hand that still isn't sure about game or even where to ask for help. 
In that case, he bids 2@d (ALERT!) an artificial rebid that says: 
"I have a real opener, tell me where you're strong, etc". 
Responder can then show a concentration of values in a new suit, a delayed splinter-bid or a bad Drury raise with scattered values by returning to 2 of the agreed suit.|pg||at|

^*BContinuations After Passed Hand 1NT:^*N|at|
 
Opener will not bid again with a balanced minimum (@sAQxxx @hKxx @dKxx @cxx)
If opener chooses to bid again, his rebids are the same as if the NT response was by an unpassed hand 
but auctions like: P - 1@s   1NT - 2@c  will generally deliver a real (4+) @c suit if the hand is minimum.
 
WARNING: The passed-hand 1NT bidder ^*Bwill not^*N|at| have genuine support for the Opener's Major 
so auctions like:  P - 1@s   1NT - 2@c   2@s: will show only a forced preference with 2 card support of @s's
Example:   @sxx @hKxxx @dQxxx @cQxx

^*BWhat Changes Over Interference:^*N|at|
 
1.  Responder is an ^*Bunpassed^*N|at| hand and ^*BOpponent doubles^*N the opening bid: 

|cs|1|at| { 1M    X     ?? }|at|

The simplest way to play is to ignore the double for all your raises.  
But: ^*BXX^*N can be used to show all strong hands without a fit that can be immediately expressed. 
New suit bids at the 2-level are natural and non-forcing 
=> to make a Game Force in a new suit, you must XX and then bid your suit at your next turn (if available)
(similar to standard methods)|pg||at|
 
2.  Responder is a ^*Bpassed-hand^*N and Opponent ^*Bdoubles^*N the opening bid:
All the Drury and other raises still apply, 1NT is still semi-forcing however it won't be as strong as 10+ 
since that hand should redouble|pg||at|
 
3.  Responder is ^*Bpassed or unpassed^*N hand and opponent makes a simple overcall:
 
|cs|1|at| { 1M   2?     ?? }|at| 

- 2M = 6-9 points, 3-4 trumps
- 3M = preemptive
- 3? = limit raise or better of partner's suit, usually with 4 trump
-  X = negative, may have 3-card limit raise hand-type
- 2 of a new suit= natural, 1 round force, 10+ points
- 2NT= 10-12, natural and invitational
- 3NT= 12-15, natural, generally no fit for M
- Jump in overcalled suit = splinter raise
- Single jump in new suit + jump shift = natural and game forcing 
  (prefer to make this bid only if you can keep the level below 3NT)
- Double jump in new suit = splinter raise of partner's suit|pg||nt||

^l{ DAY 3   DRURY}|cp|2|at|

Thurston: 
 
Some changes occur in the 2/1 approach when Partner opens 1 Major in third OR 4th seat
To start with, responder wont have enough to force to game 
so that leaves bids like 2@c or 2@d open for other uses.

There's also some concern with a 3rd seat Opener, that Opener might not have full values to open.
For ex: After Pass - Pass - ??  I would open 1@s with: @sAQJxx @hxx @dxx @cKxxx  partly as blocking bid 
but also because I have very good spades and "almost" an opening.
The fly in the ointment sits across the table
Partner can only expect a real opening and must bid accordingly 
but you need some protection against getting too high.|pg||at|

This is where Drury comes in, as historically a 2@c response was used to show Major support 
and ask  "Do you have a real opening ?"
In 2/1 we've refined this to include 2@c as Drury with 4-card support 
and 2@d as Drury with 3-card support.
Why the difference? 
Because with a 9-card fit Opener can afford to be more aggressive in bidding game or slam 
or competing if the opponents get involved.|pg||at|

Part of why this works involves 1NT by a passed hand = no longer forcing. 
Because 1NT by a passed hand will never have 3+ cards in opener's Major.
This is what's called semi-forcing, as opener will only rebid with an unbalanced hand 
or with enough HCP to see a possible game opposite a maximum of 11 HCP with no Major fit.
So 2M by a passed hand shows 6-9 with 3-4 trump, 
2@c = 10-11 with 4 cards, 
2@d = 10-11 with 3 cards and 
3M is still preemptive with about 4-7 and 4+ trumps

fp|2|cp|2|at| 


Most of the time, opposite Drury, Opener will bid game directly 
or sign off in 2M = no interest in game over here.
If he's not sure he can bid a new suit as a Help Suit Game Try 
keeping in mind that we're not looking for another trump suit as we've already found our Major fit.|pg||at|

One extra little trick available: After 
Pass  Pass   1M   Pass 
2@c               Pard with a full opener but not sure about game, can rebid 2@d  (artificial = alert) 
                    to say "How good is your hand for Drury? 
                    Do you have a good side suit for tricks? and so on. 
Responder can go back to 2 of the Major with a minimum and no good suit to show.
We'll see lots of these in todays deals|pg||at|

Questions? 
Kibby: What constitutes a good suit?
T: Good suit = KQJx or AKxx, something that'll produce ready tricks
@sKxxx @hKQJx @dQx @cxxx   is better than   @sKJxx @hKx @dQxx @cQxxx 
even though the HCP are the same.

Kibby: Any advantage to reverse drury or 2-way drury?
T: The 2-way simply means: one shows 3-card support and the other 4 and I think that's a huge help.
"Reverse Drury" simply means: going back to 2M is a weak bid, 
while anything else is forward going.
In original Drury  1M - 2@c - 2@d  was weak and anything else was forward going 
- those meanings have been reversed:
The 2@d rebid as a positive hand leaves more room for Responder to show good holdings. 
The only change in thinking is that 2@c or 2@d by a passed hand over 1M can't be used to show clubs or diamonds,
but, hey, who cares about minors?

About the play:
There was an easier way to play and make 12 tricks.
Win the Ace, and play the @sAK and trump a spade.
Back to hand, and trump another spade. Then draw trumps and only lose a @d in the end.
With all the trumps from Ace down to the 6, the Defenders could never overruff|pg||nt||at|
Also, ruffing things in the long trump hand rarely adds to your total of tricks.
Here South already has 6 heart tricks in hand and trumping clubs doesn't add to that 
nor is there any hope of setting up a club trick by trumping.
Trumping clubs looks "busy" but really isn't doing anything positive.

Trumping potential losers in the short hand ^*Bdoes^*N add winners and that's the route to take here.|pg||nt||at|
Note Movie Maker: This was not the way the hand was bid during this session, for "Quiz purposes" I had to show the better bidding
The original bidding went:
1@h    2@c
2@d    4@h and all pass. Here are Paul's comments on that:|pg||nt||at|
The problem with a 2@d rebid is it simply says "I have a good opening , tell me more " 
But that isn't what South really needs to know - specific Ace information is more valuable.

Kibby: Would 4@c be a self splinter?
T: 4@c as a splinter would also work this time except N might choose not to show the @dA 
as the @cQ is wasted opposite a splinter 
so the N hand is effectively reduced to 8 HCP|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: What would South bid if he did not have an opener?
T: If S had a poor opener, he would go back to 2@h over 2@c
If you notice:  North's @cQ is wasted but slam is still very good (and cold)
Kibby: How know that 2@d is not a HSGT?
T:  That's a good question - for HSGT in diamonds after 2@c Drury, Opener needs to rebid 3@d not 2@d !!
so with @sAx @hAQJxx @dJxxx @cKx  after 1@h - 2@c    3@d is a HSGT|pg||nt||at|

The defense slipped a little bit as they can take 3 heart tricks and a club.
With N's low club lead likely to be from an honor and @cKQ10x in dummy, there can't be any gain in South playing back a second club.
So S should switch to a red suit and with dummy equally weak in both , 
S really should chose her stronger red suit (more potential)
Then NS would get their 4 tricks.|pg||nt||at|
As for the lead: Leading from a J high suit is rarely a good plan
Here I would advise the @d9 as a lead|pg||nt||at|

Note Movie Maker: Original bidding: 
1@s   2@d
2@s   all pas|pg||nt||at|
About the bidding:
- Imagine E's clubs were his hearts => 4@s would make
Find out if the hands fit well enough for game (before dummy comes down)
West needs to rebid 2@h and not 2@s 
2@s shows no game interest, (sub)-minimal;  But a good fit might make game.|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: If West rebids  hearts it set's opponents defense  
T: That's a Help Suit Game Try
It may set the defense but wont matter if you get to the right contract.
This time East has no heart help and will return to 2@s - the same spot we reached.
But switch East's @h's and @c's and  a 2@h rebid would get you to game and who cares if the defenders are paying attention 
(they often wont be)|pg||nt||at|
Once Drury confirms a Major fit, by definition we use any new suit bid as HSGT
Kibby: Even though east had passed doesn't she still have a legit limit raise here?
T:  East does have a 3-card limit raise and that's exactly what 2@d Drury says, 
  - without the danger of getting too high opposite a weaker opening
Don't worry about what you might be telling the defenders - if you reach the right spot consistently, that will more than compensate.|pg||nt||at|

4@s makes because the fit was good;    The challenge is to find out that fit in the bidding.

Kibby: Would the singleton heart count as help?
T:  With 5 small hearts, North can see potential if S (who has 4 spades) can help reduce heart losers
and the stiff heart is great help|pg||nt||at|
So after 2@h, South should go right to game.
Kibby: comment on the 3@s bid as opposed to 4@s
T:  4@s is better - focus on the question asked - do you have heart help? If so, bid game, if not, back to 2@s
Kibby:  Ace  K or singleton are useful when asking for side suit help?

The bidding originally went:

4NT   5@c
6@s
(and 4NT should be quantitative, not BLW here)|pg||nt||at| 
The suggested contract would be 6@d,  but 6@s is not a bad contract
BW should almost never be used or applied unless a suit fit has been established.
For the play:|pg||nt||at|
You needed to retain the @dA as a dummy entry
Draw spades and lead towards hearts
So in slam and lead towards the KJ, what do you play?
Since many players lead Aces vs slam and this S didn't, you can assume it's because she didn't have the Ace so play the @hJ

robzim: Could I have made 4?
T:  As it went you could make 4 because of what went on in spades: East showed out on the 3rd round of @s's 
so when dummy led the @s7 and West didn't cover, pitch  a loser.|pg||nt||at|
As for the defense: East might lead a trump with good holdings in both minors to protect from ruffs
But the diamond was ok - except there was no hurry for West to play the @sA
Now I know W wanted to try to give partner a spade ruff but could that happen?
What would East lead if she had a singleton spade?|pg||nt||at|
I would expect the  singlelton to be led if she had it and I know she can't be void in spades 
because that would give N Qxx and she didnt support spades.
So whatever West does, it shouldn't be playing the @sA, a diamond or trump return would be better|pg||nt||at|

Introduction:

Thurston:  We've looked at Jacoby 2NT, Bergen raises, Drury, Constructive single raises.
Now not all players like a lot of conventions and that's OK too.   


BUT - for maximum accuracy in the game and slam zone with Majors, you need tools
In the 1960-s and 70s the US constantly lost World Events to the Italians and analysis 
shows the major reason was a difference in approach to major suit game and slam bidding.
If you aren't yet using the methods we've discussed here, grab a good partner 
and work on your bidding with at least some of the approaches. 


Also, we looked at Help Suit Game Tries and they are very effective.
The old method of 1@h - 2@h - 3@h  to invite game just isn't accurate enough 
and will cause many missed games when the two hands fit well 
but have less than 25-26 HCP combined.


I have some challenging major suit deals for today so let's get at them.

Declarer correctly worked on his side suit tricks in diamonds before drawing  trump.
Why?    Because he needed the 10@h as an entry in case diamonds were 4-2.
As long as diamonds were no worse than 4-2, North could count 2@s tricks, 6@h , 3@d and 1@c = 12|pg||nt||at|

Now - how do we bid this very good slam?
North has very good trumps but only 13 HCP 
while South has lots of HCP and a good diamond suit but not a great heart fit.

In 2/1 we use a lot of "picture " bids - a bonus due to the 2/1 response being a 100% game force.|pg||at|
So here after 1@h - 2@d   
North can rebid 3@h since that is a "picture" bid, 100% guaranteeing 6+ solid hearts.

It's not like the Standard bid showing extra HCP to force to game because South already forced to game.
Now South will realize trumps are solid - 
something she might have worried about with only 10x as support.|pg||at|
She can also see all her good controls and diamonds as a source of tricks.

so after 1@h - 2@d - 3@h    South can take control with Blackwood and bid 6@h 
because she can see the hands fit so well, there are controls, no trump loser(s) 
and a source of tricks and that's a recipe for slam.|pg||nt||

The problem is that the 2@h rebid doesn't describe North's hand very well.
The heart suit could be KJxxxx and slam would be lousy at best.
Put yourself in the South seat and "see" a solid 6 card suit and an opening bid with Partner.
Isn't that more telling than a simple 2@h rebid?|pg||at|

Kibby: Paul, is that 3@h bid limited or could North also hold the K of clubs in addition to the current holding and still bid 3@h?|pg||at|
Thurston: Yes, the 3@h biddder could also have the club K, but BLW will find that out.

There's another small problem as 2@h could be a "default" rebid 
with something  like  @sKQx @hKQxxx  @dQx  @cxxx
With the sample hand, Opener can't raise diamonds, 
shouldn't rebid NT at the 2 level with an unstopped suit, 
so has to make the "default" (=nothing else fits) rebid of 2@h 
and that doesn't promise 6 hearts.|pg||at|

Kibby: :  How solid is "solid"
Thurston: "solid" = AKQJxx|pg||nt||

Kibby: Even with N's 2@h rebid can South continue by cue bidding controls?   
Once a GF has been established?
Thurston: Since 2@h doesn't promise 6+@h's, 
you can't cuebid without a fit and no fit can be presumed after 2@h 
and Responder doesn't have enough hearts to raise the suit when it might be 5.|pg||at|

Dixie_08: Don't we have to show support first before showing controls? 
Thurston:  Yes Dixie you have to show support before controls are shown 
and 10x isn't adequate support opposite a 2@h rebid.
After 1@h - 2@d - 2@h  ? Responder should really rebid 2NT to ask for more info.
once 2@d sets up a GF, Responder can rebid 2NT over 2@h as a "tell me more" stall, 
because you're always going to game in any case.|pg||at|

Kibby: Would you please redefine "picture bids"
Thurston:  Here a picture bid is a jump in openers M over a 2/1 response to show a solid suit.|pg||at|
Another picture bid might happen after 1@s - 2@h  
where 4@h shows 4-card support, no shortness  and a minimum opening 
so something like @sAQxxx  @hKQJx  @dxx  @cxx
Picture bids can happen at the 2, 3 or 4 level depending on context, although rare at the 2 level.|pg||at|

Kibby: Solid always J deep or is Q deep okay with 7 + card suits?
Thurston:  maybe AKQ10xxx with 7 but be contrite if you lose a trick to the Jack!|pg||nt||

You have to plan what dummy assets you're going to use.

Here you couldn't trump anything in Dummy but the nice long diamond suit had promise of a length trick or 2
You would end with 1@s trick, 5@h's, 4@d and 1@c for 11.|pg||nt||at|
In the bidding East did well to open 1@h even though balanced and in range (15-17) for 1NT
It's Ok to open 1NT with a 5 card M but not with a tip top maximum and all aces and a very good suit.
Although even after 1NT you'd still get to game but likely 3NT and make 9 tricks
The 2@h raise we define as "constructive" because it will have 8-10 HCP and a 3-card support, 
a much tighter and more accurate range than the standard 6-9|pg||nt||at|

One tiny improvement in the play could  be made:
After the trump lead brought the J, dummy's 9 was equal with the AKQ10
So it was right to draw only  one more trump and save one for a diamond ruff.
But draw the second trump with a high card from hand so that when a diamond is trumped with the 9, 
it would be impossible for anyone to overuff.|pg||nt||at|
Thurston:  as for the lead, the late, great Edgar Kaplan used to say that when you were dealt AK it's so you wouldn't have to guess what to lead        and with AKQ even more so.
West should really lead a top club, take a trick (hopefully) , look at dummy 
and plan what to do next - that's the value of leading a top card from AKQ|pg||nt||at|
kyno40: Because of my @d holding, I led trump
Thurston:  but if S really has long diamonds and will try to trump them in dummy, 
East will also be short in diamonds and will be able to overuff|pg||nt||at|

Well played by Dot|pg||nt||sc||up|52|sk||pf|y|at|
The key was not to take the heart finesse.
If you take it and it loses (finesses always lose in lesson hands!!!)
Then North can play another club to force West to trump again
If Declarer draws the last trump, South will take club tricks when in with diamond Ace.|pg||nt||at|
Thurston:  and if the last trump of N's isn't drawn she will take a trick with it eventually
But 4@S tricks, 4@H and 2@D = 10 without a finesse - well done!|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: So throw out that old adage ?   8 ever 9 never?
Thurston:  Old adages are good for sewing on cushions or wall hangings
thinking is better for bridge.
8 ever, 9 never isn't wrong - you just have to be careful about when to apply it.|pg||nt||at|
About the bidding:
After 1NT forcing, West has to rebid but what?
As suggested by someone, 2@S is a reverse = more hearts than spades but 16+ HCP 
so West isn't strong enough and 2@H over 1NT = 6+ cards in the suit.
That leaves the rebid of a 3-card minor as the only choice: 2@d|pg||nt||at|
Thurston:  after West rebids 2@D, 
East can jump to 3@H to show: 10-12 HCP with 3-card hearts = a ^*B"3-card limit raise"^*N.
With minimum HCP but some shape, West will accept the invite and bid 4@H
Until support has been shown , the West hand really is minimum 
as the singleton may be worthless without a fit.|pg||nt||at|
And as asked, suppose you had:  @sKJxx  @hAQxxx  @dxx  @cKx and the same start:  1@H - 1NT - ?
You'd be in a tough spot for a rebid,
not enough HCP for 2@S, not enough @H's for 2@H and certainly not enough for 2NT
Better to not "lie" about a Major or strength so the system rebid is 2@C|pg||nt||at|
eternaluke: Flannery :)

nobody ever believes club bids anyway.
dee_dee_20: may Flannery  RIP:)
Thurston:  and partner will only pass 2@C with  5@c's and 1 Heart 
so where else would you want to be?|pg||nt||at|
It's rare anyway but lies about Major's and strength are more often fatal than being short a club or 2
Kibby: I thought there are times you do rebid a 5 carder in the 2/1 system?  (which actually bothers me :) 
Thurston:  you only rebid a 5-carder after a 2/1 response when you're going to get another chance
 -after 1@H - 1NT - 2@H     there may not be another chance!|pg||nt||at|
Kibby: So if P makes a 2/1 bid, are you required to have the other suits stopped to rebid NT? 
Thurston: Yes, for ex.: 
1@s - 2@d
2NT   For the NT rebid Opener would need something close to a stopper in hearts and diamonds

@sAQxxx  @hKxx  @dQ10x  @cJx   would do as a minimum.|pg||nt||at|
You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish, the lead was the @cQ

The suggested bidding:

|cs|1|at||ia|o1H1N2D3H4H|at|

After the 1NT Forcing, West has to rebid, but what?
2@s is a reverse: more hearts than spades, but also promisses 16+ HCP  (others suggest 17+)
And West isn't strong enough.  
2@h would promise a 6+ card heart  => That leaves the rebid of a 3-card minor as only choice:  2@d

After West rebid of 2@d,  East can jump to  3@h = 10-12 HCP and a "3-card limit raise"
West, with a minimum in HCP (13) but some shape, can accept the invitation  =>  4@h

Until support has been shown, the West hand really is minimum
as a singleton may be worthless without a fit.|pg||nt||

Thurston:  in the bidding, we don't usually use Bergen as a passed hand.
Instead, ^*BDrury^*N takes the place with:
2@C = 9-11 and 4 card support, 
2@D = 9-11 with 3 card support and 2M = 6-8 with 3-4 card support.
here all roads lead to 4@S|

Thurston:  once the club losers were ruffed in dummy, we should just draw trump and end E/W's misery
But making 4 was good.
dee_dee_20: working on my cross ruffing sorry :)
Declarer just has to be careful to not draw trumps too soon - need to ruff clubs 
Thurston:  no danger with Dee - needed the cross-ruff practice and NEVER drew trumps!|pg||nt||at|

The preemptive raise is very descriptive - always 4+ trumps and about 4-6 vul and maybe even less when not vul

The idea is that you're exploiting the trump fit to use up space 
that the opponents might use to advantage|pg||nt||at|
And yes, I'd still use when opponents are passing because they might not pass forever 
and because it's an accurate description of the bidder's fit.

Just recently we had P - 1@H - P - 3@H - all pass 
and the opponents were cold for 5@d and couldn't safely get in.|pg||nt||at|
Kibby:  so Bergen here, not Drury?
Thurston:  no 3@H isn't a Bergen raise, just a preemptive raise and can be used with or independently of Bergen raises.
So by passed hand you have:  
^*B2M   3M^*N, 
2@C and 2@D and  ^*B4M^*N    as ways to raise   (with 2@C and @D = ^*BDrury^*N)|pg||nt||

Thurston:  well done in the play
Could we get to game?|pg||at|
North starts with 14 HCP and Opposite 9-11 might have a chance for 10 tricks.
real weakness is clubs
So after the fit has been found 1@S - 2@D  (Drury) N could rebid 3@C as a Help Suit Game Try|pg||nt||at|
Thurston:  Kx and a max 2@d bid is good enough for 4@S
dee_dee_20: the @hK is bad news
Thurston: The Singelton @hK is neither good nor bad
Might be good opposite Axx or QJx in hearts
What I do is count it as 3 HCP until I know it's useless.|pg||nt||at|
But don't add anything for it being a singleton as well.
dee_dee_20:  So  with Kx in clubs   I count no wasted values?
Thurston:  What you don't want to do is get mired in accountancy - adding for this, subtracting for that, 
adjusting for the time of year, colour of an opp's sweater, etc
Kx looks like it can reduce losers - down to 1 if the Ace is onside, at most 2 if Ace offside and partner doesn't have  the Q|pg||nt||at|
Thurston:  thank you all for being so attentive and patient with my typos! We'll see you again at BBO 
or maybe a real life event somewhere,  sometime|pg||nt||
