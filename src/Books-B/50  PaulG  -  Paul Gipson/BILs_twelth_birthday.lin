ht|c|fp|3|cs|1|at|^c{Introduction:}|
fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2Eventhost: In honour of BIL's 12th Birthday Celebration, I would like to welcome Paul Gipson back to the BILies Retreat.
Paul has been a long time favourite and has given much of his time to mentoring and teaching new BIL members.  
Paulg has played bridge for about thirty-five years, starting in a local club and progressing quickly to tournaments. His regular bridge partner is brother Alex with whom he plays in most major UK tournaments 
and the occasional Summer NABC in the USA.  
Paul's favourite bridge memory is playing the Nickell team in the Spingold. 
Paul plays in the English Premier League and has also been the non-playing captain of Scotland Open and Women's teams. He spends a lot of time coaching Scottish international pairs.  Using BBO plays a major 
part to help them prepare for competition, particularly setting practice matches and partnership bidding tables.
Paul, along with wife Helen, lives in the Scottish Borders and enjoys walking his dogs in the beautiful countryside. Helen is one of the world's leading Scrabble players but does play bridge and together they have won county and national mixed pairs events.

Paul says his real aim as a mentor is to help with consistent play. This means discipline in bidding and forming a plan when declaring and defending. He finds that the problem most BIL members have is not a limit to their knowledge but the ability to apply the right bit of knowledge in a timely fashion! 
So he concentrates on teaching players to understand the basics and the inferences that can be taken from a course of action.

@h@h  Let's give a warm BILies welcome to Paul Gipson @h@h

|fp||cp||at|Check the BIL library at bilbridge.com for Paul's great articles and tips for playing better bridge.
(Explore BIL:  Bridge Notes - Teachers:   Paulg: ) 
Paul also keeps one of the most active bridge blogs and provides regular updates on his on-line and off-line adventures. Check it out at           ^*Hwww.thebeercard.blogspot.com ^*N

up|52|at|paulg: Well done, so a very simple first hand but I think Rosemary's bidding is interesting
Who would open 1@c and who would open 1@d?
I think it really depends what you are taught, and perhaps where you are taught
I'm pretty flexible on what I open, but the key is to know what you will ^*brebid^*n
and to make sure that you have a sensible rebid|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: Here, Rosemary plans to rebid 1NT if Catherine responds 1@s
So it doesn't really matter which minor you open 
Some will open the 'better' minor
Some always 1@d with 4-4, others 1@c with 4-4 |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at| 
Who would raise 1@h to 2@h as Rosemary did?
azin: I am not in LOVE with 2@h bid by North
paulg: Rosemary would be next in the guillotine in some countries for raising with 3 hearts particularly in France|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|lukie2too: I would bid 2@c rather than 2@h - she doesn't know how many @h's Catherine has
paulg: I would either raise to 2@h or rebid 1NT
I really dislike 2@c, to be honest, because that sounds like an unbalanced hand
lukie2too: no stopper in @s's?
paulg: When you hold a weak no-trump, it is to be expected that you do not stop every every suit
So I don't mind 2@h or 1NT, but here 2@h certainly makes the auction easier
azin: So they may end in 7-6 trump fit|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: If a partnership does raise regularly with 3-card support, then you cannot just jump to game in the suit when you only hold four yourself ... you need a more delicate approach. But with five hearts, no problem here.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
Although the play looked simple, Rosetown could have been more careful .. 
drawing all the trumps immediately, then cashing the @dK and unblocking the clubs overtaking the @c10 to enter dummy

LadyStar17: partner... spell is optional  LOL |

|nt||at|paulg: In the play, Anne (east) could have gone up with a club honour to hold the contract, as the cards lie.
The best line is play the spade after drawing trumps, planning to play a diamond towards the King.
When the @sJ drops, you can discard a club and play for the overtrick.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: The auction shows the problem that many of us have bidding strong hands.
In general, we overbid good hands and underbid bad hands, and North overbid and South underbid here,
but 2@c-2@d-3@h is a good start.     3@h should SET THE SUIT
It says we are playing in hearts whatever partner holds.
So South's job is now to show her values, so 3@s, cue bidding the @sA is the best response.
Now Rosemary can show her club control with 4@c and Catherine can sign off with 4@h, nothing more to show.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: Of course Rosemary may now continue ... as Catherine may hold the @cK
and I think 5@d is the best bid ... saying I control the diamonds, do you have anything else?
As Catherine does not, they will play in 5@h, but they will have had a far more descriptive auction.
LadyStar17: I was not willing to just stop at 4@h ... thought 5 might say... do  you have anything ??
paulg: The reason that Rosemary should not jump to 5@h is that she has already shown a very strong hand by opening 2@c and rebidding 3@h|

up|52|
at|paulg:  One piece of advice I always give BIL players is to take their time at trick 1 when playing the contract .. make a plan before following from dummy... even if there is a singleton there
This is the type of hand where, as kibitzers, we can see how to make lots of tricks
...and we also see that Anne could have gone down if Rosemary had played the @hQ instead of another spade at trick 7
It's a lot easier game when you can see all 52 cards, and the real difference between the BIL and experts is that the experts will try to build a picture of how the 52 cards lie.
When you are worrying about everything on the hand, it is far more difficult
|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: Winning the spade and taking the club finesse was a good idea.
Now you were probably best cashing the top hearts, if the queen falls, then you have the rest.
If not, then you'll need to only lose one diamond .... if they switch to them...
So it is a mistake to try and get diamond ruffs, since the defence can prevent you doing that
So club finesse, then trumps is best|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: In the auction, I'm not a huge fan of West's 2@c but it worked out well
Carol did well though, as she did not pass 3@h which must be forcing
lukie2too: I counted my hcp + length and shortness
KangaRhu: What should Carol have bid other than 2@c Paul?
paulg: 1NT is the alternative to 2@c  (if you are playing Acol, then 2@c is absolutely fine)
but SAYC or 2/1, you need more in terms of values....and shortage is most valuable when you have a fit|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|LadyStar17: Was there a possible play for a spade game?
paulg: You have two heart losers, a diamond loser and a club loser
so one down when the ace of clubs is onside
however, my rule is that I never sacrifice at this vulnerability.
You would only bid 4@s if you think there is a chance to make it
and as you can see, if the club is offside then you can easily go two down for -500|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|
paulg: and three down is a complete disaster when vulnerable against non-vulnerable
so I am very conservative at this vulnerability.
Okay, we'll swap the players around now.

at|paulg: Well done Barb, safely made the contract but you could have safely made an overtrick too ...
because you made quite an advanced play by ruffing all of dummy's spades (emptying the hand of spades)
Instead of just cashing the last two clubs and @hA, you could have led your final diamond.
Whoever wins this (and with luck west) would have to lead hearts or give you a ruff and discard.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|lukie2too: Would you have overcalled 1@d with the west hand?
paulg: Before we get to the auction, Donna should really have won the first trick with the @dK
then partner would know that Donna probably had the @dA
So Barb, were you always opening 1@c or did you consider something else?
bclavey: I was thinking of 1NT but noticed 2 doubletons
paulg: I think the two doubletons are a negative, but I really dislike having to rebid 2@c if partner responded 1@d|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: So I think I'd have opened 1NT because I want to get the strength of the hand across.
And the only reason I'd open 1@c is because I think the hand is too strong for 1NT ... that club suit does look pretty good 
I would not object to an auction like 1@c-1@d-2NT
There was a question whether West should overcall 1@d ... I don't think so at this vulnerability|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: North's pass cannot be criticised, although I know some players who would bid!
Wayne_LV: How about X for takeout, hand revalues to 15 dummy pts in support of any unbid
paulg: I think most expect more HCP for a vulnerable takeout double, partner is liable to get overexcited
So, should Donna really balance in the 4th seat?
Can you list some pros and cons to help Donna with the decision?|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: CON: three small clubs, worst possible holding
PRO: partner might have balanced 14 points without a bid
CON: no 4-card major and partner did not overcall a major
PRO: who wants to play in 1@c?
CON: partner could not bid over 1@c|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: I think it's very close decision, but I'd pass
DonnaS: I would still balance with 1nt, question is - do I want to give south another bid?
azin: Donna could have added one of her diamonds from her fingers (now with five diamonds) and bid 1D ?
bassplayer: Wondering about a diamond overcall here, it is low, and u can pass any bid by p.  
This is a tough one.  Any action is "FWD"     Fraught With Danger
paulg: One thing you will see is that I take vulnerability into account when making 'fraught with danger' actions |

up|44|at|paulg: Well played and defended, but we'd like to be in game, specifically 3NT
rupaulg: In the USA, many play 3@d as forcing here
paulg: In the UK, it is definitely non-forcing.
I was saying to the kibitzers that Barb's 3@d call is treated differently around the world, 
some think it is game forcing, some think it is invitational.
So the real key for a partnership is to have an agreement|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: One option is to rebid 3@c with Barb's hand, a natural bid showing game values, instead of 3@d
This is what I'd bid in the UK, where 3@d is definitely not forcing.
This leaves N with a very simple 3NT bid holding @hAQ (although may be tempted by 3@s in case P has 5 @s's)
But it's always difficult in a new partnership, especially in the BIL, because knowing which bids are forcing and which are non-forcing is never as clear as you'd wish.|

MM: How about rebidding 1NT with the N hand? 
VERY crummy diamonds and gives Partner the opportunity for a MF bid (if she has one) after bidding a Major?

jules101: Very solid preempt
learning4: Shouldn't preempt with 4-card Major in a side suit
DonnaS: Garrazzo says that not opening with a side four card Major is for old people
spunkers: I think too strong for preempt|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: I think one of the 'rules' we're often taught is not to pre-empt with a side 4-card Major
But if you watch the experts on vugraph, they don't seem to care, so I don't care either.
But I do think this hand is too strong for 3@s, and would rather open 1@s myself
Two Aces, good 7-card suit and a void make it too good for a pre-empt.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: I think Bonnie did well to raise the pre-empt, some would have passed
bassplayer: It had nice controls
paulg: When you hold the spade suit, there is less pressure to pre-empt because you can overbid them
Okay, we'll have our final switch of players, thanks everyone|

up|36|at|paulg: North's play of the trump suit worked out very well
Normally you'd play the Ace first, but here East's bidding suggested short diamonds so Susan's play easily best and spectacularly successful this time.|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


nt||at|paulg: I think South's 2@c bid worked out well, but I'm not a great fan of 5-card overcalls at the two-level, that is.
If you play the unusual 2NT, then this would have been an option, you get to show 10 cards rather than just 5,
especially as you expect the bidding to be at 4@s when it comes back to you.
But the rest of the auction was well controlled by everyone.

up|36|at|paulg: If south covers the @hQ then I'll think you'll only make 10 tricks, so you don't want to be  in game
(MM: After south signals the @c10 at trick 1 which gives declarer a club trick, as she knows location of @cA )
West had an interesting problem over the 1NT response. 
Her hand does not look like a NT hand but she is not guaranteed to find a fit by rebidding 2@d
If partner is 3-3-2-5 or, worse, 3-3-1-6, then 2@d will not score well
I'd have probably passed 1NT since most people lead Majors which looks helpful
but it is a problem with inverted minors that you cannot make a simple raise to 2@d

up|24|pf|y|at|paulg: Well bid Liz and Susan
spunkers: Guess I shouldn't have doubled
paulg: I think it was unlucky that 5@c could make ...
learning4: I take all the credit for the play of the hand
paulg: but I also think it was a little pessimistic to think that you could not make 5@h when partner had made a raise to 3@h
also, if you bid 5@h they may well sacrifice in 6@c even when you cannot make 5@h
When partner raises you missing all those top trumps, she is likely to have some distributional help|

nt||at|paulg: But these high-level decisions are never easy and are the one subject that the international pairs want to practice.
It is certainly the area that differentiates experts and world-class players
No-one gets them all right, but the world-class players get more of them right
So thanks everyone for playing this evening!
hallway: @d@d  THANK YOU  Paul (PaulG)  - for this informative session,  it is great to have you  back .
