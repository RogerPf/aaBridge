ht|c|fp|3|cs|1|at|^c{"A Toast to Rabbie Burns"-tourney: Introduction}|
fp|2|cp|2|cs|3|ht|f|at|^b@2"Welcome members, Teachers, Honours, Mentors and all to the "A Toast to Rabbie Burns" tourney"  

There were be 8 boards, selected by "paulg".  They are the first eight boards of a Scottish match against the Auld Enemy...the Scots won!
"anba" was the TD, and "Galadriel" did the review after the tourney in the BIL Lounge.
Anne played all these hands in Lille at the Olympiad



* "paulg": Paul Gipson, our table host today. Non-playing Captain of Scotland Open and Women's teams. Paul spends a lot of time coaching Scottish international pairs and is a well known contributor to the BIL Library. Paul has prepared a complete commentary of today's hands which will be posted in the BIL Library.  

* "Galadriel": Anne Symons, a Diamond Life Master. Anne has been a regular member of the Scottish Ladies Team, playing in several European championships (Lady Milne, Camrose and European Ladies) and the Olympiads.  
She and her partner were also the first (and only so far) woman's pair to represent the Open Team.  Anne works full-time as a pharmacist but still has time to juggle bridge with other parts of her life. 

* "anba": Anne Brodie-Allan, our TD extraordinaire.  Anne hosts numerous tourneys on BBO. Anne has been a Scottish Bridge Union Accredited teacher for 15 years and is a SBU Accredited District TD. 
After years of working in the television and pharmaceutical industry, she is now retired and is "Grannie Annie" to twin grandsons.|pg||nt||fp|2|cp|2|at|^b@2






anba: The Scottish poet Robert 'Rabbie' Burns was born on January 25, 1759 in Alloway, Ayrshire, at what is now know as Burns Cottage.
The day of his birth is celebrated today throughout the world as Burns Night.
The Celebration is in the form of a Burns Supper.
It is a very simple meal usually starting with a Scotch Broth (soup)
Then Haggis is traditionally served at a Burns supper with "neeps and tatties" (that is swede or turnip and potatoes, boiled and mashed separately)
Some of the "Posh" suppers add a Bonnie Prince Charlie Sauce.
Will give you Instructions on making it later...|pg||nt||fp|2|cp|2|at|^b@2

JohnTaylor: Is it true that haggis are alive and kicking on the Yorkshire moors ?
paulg: I'm not going to say what is actually in a haggis, but it is illegal to import them into the USA
anba: We prefer to keep them in Scotland !!:)
Chatter1: Didn't you know that we have haggis shoots up here ?
2pandora: That is a libelist rumour... they live in Inverurie!!!!
MrsD12345: Independance for Inverurie!
madtrumper: I guess Scottish tournaments attract a rowdy bunch
hallway: ach but some have escaped and can be found  down here -   a well done haggis is a bonnie thing and the wee dram  washes it down with style 
JohnTaylor: I've seen some odd creatures roaming the moors at night I wondered if one might be haggis ? Maureen I hear that the NZ Haggis is more hairy and has a sweeter flavour ..
Hairy because they live higher up the mountain side
madtrumper: Do they use hobbits?
hallway: well the hobbits may well be partial to a bit of haggis they certainly like their wee dram 
robzim:    Haggis is my second most favorite dish after Marmite 

etc.....etc..... 

anba: Here is the link to one of my favourite Burns poems set to music
"My Love is Like a Red Red Rose" sung by Kenneth McKellar. Love his voice hope you all do too!

pg||ub|1|mb|2n|pg||mb|p3n|pg||nt||mb|ppp|at|paulg:  So I guess all the North players opened 1@c, did everyone bid Michaels?
I guess not everyone plays Michaels Cue Bids, but for those who do play Michaels it is a nice hand to bid it on
galadriel: It's nice when you are 5/5 in majors to be able to get that over in 1 bid
paulg:  With all your points in the majors|pg||nt||at|paulg:  Generally experts worry more about the distribution, 5-5, rather than points
galadriel: I think it's something to discuss with partner - how to bid over Michaels interference :)
paulg:  Yes, one good reason to bid Michaels is that many partnerships do not know what to bid over it
That is probably a good subject for a BIL Lesson
By the way, West bid spades so that she could compete in hearts later
For example, if N/S had subsided in 3@c, West could bid 3@h just competing
That way you will find your best fit|pg||nt||at|
galadriel: They played in 5@C at the other table for 1 IMP to us :)

I think it was passed out at a few tables, and one got to game
Big difference! :)
paulg:  I'm afraid that everyone who passed it will never make an international player because you CAN count
galadriel: Well, I decided to open as South
paulg:  The English Lady sitting South also opened 1@d|pg||nt||mb|p|pg||mb|1d|pg||mb|p|pg||mb|1sp1np2nppp|at|galadriel: I was lucky - the @H lead gave me 2 tricks in that suit
paulg:  Everything is very friendly, partner has 11 points and you scrape home with 8 tricks
galadriel: and I ran the @S10 early to set up my 8th trick
paulg:  Which suggests passing it out is a pretty good decision by most of you|pg||nt||at|paulg:  There is a Rule that many people use for deciding whether to open dubious hands in the 4th seat
It is called the 'Rule of 15'
You add your high-card points to the number of spades in your hand
If that adds up to 15 or more, then it is okay to open
This hand just meets that rule :)|pg||nt||at|paulg:  But, if you are playing with Anne, then I think you should pass hands like this because she will be weaker than the hand shown here, and there is no need to open light in 4th seat, when your partner has failed to open light in 2nd!
So knowing your partner's habits is important for the decision
galadriel: I think if you have a style where you like to open light, you have to have good brakes :)
paulg:  or play the hands like Fantoni
galadriel: Ah, chance would be a fine thing|pg||nt||at|

3 |pn|S A,england,galadriel,england|sv|e|mb|2c|at|paulg:  I think you should all have started like this, if you play a system where 2@c is the strong bid|pg||nt||mb|p2d|at|paulg:  2@d is either negative or relay, depending on your system, so most bid 2@d whatever it means|pg||nt||mb|p3cp|at|paulg:  3@c is natural and GAME FORCING
This means partner is NOT ALLOWED TO PASS
(Unless you are playing Benj Acol, 2@c is game forcing unless you rebid 2NT to show 22-23 balanced)
So there is no need to jump in this situation|pg||nt||mb|3sp|at|galadriel: Well, I failed miserably on this hand, and many of you did much better than I - maybe some of you should take over this commentary! :)
I'm afraid, I took a really pessimistic view, holding a singleton in pd's suit, and bid 3NT in stead of 3@s
paulg:  However, now you have an interesting problem, what do you bid now?
Any votes?|pg||nt||at|
arya_01:  5@c
aliceland2:  I bid 4 diamonds
arya_01:  4@d is likely to pass
|pg||nt||at|paulg:  partner is never passing 4@d as you are in a game forcing auction
Anne bid 3NT, which I think is a bit wet
galadriel: 4@D is the winning bid :)
paulg:  4@d hits the jackpot this time, but it is hard to look beyond the club suit|pg||nt||mb|4dp|at|paulg:  If you bid 5@c, then that will be the end of the auction as you know partner will never be able to raise without a red ace
galadriel: If you want to be in the Grand Slam, it has to be in @D, which only needs a 3-2 break|pg||nt||mb|4sp6cppp|at|paulg:  6@c is fairly practical
Let's look at the problem the english 'experts' had
After 4@c, it sounds like South only has one suit ... so now bids by North are cue bids for slam and the diamond fit is lost
aflac:  What is the 4s bid saying?
paulg:  4@s just says I have the ace or king of spades, which,of course, is valueless to South|pg||nt||at|paulg:  Even @sAK is of no value if you cannot get to them
Bidding after 2@c is very difficult and testing
And here we see two top international pairs not only missing a grand slam, but not even bidding a small slam
galadriel: At some tables, where the @D fit was found - they got to the grand slam|pg||nt||at|paulg:  So I think there are three lessons: 
(1) Big hands are difficult to bid 
(2) you want to be sure when you bid a grand slam because they may be in game in the other room 
(3) we all make mistakes|pg||nt||at|galadriel: Well done all those who got to slam :)
gowanlock: can u show the 4@D slam bidding sequence please, paul
paulg:  In diamonds you can pitch the dummy's losers on clubs
It's hard to be scientific at this level but they'll have bid it something like this
4@d over 3@s is presumed natural|pg||nt||at|paulg:  But these auctions are very difficult for anyone
gowanlock: So first call of @D is for suit and not cue bid?
galadriel: Phillip, that is a very good point. You have to have an agreement
We play that after a 2@C opener the opener can now bid 2 suits naturally
But responder can only bid one naturally|pg||nt||at|
paulg:  It is a reason you will see good players try not to open 2@c with two-suited hands
although this one is just too strong so has to be opened with it
gowanlock: ty - that is a great approach
galadriel: It's an easy rule to remember :)|pg||nt||at|

4|pn|galadriel,england,S A,england|sv|b|mb|1c|at|paulg:  So, unlike Anne, East-West open 1@c when they hold a 12-14 1NT hand|pg||nt||mb|p1dp|at|paulg:  East makes a strange decision to bid 1@d rather than bid a weak 3@c
Since East is a multiple world-champion I shouldn't really argue with her :)|pg||nt||mb|2dppp|at|galadriel: I felt a bit wimpish selling out to 2@D
paulg:  Yes, but the worry is that partner will bid clubs if you double
But I still think you are worth 2@s|pg||nt||at|galadriel: But I was glad when I saw the full hand!
paulg:  It is interesting that if East had bid 3@c (weak), then you would have bid 3@s
But on this auction you sold out to 2@d
So EW made ten tricks in 2@d for +130|pg||nt||at|paulg:  The Scottish EW pair did bid quickly to 3@c and South was forced to bid 3@s, which went three for -300 and 5 imps to Scotland
galadriel: 5 IMPs to the good guys :)|

5|pn|galadriel,england,pard,england|mb|pp1NTp2cp2dp3nppp|at|paulg:  So this is a pretty boring board and was flat in 3NT
galadriel: I think some of you were playing a weak NT - is that right?
paulg:  some will be
galadriel: The question is - do you compete with the West hand?
And do you show a single suiter? Or try to show both majors?|pg||nt||at|galadriel: over 1NT - especially at this vulnerability - I prefer showing that as a single suiter, as the disparity is too great between the suits
Although showing @H's would have worked well here
paulg:  This is actually a very nasty position if you've opened 1@d
Has any spotted how to beat 3NT if played by South?|pg||nt||at|
West needs to lead the Ace and Queen of clubs
On any other lead South can create two spades, two hearts and four diamonds / five diamonds
But on a club lead, West can lead to partner's @sA and she can cash the @cK and @c10
galadriel: If anyone found that lead - we are nominating you for the Bols Brilliancy prize :)

but in Scotland we have the 'Aberdeen' double, which shows support for the other three suits with four cards in the openers suit!
anba: WATCH IT PAUL I am from Aberdeen !! It is the SHIRE who play that :):) 
galadriel: I thought that was now known ( in Aberdeen at least) as an Italian double since the Italians seem to use it all the time - to great effect :)|pg||nt||mb|p1hx|at|paulg:  Not quite an Aberdeen double but pretty close|pg||nt||mb|r2sp3spp4d4sppp|at|galadriel: Another poor effort from me
paulg:  Anne's bidding as South here shows that she did not think it was really an opening bid
galadriel: By not supporting pd immediately, she couldn't picture such good @Ds
paulg:  I'm not a fan of North's redouble with nothing in spades|pg||nt||at|paulg:  I think North should just bid naturally, as it is likely that a big spade bid is about to come
East had clearly seen her partner's doubles before...
England bid to 5@d in the other room to level the match at 9-9 imps|pg||nt||at|

galadriel: Well, you may not all approve of my opening bid ....
paulg:  1@d is very normal, Anne upgraded, or can't count :)
(paulg:  strong notrump, 5-card majors) 
galadriel: I'll tell you my thinking|pg||nt||at|galadriel: If I opened 1@D, I'd have to rebid 2@D
As I'm way too good for a weak 1NT rebid, and not quite good enough for 3@D
So, that left me with a strong NT
paulg:  I think many people would upgrade
gowanlock: did your partner call the Director on your bid? :)
galadriel: lol
zeitgeis:  1NT with two doubletons?|pg||nt||mb|1np3sp4sxppp|at|
galadriel: Yes, but Qx is sometimes a nice holding for NT
paulg:  so 3@s is invitational?
galadriel: 3@S is invitational with a 6 card suit, so, in for a penny...
paulg:  Not the strongest invite I've ever seen, to be honest|pg||nt||at|paulg:  Well, we've all seen that Anne has upgraded her hand from 14 points to show a 15-17 1NT
So I'm sure we all know what she'll do when facing an invite
galadriel: I think we both did a bit overbidding on this hand!
People are asking about tranfers|pg||nt||at|galadriel: Our methods are that if you transfer to a major, then raise to 3, that is a slam try
So, the invitational version is to bid 3 immediately
You pays your money, takes your choice :)
paulg:  Response methods over 1NT vary enormously between expert pairs
So this contract has no chance, two club losers and two diamonds are automatic|pg||nt||at|paulg:  oops!
I don't know why West went wrong, but knowing her I'm sure she blamed East
How many imps do you think this cost EW?|pg||at|
paulg:  only about 4 imps
Since in the other room the Scottish EW bid and MADE 4@h, so this was 16 imps to Scotland
The English North-South did not have Anne's flair and opened 1@d which let EW find their heart fit|pg||nt||at|

"Balanced hands open or rebid notrump"
