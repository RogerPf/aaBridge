cp|Re|at |^b@2
Boldbida: |cp||at|A good bidder always makes sure that they first think of exactly what message they would like to convey to the partner. The primary objective of every bid MUST be to:
- ask partner a question ^^| pg||
at|- send a response back to partner, or^^| pg||
at|- inform partner about a decision just made ^^| pg||

at|^^Bad bidders bid to describe their hand. Good bidders bid having a target in mind.^^|pg||
at|^^Here is how to set up a target:|pg||
at|^^- When partner opens one of a suit or 1NT assume they opened with a minimum holding (13PTS for suit opening and 15-17 PTS for NT).|pg||
at|^^- To this number add your points |pg||
at|^^- Divide the sum by 3 and discard any fraction|pg||
at|^^- Add 1 to this answer (see chaper on frozen suits for partial explanation).|pg||
at|^^- This should give you the 'base' number of tricks that your side can expect to make.|pg||
at|^^- If you find a fit (8 cards or better) then add 1 more trick|pg||
at|^^- If you can't quickly find a fit then bid to play NT |pg||
at|^^ 
Let's look at an example to demonstrate this:|pg||nt||

cp|Re|at |^b@2
Boldbida: |cp||at|Some of you were reluctant to bid 3NT. The truth is that if you have the range of points and can't find an 8 card fit, there is a very good chance that your side has a stopper in every suit and you can play 3NT. You should, however, take into account the defensive ability of your opponents and the declarer ability of your partner. |pg||

cp|Re|at |^^ ^b@2
Boldbida: |cp||at|Also remember that you are trying to be correct 70%-75% of the time!  |pg||

cp|Re|at |^b@2
Boldbida: |cp||at|Let's look at another set. In this case all four suits are frozen as well. 
Frozen suits are difficult to notice but trained delcarer and good defenders can suspect them. Frozen suits are the reason why, when we estimate base number of tricks, we give declarer's side an extra trick. Leads are often made into frozen suits because they are just a guess.  |pg||

cp|Re|at |^b@2
Boldbida: |cp||at|The defender on lead has an opportunity to make use of two very valuable procedures (treatments) for sending messages to the partner about her holding - a BOSTON treatement and the Hight/Low treatment.^^|pg||
at|
Let's talk about BOS- (Bottom Of Something) - TON (Top Of Nothing) leads first.^^|pg||

at|
Usually a lead of a low spot card suggests that you hold an honor in that suit and would like partner to return  if she wins a trick.^^|pg||
at|
 A lead of a high spot card denies an honor and tells partner not to count on you for anything of value in the suit.^^ ||pg||
cp|Bl|at |^b@2
MM: |cp||at|Is the meaning of the high lead  different if this in in the middle of a hand? I understand that TON lead in the middle of the hand does not necessarily deny an honor but requests a change of suit. (I need to clarify this witn Boldbida)^^ |pg||

Boldbida: |cp||at|After declearer plays @dK on E laed, the danger in W winning with the Ace and playing another @d is that if declearer started with KQx she will score an undeserved trick in the suit. However, E low @d lead suggests that she has an honor in the suit, in which case it is completely safe to win with Ace and return @dJ ^^|pg||

cp|Re|at |^b@2
Boldbida: |cp||at|A second valuable 'treatment' which enables a defender to send a useful message to the partner goes as follows:^^|pg||
at|
- when returning a suit perviously led by the partner (which is often a good idea), lead the fourth best card from the original holding of 4 or more and the highest card if you started from fewer than four. This is ofter referred to as giving a 'reminder count'^^|pg||
at|
- for example you have a holding of @SA 8 5; P leads @s and you win a trick with A. Lead back an @s8 informing your P that you are CURRENTLY leading from an even holding of @s.^^ |pg||
at|
- assume you have a holding of  @SA 8 7 5; P leads @s and you win the trick with an A. Lead back @s5 to indicate that your CURRENT lead is from an odd holding of @s^^| pg||

cp|Bl|at |^b@2
MM: |cp||at|Compare two holdings:  @SA 8 7 5  and @SA 8 7 5 3
 After winning with the @sA, what card should be lead back to the partner? @s5 is the 4th card from the top of the original holding. However, if leading 5 I am my 'reminder count' is correct only in the upper holding. (I need to clarify with Boldbida)^^|pg||
