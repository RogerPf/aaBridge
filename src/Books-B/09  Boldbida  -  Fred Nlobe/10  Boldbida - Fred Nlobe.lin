Back in 2016 I turned a couple of seasons of problems that he set his BIL mentees, into lin files.  You can find them -

^b@2One question I have been asked is -
^c@2Why were there so many lin files (Bridge Movies) being produced in the early years of the BIL and yet there appear to be so few being produced now ?

^bThere are two parts to the answer.
|n^|5|at|
^*b|n<|a|at|Firstly^*n - a lot has been done that does not need to be done again.   No one needs to re-create Fred Gitelman's   
^*g::Learn to Play Bridge 2,Learn to Play Bridge^*n  series.

^*b|n<|a|at|Secondly^*n - People are still making lin files.  But - they tend to be shared directly with the class, normally by email.
Just the other day I was shown a lin file that was created by one of Fred's students.
