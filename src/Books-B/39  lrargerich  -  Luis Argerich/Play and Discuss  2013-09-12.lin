And if there's one thing I'm really proud and wasn't mentioned  is that I'm one of the first teachers that joined the BIL when it started
I'm really happy to be part of the BIL for so long and see what all the hard work has done
So let's get this started before we all start to cry :)

I have a strong hand but a void in pd's suit.
I have to think if there's a solution to this hand
Is there a way to find out if I can make 5@D, 6@D or 7@D with a pickup pd?|pg||nt||lb|*bPlease choose your bid.^^6d|mb|6d|at|lrargerich->Kibitzers: Asking 4NT with a spade void is bad because the spade Ace is useless
That's why you never (almost) bid 4NT with a void
I'll take an average solution and bid 6@D
In some hands I might make 7, in some hand I might go down in 6 but in the most cases I think we can make 6|pg||nt|| 
mb|ppp|pg||sk||at|lrargerich: A quick comment
This is one of those hands that is hard to bid
After 3@D I know we might make 5@D, 6@D or 7@D
Unfortunately there's no way to find out which is the best contract|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: Bidding 4NT doesn't help as I'm not interested in the spade Ace
So I just took the statistical approach of bidding 6@D
Because in some hands we might make 7, in some hands we might go down in 6 but in most cases 6@D should be fine
Bidding 5@D or 7@D would have been a huge gamble towards each extreme|pg||nt||at|Isabelle10:  Could you use the losing trick count to help
lrargerich: 3@D shows some extras, that's right
You wouldn't bid 3@D or 3@C with 11-12
The advice I can give from this hand is that when you see that there's no bidding tool to help you find the best contract  you should bid the contract that you think will make in most scenarios
Don't be optimistic or pessimistic but realistic

mb|ppp|pg||sk||at|lrargerich: North might also try doubling 2@H in 4th seat
With 4 spades and 3 diamonds you can play either 2@S or 3@D
In 3@D I think we might make it|pg||nt||at|Isabelle10:  What about support X
lrargerich: Yes, a support double over 1@H would have worked too
With the 8 card fit in @D we shouldn't let them play 2@H without a fight
wyoming33: How does N know you have 5 @D's|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: North doesn't know but there are some hints
One is that a bid of 1@D over 1@C with 4 cards is actually quite rare
(think about it)
With say 3-3-4-3 you usually bid 1NT if you have 6-10|pg||nt||

This is only wrong if they can't make a game and we go down in 4@S which is surely the case here :)
After 1@C and 2@D they might make 5@C, 5@D or 4@H
|pg||nt||sk|w|mb|ppp|pg||sk||at|lrargerich->Kibitzers: 4@S is down 2, can they make something ?
I think they have a play in 4@H or even 5@D

lrargerich: In case it helps you are not expected to make 4@S pd :)|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: This was a very interesting hand 
After 1@C-1@S-2@D
I think 4@S is clear white vs red because as I said to the kibs either we make 4@S or they make something
4@S is only wrong if we go down in 4@S and they can't make any game
So again, statistically 4@S is a normal bid|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: Now after 4@S is passed back to East
With a 6-5 hand I think you should do something, even if wrong
You might try doubling 4@S
spunkers: Certainly wanted to but I'm a chicken heart
lrargerich: or bidding 5@D
It's not an easy hand but you should feel that passing 4@S is wrong|pg||nt||at|masse24: Should East expect the 4@S jump with a Stiff? 
And.....would that change your initial response to a double...or 2@H?
lrargerich: Good question Masse
Doubling 1@S is not even an option
And between 2@H or 2@D it's a good question because you expect a 4@S bid somewhere|pg||nt||at|And bidding @D first will take the heart suit out of the game
But the diamonds are too good and the hearts too bad to bid 2@H instead of 2@D
So I think I would bid 2@D and I think I would regret it too :)
Say you bid 2@H, and then 5@D over 4@S
Pd then corrects to 5@H with xx and xx - that wouldn't be very nice....|pg||nt||at|
masse24: Then you can blame it on pard for having garbage in the reds! :)
lrargerich: Yes, If I'm going to miss-describe my hand I always want to have a very good reason
and I dont' think we had a good enough reason in that hand

masse24: We both have 1430 on our profiles
lrargerich: Knowing that pd has one ace, then only one key-card is missing and 6@S is normal|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: You shouldn't bid 5@S unless 2 keycards are missing
If you have 3 and pd 1 then you have 4/5 so you bid 6@S
Isabelle10: Would you use blackwood with 2 quick losers (in this case hearts)
lrargerich: Yes I think 4NT is sound even with xx in @H
Because the hand is too strong to expect pd to have nothing in @H|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: pd might have @SKJ, @HQJ, @DKJ @CQJ
But it's one in zillion hands where that happens
And even then they still have to lead a @H :)
After 1@S-4NT I don't think a heart lead is marked :)
I always say that if you bid a slam in that way with AK missing in a side suit you have about 75% chances of making it  because you only go down if the opening leader has AK of that suit|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: With Ax or Kx you normally don't lead that against a slam
And with xx you usually lead something else
That's not very scientific but it works every time :)
One day we'll have to write a book that nobody has written about bridge yet titled 
"wrong things that you know will be right"
because many times you have to do something that is wrong because you know it is right

up|36|pf|y|at|lrargerich: In the play you shouldn't play the diamond jack unsupported
You need the diamond ten to be able to run the jack
The jack without the ten always fails,  either it loses to the queen in east  or west covers and you lose the ten
So in this trump position the percentage play is AK trying to drop the Queen doubleton
and it would have worked in this particular hand|pg||nt||at|MargoD:  So should I not have tried to finesse the Q -   I was thinking 8 ever 9 never

altak38:  I hated my opening lead.  My 2nd choice was a low spade.  It didnt matter but I would have felt better.
lrargerich: Altak: with your hand I think the opening lead is a nightmare
If you lead the heart Ace or you say "Here's the diamond queen"
So it has to be a club or a spade|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: Let's also note something else about the play,  
you can win the club lead,  unblock the spade ace,  go to hand with a diamond,  
and discard both hearts on the spades.

or Diamond Ace and a club but nobody leads Ace from AQJ
So many ifs here|pg||nt||at|Let's say I bid 3@D instead of 3@C will they play 4@h ? 3@S ?
And what would pd lead against 4@S?
I think a club might be a logical lead even without the 3@C bid
So we can conclude 3@C was not necessary here|pg||nt||at|

up|52|pf|y|at|lrargerich: Well done!
Here declarer played a wonderful deceptive play when she played a diamond to the K instead of starting trumps
The diamond makes it look as if declarer needs to ruff diamond losers in dummy
And I bit
If you start trumps I think you go down 
So I think we need a round of applause here|pg||nt||at|

up|21|pf|y|at|Heinz  57: Only lead is the suit that wasn't bid...game over
altak38:  ... and the killing lead is obvious
lrargerich: Not a problem what can you lead... but a spade on this auction ? :)
The suit might be 3-4 it might block who knows...
Miksa: another hand for your book?
lrargerich: That would be another book, a sequel !|pg||nt||at|lrargerich: 4@H was much much better here
The hint was that I couldn't bid 3NT over 3@D
3@H is a strange bid when you already told you had 5 @H's
So it should look as "I can't bid 3NT and my hearts are nice"
altak38:  Yes but i didn't know if your 2NT was minimum or 18-19
lrargerich: I never have 18-19 :)|pg||nt||at|
lrargerich: This will be our last hand I had a really nice time
Fun hands, interesting auctions and play and a lot of unknowns
And Happy Birthday to the BIL|pg||nt||at|
