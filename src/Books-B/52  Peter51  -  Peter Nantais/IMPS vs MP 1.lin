fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2INTRODUCTION  TO  MATCHPONTS

If you and partner are playing in a 28 board matchpoint tourney at your local club, then each board is worth about  3.5% of the total matchpoints available -   ( 100/28 = 3.5 about). It is your task while playing bridge that afternoon to get as many of the matchpoints on each hand as you can. You get these matchpoints by beating as many of your true opponents as you can on each hand. It doesn't matter by how much you beat them; you just have to beat them. 
 WHO ARE YOUR TRUE OPPONENTS?
Your true or real opponents are all of the other pairs who will play the same hands as you do. Let's say that you and your partner are sitting E - W. Your true opponents are all of the other pairs sitting E - W during this tourney. On each hand, the more of these pairs that you beat, the more matchpoints you will receive.
Let's look at the results of a typical hand in a twelve table matchpoint event:|

The N-S pair at table 1 played 3@h making their contract for a score of  +140. 
That score beat all of the other 11 N-S pairs giving them 11 matchpoints. 
Each pair gets 1 matchpoint for every pair that they beat.  
BBO converts the matchpoints to a percentage 
or in this case because they received all of the matchpoints possible  100%.|

N-S pair 4 tied with pair 5 with -140. 
They beat 7 pairs and received another half for tying each other for a total of 7.5. 

The rest of the N-S pairs received fewer MP because they beat fewer pairs. 
The more pairs that you beat, the more matchpoints you get on each hand. 

The E-W scores and MP are given in the right hand columns.

A matchpoint tourney is a little like a street fight!! 
^*bYour partnership is battling against all of the other  pairs who will play your cards^*n. 
The more of those pairs you beat, the more matchpoints you get. 
They are your real opponents not the opps sitting at your table.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |

You are attempting to get a bigger plus or a smaller minus than all of the others who play your cards.
Earlier, I suggested that a matchpoint tourney is a little like a street fight. 
You are playing bridge, that's true. 
However, at matchpoints, it is sometimes necessary to bend the rules a bit to get 
a bigger plus or a smaller minus. 
You might do something at matchpoints that you would never do at imps.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
 
Let's look at an example. 
Let's say that your opps stop bidding at 2 hearts and you are in the pass-out seat. 
If you pass they get the contract for 2@H. 
If they make the contract, you will probably get a very poor result -110. They stopped at the 2 level so the points must be pretty even. 
During the bidding partner overcalled 1@S showing a five card suit. 
You have three spades making an eight card fit. 
The law says that you can bid 2@S expecting to take eight tricks if spades are trump 
no matter how many points you have. 
You are assuming that you and partner have about half the points.
If you make 2@S you get  +110 which is much better than  -110. 
If you go down 1 you get  -50 which is still better than  -110. 
If the opps go to 3 hearts, they might go down 1 which gives you +50.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at| 

This is a very simple example and you might have done the same thing at imps. 
However, it is essential to do this at MP as you battle it out with your true opponents.

Above was the content of the first handout Peter sent us.
What follows next is the first session,
where Peter took all 4 seats in the first 4 example hands. (discussion hands)
We were asked to watch all 4 hands and bid them.

I'll present this in quiz format, where the "correct" answer is the consensus answer.
Bids will be discussed as they go.
These 4 hands were not played.

The second section is the 8 hands bid and played by volunteers (thank you!)
and attention will be given to the defense as well 
These are actual tourney hands and Peter has the results for us.

With the choice of hands (all odd numbered hands are IMP hands, all even numbered hands MP hands)
Peter intends to give us a feel for the differences.
Today will be all about part scores.

Why don't we look at a few examples that might occur in a typical 8 hand match?

      TABLE 1                TABLE 2

N-S PAIR (ZA)        N-S PAIR (XB)
E-W PAIR (XA)       E-W PAIR (ZB)

The N-S pair at table 1 (ZA) are team-mates with the E-W pair at table 2 (ZB).
The E-W pair at table 1 (XA) are team-mates with the N-S pair at table 2 (XB).
Therefore we can say that the 'Z' team ( ZA and ZB)  is competing against the 'X' team (XA and XB).

Hand 1:

Table 1  4@hS (ZA) =  + 420
Table 2  4@hS (XB) =  + 420

Both the X team and the Z team scored +420. Therefore there is no difference and  both the X team and the Z team receive 0 imps on hand 1. This situation is called 'a push'.

Hand 2:

Table 1  4@dS (ZA)  = +130
Table 2  3@sE (ZB)  = +140

Both of the Z pairs received a plus score  +130 and +140 for a total of +270. 
If you look at the Imps table a score of 270 translates into 7 imps. 
Thus the Z pair receive +7 imps, while the X pair receive -7 imps.

Hand 3:

Table 1  5@cN (ZA)  -1  =  -100
Table 2  5@cN (XB)       =  +600

Both of the X teams have received a plus score ( 100 and 600) for a total of 700 or 12 imps on the imps table. 
Therefore the Z team receives -700 and -12 imps.

Hand 4:

Table 1  3@sE (XA) +1   =  +170
Table 2  2@hE (ZB)       =  +110

Both the X team and the Z team have a plus but the X team's plus is higher by 60 ( 170 - 110 = 60). 
This gives the X team +2 imps and the Z team -2 imps.

Hand 5:

Table 1  2@sS (ZA) -1   =  -100
Table 2  2@sS (XB) -1   =  -100

Both the X team and the Z team have -100 which is a push.

Hand 6:

Table 1  4@sE (XA)  +1   =  +650
Table 2  6@sS (ZB)  -1   =  -100

Both the X pairs have pluses+650 at table 1 and +100 at table 2 for a total of +750 or +13 imps on the imps table. 
This of course leaves the Z pair with -13 imps.

Hand 7:

Table 1  3@sS (ZA)         =  +140
Table 2  5@cX N (XB) -2    =  -300

Both of the Z teams have a plus 140 and 300 for a total of +440 or +10 imps. 
Therefore the X team have two minus scores and -10 imps.


Hand 8:

Table 1  3@hX N (ZA)       =  +530
Table 2  2@hN (XB)  +1    =  +140

Team Z scored  +530 at table 1 but  -140 at table 2 for a total of +390 or +9 imps. 
Team X therefore will receive -9 imps.

^*bSUMMARY OF THE 8 HAND MATCH^*n

                    ^fZ team               ^jX TEAM
HAND 1      ^f0 imps                ^j0 imps
HAND 2    ^f+7 imps (+7)      ^j-7 imps (-7)
HAND 3    ^f-12 imps (-5)      ^j+12 imps (+5)
HAND 4     ^f-2 imps (-7)        ^j+2 imps (+7)
HAND 5      ^f0 imps (-7)          ^j0 imps (+7)
HAND 6    ^f-13 imps (-20)     ^j+13 imps (+20)
HAND 7    ^f+10 imps (-10)    ^j-10 imps  (+10)
HAND 8     ^f+9 imps (-1)        ^j-9 imps (+1)

Team X defeats Team Z by 1 imp.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2IMPS vs MP -  SESSION  2  NOTES  - UNCONTESTED GAME CONTRACTS


In our first session, we restricted our discussion mainly to part score hands. 
We examined many strategies that you might consider as you bid and play hands at IMP and MP scoring.  
We certainly emphasized the competitive aspect of bidding part score hands. 
These strategies were contained in the notes that I sent you late last week. |
pg| ***** 270 ***** |


at|

This week, we will be going on to consider game contracts. 
Now, that certainly doesn't mean that you should forget about the strategies that we considered last week. 
In fact, it might be a good idea to read through those materials because these concepts will keep coming up 
over and over again.|
pg| ***** 271 ***** |

One of the most momentous decisions that we all have to make when we play this game has to do with 
going to the game level. 
This is because of the bonus points we get for bidding and making a game contract. 
As you know, for making a game, we receive a 300 point bonus when we are not vulnerable, 
and 500 points when we are. 
Generally, how do we know when we should be going to the game level? 
Certainly the points that you and partner share is a very important criterion when deciding whether or not 
to go to game. |
pg| ***** 272 ***** |


at|
We have always looked to 25 or 26 points as being the magic number when we are trying to decide whether to go for it or not. 
The distribution of your hand should also be taken into consideration. 
If your hand is balanced then you must have all of the points that are required to go to game. 
However, if your hand is unbalanced then sometimes you might be able to make a game with less than the 
full requirement of points. 
As you gain more and more experience in making these decisions, knowing when to go to game becomes less scary

I have always thought that it was very important that the bidding methods that you and partner employ 
will help you arrive at the right level and in the correct denomination. 
In other words, you probably don't want to be in five clubs when you can make nine tricks in no trump. 
You should work continuously with your partner to sharpen your skills in this area.|

^*BClose Decisions in Imps Games^*N

^*BNot Vulnerable^*N
Let's say that you were very close to having the requirements to bid 4 hearts not vulnerable. 
If you bid 3 hearts and make an overtrick that would give you 170. 
If you had bid 4 hearts and made it, you would have gotten 420. 
The difference is 250 which when we consult the Imps table translates into 6 imps. 
So, for not bidding a non-vulnerable game that you could make, you would lose 6 imps.|
pg| ***** 275 ***** |


at|


^*bVulnerable^*n
Let's now say that you have exactly the same decision to make when you are vulnerable. 
Stopping in 3 hearts still gets you 170 if you make 4. 
However, if you bid 4 and make it when you are vulnerable, you would receive 620. 
The difference between 620 and 170 is 450 points which is 10 imps. |
pg| ***** 276 ***** |

Therefore, whenever you have a close decision about game and you are vulnerable, you should bid the game 
and take your chances because many other pairs are probably doing the same thing. 
If you go down, they probably will go down too. 
If you make, so will they. 
You just don't want to be in 3 when all of the rest are making 10 tricks in 4.   
10 imps is a lot to make up.

pg| ***** 277 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
When  you have a close decision and you are NOT vulnerable, if you decide wrong you would lose 6 imps, not 10.
That's significant but not as bad. 
I'm not saying that you should not bid game when you have a close decision and you are not vulnerable. 
That is a tough decision. 
If it makes you feel better, all of the pairs playing your cards have to suffer through the same decision. 
However, in the same situation when you are vulnerable, a lot of pairs go ahead and bid the game 
just because they are vulnerable and would have so much to lose. 
At imps scoring, vulnerable or not, make your contract. It's important!|

^*BClose Decisions in Matchpoint Games^*n

Let's say that you have a very close decision to make about whether or not to go to game in a matchpoint tourney.
Times like this make you insane!! 
This is one of those very difficult decisions that you have to make in the game of bridge.
At matchpoints, it doesn't matter whether you are vulnerable or not. 
A poor decision will give you a bad score either way! 
This is the time when you use every ounce of experience that you have had in this game. 
Perhaps you have some other criterion that you use when you are making decisions like this.|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


at| 

In a situation like this, if I still don't have a clear answer, I ask myself 
"What will most of the people playing these cards do in this situation"?  
And then I do the same thing. 
I'm sorry because I know some of you are saying: "Wow!! What kind of a teacher are you? 
That's no answer to a serious question like this!!"
I agree that it is not a very good answer, but it is the only one that I've got!|
pg| ***** 280 ***** |


at|

If your decision is not close then you should make sure that you are in the game. 
If it is a matchpoint tourney, you should consider playing in no trump because 10 tricks in no trump will get you 10 points more than 10 tricks in a major. Also, consider trying for overtricks at matchpoints.
I have sent some sample hands for you to examine (with results). I hope that these hands will help you get ready for the decisions you will have to make in our session next Sunday.
