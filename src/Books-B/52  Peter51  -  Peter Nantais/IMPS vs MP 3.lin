fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2IMPS vs MP -  SESSION  3  NOTES  - 

Now that we have a couple of sessions 'under our belts,' I think that it is time to talk about imps and MP scoring again. 
If our topic were something that lent itself well to the format that we are using in our sessions, 
this would be a lot easier. 
Now, what exactly do I mean by that??

If I were teaching, let's say, a very specific topic like Jacoby transfers, or takeout doubles 
or Michaels cue-bids it would be much, much easier to do than our present  subject. 
These topics have very definite, specific, situations when they are used and therefore they are relatively 
easy to teach. 
If your partner opens 1 NT and you have 5+ hearts, no matter how many points you have, 
you should bid 2 diamonds inviting partner to bid 2 hearts. 

Our topic on the other hand, is a very complicated, convoluted subject. 
However, many  bridge players find the challenge of matchpoint scoring fascinating.  
Many outstanding players prefer matchpoints.

In previous notes, we have talked about the most important IMP and MP strategies that need to be discussed,
understood and incorporated into our play. 
The problem is that these strategies don't produce the desired results every single time. 
With matchpoints, no matter how good a bridge player you are, you will not do well on every single hand. 
Let me explain...

In my experience, most very strong matchpoint players have a cumulative percentage in the low 60's. 
That is, if you wrote down their score after every weekly game, an average over the year of 60% would be outstanding. 
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
You really shouldn't make a decision about how good a matchpoint player you are only after a single game. 
Your matchpoint strategies are 'long run' strategies.
Even the best players, some days, are going to get poor results. 
This is because in matchpoints games, there are so many changeable, variable influences affecting the outcome, 
that you can get a poor result even after your most skillful efforts at the game.


For example, let's say that you are heading for a very sweet 4 hearts contract vulnerable that looks 'rock solid'. If you make it, you will get +620 and your fair share of the available matchpoints. 
However, the opp in the pass-out seat makes a 4 spade sacrifice bid not vulnerable. 
You double and put him down 3 for +500 and a very poor score. 
Instead of doubling, if you had bid 5 hearts you go down 1 for -100 and an absolute bottom!!

The point that I'm trying to make is that there are so many fickle, capricious, erratic things that can happen 
when you play matchpoints that your skills as a bridge player are not always the determining factor 
as to how well you will do. As soon as that opp bid 4 spades, you were going to get a poor result and there was nothing that you could do about it.
On the other hand, just as many times as you get a bad score, you will get a good score that you didn't deserve because the opps playing at your table made a mistake. 
The opps might make a poor lead giving you an overtrick that no-one else got. 
You get a top board NOT because of anything that you did! That's matchpoints.


These are the most important points that I am trying to make about matchpoints:
You and partner must be the best bridge players that you can be. 
You must be the strongest declarers and defenders that you can possibly be. 
This is a critical part of matchpoints (and imps) play.
Employ the matchpoint and imps strategies that we have been discussing. 
Reflect on the fact that you are playing matchpoints in the long run. 
Ignore poor single results.

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 
If you and partner are getting consistently poor results, then you both must look at what aspects of your game 
need to be improved.
Remember that even the best players get bad results on some of the hands that they play in every single tourney. 


Peter will now go over the 4 hands he sent us to examine
Bidding might be different from the hand-out you got,
this due to BBO setting the dealer when you upload a few hands at the same time.
It's still nice to compare both, movie and scan hands, and notice the different bidding sequences, depending on who's the dealer.

peter51: Today we are talking about competitive hands like two weeks ago
But today we are discussing near game contracts or beyond game

5@d might be doubled and EW are vulnerable|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
Isabelle10:  with singleton @s, yes 5@d
msphola:  They can only go down 1 doubled, no defense

peter51: You have to decide whether or not 4@s makes (and then 5@d-1 even doubled is a good sac)
-200 in stead of -420, a difference of 220, which would save you 6 IMP
(mm: down 2 doulbed vulnerable = - 500, not a good sac)|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|peter51: yes not much defense
Perfect defense by E-W is a Club lead
Then a Club back and South takes the King
then N-S are down 1
However most defenses will lead a Diamond, and then 4@s makes because the declarer can sluff losers on @h
At imps if you think that the opps will make the contract then yes I think bid 5@d|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|peter51: Down 1 even doubled is better than -420 for 4@s making
lynsnow:  With N being a passed hand - would assume contract won't make
tutootsie: Doesn't 4 spades still lose 1@d, 2 @c & 1@h? (If W leads @dA then Club)
peter51: Yes that will be ok

at|peter51: Should E-W go to game?  It's MP, both vulnerable
You probably will be doubled, and you and partner are not that strong
If you bid 4@h, you might tempt North to bid 5@d which might make and give you a bad score.
Then again, you might beat 5@d..
Should you pass and defend 4@d?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|Wawanosh:  They will go 5 @d
peter51: yes if E-W make a questionable bid 4@h - 
The opps may go to game which makes
N-S have a nice play with a cross ruff - 11 tricks (600 vulnerable)
or they may double|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|tutootsie: E bidding LOTT
peter51: And they could go down 3
It would be better to let the opps play 4@d
Isabelle10:  Would you bid this hand differently in IMPS?|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|peter51: No I don't think that I would
I might have let them play 3@d at imps
tutootsie: E/W have 5 losers, down 3 for 300 or 800 if doubled

It is a very difficult slam to bid
greenie08:  Yes for a moment but felt nervous about only 1 Spade
peter51: I guess that you'd just have to go ahead and bid it
You weren't alone in 4@s

I think that there were 9 tricks in hearts and spades
4@h goes down 1 and a bad score

sk||at|kirby2:  Should I have gone for 3 to invite?
peter51: Yes perhaps
(mm: 13 HCP, but 20+ playing pts, 5 losers after partner supports, may even jump to 4)
It was a very close decision, but you could make 10 tricks
There were many that stayed in part score 
Those hands with 4-card support are awkward if you don't have 11 points|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


nt||at|KangaRhu:  Does the LOTT say to bid to the 3 level regardless of HCP if 4 to support?
peter51: It says that you can, you are justified

IMPS vs MP - NOTES FOR THE Fourth SESSION

Here we are in the week before our final session. Karen and I would like to thank you very much for your involvement.
 
I don't think that I want to write any further notes having to do with imps and MP strategies. 
You have already received all that you need to distinguish between the two.
 
In the first three sessions we have examined 
a) competitive part score hands, 
b) non-competitive game contracts and 
c) competitive game contracts (with a few slams).
 
I have prepared 16 hands for this Sunday's session. These hands are a nice mixture of all three weekly topics 
and this week I would like again to alternate IMP and MP hands with one major difference.
 
This week as we finish an IMP hand, I will ask the players to play the hand again at MP scoring and 
we will discuss what differences the scoring method might make in how the hand might be bid and played 
the second time through. 
Also, as we finish a MP hand, I will ask the players to play it again at imps scoring and again we will 
discuss the differences that the scoring method might produce.
 
So, if you would like, you might want to reread the notes or examine Karen's very excellent movies of the notes 
and session hands that I hope that you have all received.
 
I am looking forward to some spirited discussion.

This concludes this presentation, (3 /4)    Karen10|
