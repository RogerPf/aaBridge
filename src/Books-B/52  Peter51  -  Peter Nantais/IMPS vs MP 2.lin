fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2IMPS vs MP -  SESSION  2  NOTES  - UNCONTESTED GAME CONTRACTS


In our first session, we restricted our discussion mainly to part score hands. 
We examined many strategies that you might consider as you bid and play hands at IMP and MP scoring.  
We certainly emphasized the competitive aspect of bidding part score hands. 
These strategies were contained in the notes that I sent you late last week. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|

This week, we will be going on to consider game contracts. 
Now, that certainly doesn't mean that you should forget about the strategies that we considered last week. 
In fact, it might be a good idea to read through those materials because these concepts will keep coming up 
over and over again.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|

One of the most momentous decisions that we all have to make when we play this game has to do with 
going to the game level. 
This is because of the bonus points we get for bidding and making a game contract. 
As you know, for making a game, we receive a 300 point bonus when we are not vulnerable, 
and 500 points when we are. 
Generally, how do we know when we should be going to the game level? 
Certainly the points that you and partner share is a very important criterion when deciding whether or not 
to go to game. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
We have always looked to 25 or 26 points as being the magic number when we are trying to decide whether 
to go for it or not. 
The distribution of your hand should also be taken into consideration. 
If your hand is balanced then you must have all of the points that are required to go to game. 
However, if your hand is unbalanced then sometimes you might be able to make a game with less than the 
full requirement of points. 
As you gain more and more experience in making these decisions, knowing when to go to game becomes less scary.
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

I have always thought that it was very important that the bidding methods that you and partner employ 
will help you arrive at the right level and in the correct denomination. 
In other words, you probably don't want to be in five clubs when you can make nine tricks in no trump. 
You should work continuously with your partner to sharpen your skills in this area.|

^*BClose Decisions in Imps Games^*N

^*BNot Vulnerable^*N
Let's say that you were very close to having the requirements to bid 4 hearts not vulnerable. 
If you bid 3 hearts and make an overtrick that would give you 170. 
If you had bid 4 hearts and made it, you would have gotten 420. 
The difference is 250 which when we consult the Imps table translates into 6 imps. 
So, for not bidding a non-vulnerable game that you could make, you would lose 6 imps.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|


^*bVulnerable^*n
Let's now say that you have exactly the same decision to make when you are vulnerable. 
Stopping in 3 hearts still gets you 170 if you make 4. 
However, if you bid 4 and make it when you are vulnerable, you would receive 620. 
The difference between 620 and 170 is 450 points which is 10 imps. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

Therefore, whenever you have a close decision about game and you are vulnerable, you should bid the game 
and take your chances because many other pairs are probably doing the same thing. 
If you go down, they probably will go down too. 
If you make, so will they. 
You just don't want to be in 3 when all of the rest are making 10 tricks in 4.   
10 imps is a lot to make up.
|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
When  you have a close decision and you are NOT vulnerable, if you decide wrong you would lose 6 imps, not 10.
That's significant but not as bad. 
I'm not saying that you should not bid game when you have a close decision and you are not vulnerable. 
That is a tough decision. 
If it makes you feel better, all of the pairs playing your cards have to suffer through the same decision. 
However, in the same situation when you are vulnerable, a lot of pairs go ahead and bid the game 
just because they are vulnerable and would have so much to lose. 
At imps scoring, vulnerable or not, make your contract. It's important!|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |

^*BClose Decisions in Matchpoint Games^*n

Let's say that you have a very close decision to make about whether or not to go to game in a matchpoint tourney.
Times like this make you insane!! 
This is one of those very difficult decisions that you have to make in the game of bridge.
At matchpoints, it doesn't matter whether you are vulnerable or not. 
A poor decision will give you a bad score either way! 
This is the time when you use every ounce of experience that you have had in this game. 
Perhaps you have some other criterion that you use when you are making decisions like this.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at| 

In a situation like this, if I still don't have a clear answer, I ask myself 
"What will most of the people playing these cards do in this situation"?  
And then I do the same thing. 
I'm sorry because I know some of you are saying: "Wow!! What kind of a teacher are you? 
That's no answer to a serious question like this!!"
I agree that it is not a very good answer, but it is the only one that I've got!|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

If your decision is not close then you should make sure that you are in the game. 
If it is a matchpoint tourney, you should consider playing in no trump because 10 tricks in no trump will get you 10 points more than 10 tricks in a major. Also, consider trying for overtricks at matchpoints.
I have sent some sample hands for you to examine (with results). I hope that these hands will help you get ready for the decisions you will have to make in our session next Sunday.

peter51: MOST OF OUR HANDS TODAY ARE AT OR NEAR THE GAME LEVEL
AGAIN WE WILL ALTERNATE IMP AND MP HANDS
LET'S REVIEW A LITTLE ABOUT GAME CONTRACTS GENERALLY:

THE ACCUMULATED POINTS THAT YOU AND PARTNER HOLD IS A VERY IMPORTANT GAUGE OR MEASURE 
ON YOUR WAY TO A GAME
THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR HAND IS ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR
IF YOU HAVE A BALANCED HAND, THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ALL OF THE POINTS NEEDED FOR GAME
IF YOU HAVE AN UNBALANCED HAND, THEN YOU MIGHT NOT NEED THE FULL 25 OR 26 POINTS
IF YOU HAVE VERY UNUSUAL DISTRIBUTION (FREAKY!) YOU MIGHT CONSIDER GOING TO GAME WITH EVEN FEWER POINTS
THIS APPLIES TO BOTH IMPS AND MP

ABOUT MP
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BID A CLOSE GAME AT MATCHPOINTS
IMP PLAYERS OFTEN BID CLOSE GAMES ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE YOUR CONTRACT AT IMP|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |

mamadee:  Reason Peter?
triciacam: I don't get the scoring if I bid 3@H and another table bids 4@h and we both make 5  why do they get more MP ?  Is it because they bid game and I didn't?
peter51: YES Tricia
triciacam: ok so why do you say that it isn't as important to bid game in MP's?|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

We were talking about bidding close games at MP scoring.  
In the long run it doesn't matter as much at MP scoring to go to game in a close decision situation.  
Bidding three and making five gets you 150. 
This would be just below 450 which you would get for being in game and making an overtrick. 
I was trying to say that at imps the 300 between 150 and 450 would cost you eight imps. 
But at MP 150 would be just below 450 and you would lose some MP but not a lot 
because in a close decision, a lot of people would not go to game. 
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

All of this is contingent upon your not being sure whether or not there is a game. 
If you are pretty sure there is a game and that everyone will be in game, 
then you must also be in game. 
If it is a close decision however, and you are not sure if you should go to game or not, 
then in MP it doesn't matter as much if you don't bid the game and some other pairs bid it and make it.

South is certainly a little too strong for this 2@d bid, 
After partner bids 1@h even the @hK singleton is not that bad anymore
South should go on an adventure trip|

IMPS vs MP - NOTES FOR THE THIRD SESSION

Now that we have a couple of sessions 'under our belts,' I think that it is time to talk about imps and MP scoring again. 
If our topic were something that lent itself well to the format that we are using in our sessions, 
this would be a lot easier. 
Now, what exactly do I mean by that??

If I were teaching, let's say, a very specific topic like Jacoby transfers, or takeout doubles 
or Michaels cue-bids it would be much, much easier to do than our present  subject. 
These topics have very definite, specific, situations when they are used and therefore they are relatively 
easy to teach. 
If your partner opens 1 NT and you have 5+ hearts, no matter how many points you have, 
you should bid 2 diamonds inviting partner to bid 2 hearts. 

Our topic on the other hand, is a very complicated, convoluted subject. 
However, many  bridge players find the challenge of matchpoint scoring fascinating.  
Many outstanding players prefer matchpoints.

In previous notes, we have talked about the most important IMP and MP strategies that need to be discussed,
understood and incorporated into our play. 
The problem is that these strategies don't produce the desired results every single time. 
With matchpoints, no matter how good a bridge player you are, you will not do well on every single hand. 
Let me explain...

In my experience, most very strong matchpoint players have a cumulative percentage in the low 60's. 
That is, if you wrote down their score after every weekly game, an average over the year of 60% would be outstanding. 
You really shouldn't make a decision about how good a matchpoint player you are only after a single game. 
Your matchpoint strategies are 'long run' strategies.
Even the best players, some days, are going to get poor results. 
This is because in matchpoints games, there are so many changeable, variable influences affecting the outcome, 
that you can get a poor result even after your most skillful efforts at the game.
|
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

For example, let's say that you are heading for a very sweet 4 hearts contract vulnerable that looks 'rock solid'. If you make it, you will get +620 and your fair share of the available matchpoints. 
However, the opp in the pass-out seat makes a 4 spade sacrifice bid not vulnerable. 
You double and put him down 3 for +500 and a very poor score. 
Instead of doubling, if you had bid 5 hearts you go down 1 for -100 and an absolute bottom!!

The point that I'm trying to make is that there are so many fickle, capricious, erratic things that can happen 
when you play matchpoints that your skills as a bridge player are not always the determining factor 
as to how well you will do. As soon as that opp bid 4 spades, you were going to get a poor result and there was nothing that you could do about it.
On the other hand, just as many times as you get a bad score, you will get a good score that you didn't deserve because the opps playing at your table made a mistake. 
The opps might make a poor lead giving you an overtrick that no-one else got. 
You get a top board NOT because of anything that you did! That's matchpoints.


These are the most important points that I am trying to make about matchpoints:
You and partner must be the best bridge players that you can be. 
You must be the strongest declarers and defenders that you can possibly be. 
This is a critical part of matchpoints (and imps) play.
Employ the matchpoint and imps strategies that we have been discussing. 
Reflect on the fact that you are playing matchpoints in the long run. 
Ignore poor single results. 
If you and partner are getting consistently poor results, then you both must look at what aspects of your game 
need to be improved.
Remember that even the best players get bad results on some of the hands that they play in every single tourney. Here are the results that two partnerships recently got in a BBO matchpoint tourney. 
Pair A are bridge players who in the long run have 61%. 
Pair B are bridge players who in the long run have about 47%....(?)
