nt|Ind. BIL  Birthday with ^*bFRED^*n

At my table on the first board I think the auction that happened was likely duplicated at many tables...
I opened 1@S and everyone passed - not very exciting! the lie of the cards was very friendly and i think declarer can always take 10 tricks no matter what the defense does not much of a lesson in that hand unfortunately - hopefully we will have some more excitement in the hands to come...|pg||

nt|Well board 2 was a little more interesting at least... Once again I got to open 1@S (I was East) the next hand had an interesting decision to make: DBL, Pass, and 2@C are all possible if that hand had 4 hearts and 3 diamonds instead of the other way around then i think most would agree that DBL would be a standout but we are taught that you should have 4 in the other major in order to make a takeout dbl when the opening bid is 1 of a major, how seriously should we take such advice? my advice would be "not very seriously" I would say that if the hand is marginal in terms of high-card values for a takeout dbl (as the actual hand was)...  |pg||
nt|Then lacking 4 of the other major is a negative factor that might push the decision toward Passing but if you have sound takeout DBL values, then don't worry about lacking 4 of the other major - in my experience DBLing is the winning action on such hands if you have a regular partner this is a good thing to discuss to make sure you are on the same page this is really just a matter of style and opinion - you have just heard my opinion - not everyone would agree (not even close!)
Anyways, i ended up in 4@S which i expect was the contract at most tablesonce again the layout was friendly and in practice i expect that almost everyone made 10 tricks perhaps some people opened 2@S instead of 1@S... I would sometimes open a weak-2 with 11 HCP but that particular hand was too good for me - the void and the Aces and the good spades were more than enough to convince me to open 1@S|pg||

nt|My partner (Jimcloth) used excellent judgment on the last board to get our partnership a really good result... I was the opening bidder (again) - 1@H this time in 3rd position... After a 1@S overcall, Jim invited with 3@H which was passed around to my LHO who very reasonably bid 3@S now but Jim knew what to do - he DBLed them, based on the strength of his KJx of trump we didn't get every possible trick, but down 2 for 500 was still really good for us, especially considering that 4@H is almost certain to fail.|pg||
nt|I suppose the lesson in that hand, just like the first board, is that sometimes good bidding does not end up getting you a good result in this game we made 3NT+1 sometimes you do everything reasonably and it just turns out you get a bad board - best to be philosophical about it and move on. there is nothing you can do about your previous ... results but... if you let bad previous results impact your thinking on future boards, it can only be bad for your score :) use whatever concentration you have for THIS board. When this board is over, it is over - then the next board becomes THIS board.|pg||

nt|That was an instructive hand in my view. My partner (Noslice) and I bid to 3NT, but we had "only" 24 combined HCP. In theory that is not enough, but I think I can make a good case ... for our contract (besides the fact that my partner made it that is!).
For the 4th hand in a row, I was the opening bidder (1@C) this time. My partner responded 1@D, I bid 1@H, and he invited with 2NT. Partner was a passed hand and I had "only" 13 HCP ... and no long suit, but I still bid 3NT - can you see why?
One reason is that there are good 13 point hands and bad 13 point hands. I knew I had a good one because of my fitting diamond honors and 2 Aces, knowing when you have a "good 13" vs a "bad 13" is not an easy thing to describe, because it depends on the context of the auction the more you play bridge the better you get at such decisions - that is what we call "judgment".|pg||

nt|I have been playing bridge for 20+ years and i have studied the game very seriously in that time having seen hands just like this one many times before, i have subconsiously developed a sense of when my hand is better than its point count suggests if that sounds mystical or too difficult for you, i can assure you it is not - it is purely a function of experience the more you play the better you get at such things. My judgment here said "bid 3NT" so that is what I did. it turned out 3NT was far from certain, but it happened to make this time. Here is another reason to stretch to bid 3NT in the actual situation: you are vulnerable and playing IMP scoring at this form of the game, you have more to gain than you have to lose when you bid a close 3NT.|pg||

nt|If you make it you will win 10 IMPs or so, but if you go down you rate to only lose about 5 IMPs, knowing how the scoring works will sometimes help you to decide when to be agressive and when not to be. I am sure some players rebid only 1NT (and not 2NT) with my partner's hand. That is not unreasonable, but again the vulnerability and form of scoring argue for more agressive action the exact # of IMPs you win or lose is largely a function of what everyone else does - my numbers 10 and 5 above approximate what would happen if everyone else bids to a partscore and you bid game|pg||

nt|On the last hand we were about to play quietly in 4@H, when my opponents decided to bid on to the 5-level... my partner bid 5@H and i got a little lucky and made that contract :) again i was the opening bidder and again the next hand had something close to a takeout DBL of 1@H, but the hand was lacking 4 cards in the other major on this particular hand, the vulnerability favors an agressive DBL, but the actual hand is so featureless that I would prefer to Pass but again that is really a matter of judgment and partnership agreement - you and your partner should have a discussion about what an acceptable minimum takeout DBL is the vulnerability and whether or not pard is a passed hand are factors to consider, so is the suit the opp's opened, you need more to DBL 1@S than you need to DBL 1@C because the DBL of 1@C leaves open the possibility of playing a suit at the 1-level.|pg||
nt|Another instructive point about this hand has to do with what my partner held - 5-card support for my hearts but not much in the way of high cards or distribution he had a perfect hand for a "preemptive jump raise", but not enough in my view to jump all the way to 4@H, 4@H is also a preemptive bid, but i would prefer to have some more shape (the same hand with a signleton for example) for that call the opps led a high club, but then shifted to a spade away from the @SK i was not out of the woods yet as i still had 2 club losers... i won't go into the details - it is true that even 4@H will fail on best defense|pg||

nt|Perhaps remarkably, for the 6th hand in a row I opened the bidding. This time 1@H. Whether or not to open my 11 HCP hand is a tough one. I will not claim there is any right or wrong answer to this question. Really whether or not to open 11 HCP hands and which 11 HCP hands to open is a matter for each partnership to decide I personally considered this a very close decision - the fact that my suit was so strong turned out to be the deciding factor for me after i opened, maybe my LHO had been listened to all my previous talk about takeout DBLs with only 3 of the other major nedsr made a takeout DBL with his nice 14 HCP hand - a good bid in my view having opened we were a little lucky (again) to be able to stay out of game, but i won't claim it was a matter of any brilliance by me or my partner :).|pg||
nt|The fact of the matter is that we had a bidding misunderstanding - something that should come as no surprise in an Individual tournament we played in 2@S and were allowed to win 11 tricks - this turned out to be an exactly average result sorry that there are so many things in bidding that fall into the category of judgment/opinion as opposed to right/wrong that's just the way it is in this game - better get used to it :) right the defense was not perfect, but it was not so easy for them to know how to cash their 4 top tricks.|pg||

nt|That was a strange hand. The HCP are fairly evening distributed between the 2 sides and both sides have a nice fit (EW in spades, NS is clubs). But nobody makes much of anything! 2@S is the very most that EW can make and you would have to play it well to make even that meanwhile NS can make no more than 2@C on best defense it is one of those hands that whoever gets a plus score should be happy with themselves - especially if you did so by bidding and making any contract :) sticking with our theme of marginal takeout dbls... Yet another one was dealt on the last hand this time my opp cabob chose to make a takeout dbl of my partner's 1@C opening with a balanced hand with 11 HCP as you might have guessed by now, i like it!|pg||
nt|He had 4-4 in the majors, and the fact that the opening was 1@C gave his partnership flexiblity to play at the 1-level in any suit subsequently both opponents judged well in the bidding to let us play in 3@C... as is often the case in individuals especially, the defense was less than perfect and we were allowed to make that contract defense, like bidding, is a lot easier when you play with a regular partner - you can then make agreements about when you signal and what your signals mean playing a 1-board round with a stranger can be very hard :) so far today i have been very lucky in that my partners have been perfect and my opps have been less than perfect but there are a lot more days that are not like today :)|pg||

nt|Once again on the last board, agressive bidding and careful play would be rewarded - 4@S is not a very good contract just looking at the NS hands, but in practice it can be made despite the 4-0 trump break. My opponents reasonably stopped in 3@S but they will probably lose IMPs for their good jugment - bridge is not always fair :)|pg||
nt|Looks like i scored well - thanks to all my partners for playing so well with me! In any tournament it is always nice to score well, but as beginners and intermediates, please do not get too concerned if your results are not what you were hoping for (especially in short tournaments and especially in individual tournaments) at this point in your bridge careers you should be focusing your attention on learning there will be time for winning later but in the long run you will be better off if you don't lose any sleep over poor results at this point of your development as players, try to learn from your mistakes - that is the most important thing thanks again to maureen for hosting this event and congrats to all of you for BIL's 4th Birthday!|pg||
