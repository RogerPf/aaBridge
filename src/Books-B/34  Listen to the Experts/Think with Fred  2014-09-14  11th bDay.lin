All boards were random. The link to tournament result is:
|CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/myhands/hands.php?tourney=6521-1410725089-^*N|CP||AT|

After the tournament, Fred Gitelman |CP|6|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Gitelman^*N|CP||AT| of Bridge Base Inc. |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/^*N|CP||AT| held an audio review in the BILies Retreat Public clubs. He discussed the bidding, optimal contract, and the different approaches to playing each board.

I really burnt the midnight oil to get this presentation ready for her birthday on September 17. I spent many hours transcribing Fred's audio comments to make this masterpiece.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You can bid the 3@H - HSGT - with the same distribution but (with 10 to 11 points). With a hand that you are not sure that you belong to game or not.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now I knew that my partner would have raised my heart without 4-card support.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|As North, I lead @CK here. There are those who believe that you should lead a trump against grand slam. However, I would be very happy to lead from King-Queen-Jack.|pc|cK|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||sk|w|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now if trumps were divided 3-2 this would be a really easy hand to play. You draw three rounds of trump and eventually discard @C on the fifth spade and ruff your club in the dummy and @dA and @DK would take care of your 2 loosing diamonds.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, at least it seems sensible to start by drawing trumps after winning the opening lead in hand. Because you can actually claim if the trumps break. So let us draw couple rounds of trumps.|

pg| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|d3|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now you can see that drawing the rest of trumps are not going to work. Because if you do that then you can count only on 12 tricks. We can count our trick 5 spades, 4 hearts, the @DA @DK and @CA which is 12. But we need 13 tricks.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The only way to get that, get 13 tricks, is through the trump suit - you will not get the extra trick if you draw another round of trumps.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately there is an easy answer. Instead of ruffing a club in the dummy I can ruff a diamond in the declarer's hand. Watch how is it done.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It is probable that some of you sitting South may overcall 2@C with my hand. South has enough points to do so. But on this particular hand I decided to pass. When I am vulnerable I would like to have better suit for an overcall at the 2 level.

PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|This is a matter of style. I am sure there are very good players who might overcall with my hand. But I am relatively conservative in this situation. At one level I would have bid.|

NT||lb|*bPlease bid for West.^^1n|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West had a hand close enough enough to bid 2@D. In SAYC you only need ten points to do that.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|At our table West bid 1N which is a reasonable option as well. I prefer the 1N because you would have problem for rebid if you had bid 2@D if your partner happened to rebid spades.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West probably could pass the 2@S which I am not sure you can do that. Other bids could be either an overbid, an underbid or the distortion of West's hand. In summary 1N has a lot going for it.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The message of the 2N in this bidding cycle is that West has a maximum hand for the bid and you have both of the minors stopped.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|If west did not have the maximum, he could pass the 2@H or bid 2@S. It is not usual to see 1N followed by 2N. However, West had the perfect hand for the bid.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|North had a tough choice for opening lead. Normally in NT you like to lead from your longest suit. But East already bid both long suits held by North - spades and hearts. It is a good policy in NT not to lead from the suits that opponents explicitly bid.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|So it leaves the minors. North was smart to choose his better minor - clubs. North led @C9. The lead from J98 is mainly based on prior agreement. Regardless the @C9 is a reasonable lead if you are going to choose that suit.|

pc|C9|pc|C3|NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Of course I was very happy that my partner lead a card in my 5-card suit.

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||sk||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, it was difficult for me to play the correct card. Eventually I decided to tell my partner that I liked clubs and played @C5 - an encouraging signal - instead of playing my @CQ.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|However, Declarer has shown strength in minors and now is playing the @D. Therefore, it appeared to me that Declarer has strong @D holding. Therefore, I thought it would be smart for me to hold on the my @DA.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|With this hand it seems your only chance of getting an overtrick is the in heart suit. Something good can happen. The @HJ can be doubleton or the hearts could be 3-3.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The North hand has a lot going for him. Again this is a matter of style. There are places in the bridge world that everyone opens this hand. And there are places that no one opens this hand. I have no particular objection to either opening or not opening this hand. Your partnership should make such decisions.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Let me show you how I think the North/South bidding should go.|sk|s|mb|1N|NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|South has the points for opening the hand 1N. But South has 2 doubletons. 1@D is a great bid too. And you do not expect any rebid problem whatever partners response would be. At my table I opened the hand 1N but later I will show you the hand opening would be 1@D.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I opened the hand 1N, again I was playing with an unknown partner and I feel opening this hand 1N makes the bidding simpler. As it turns out we will get to the same contract opneing 1N or 1@D. Let us proceed with 1N for now.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It is a good question whether South should bid 1@S or 2@S. South has good values and can bid 1@S even with a King less. So 2@S is the proper bid for South.|mb|2S|

pg| ***** 170 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West has Two-Suited hand. Five hearts and five clubs. 2N, the unusual 2N, is a good bid for West. If the RHO bids a major then 2N ,the unusual no trump, shows 5-5 in the minors with enough points to compete in the 3-level.|mb|2N|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly if the RHO opens a minor you still can bid 2N as an unusual no trump. Here the 2N shows hearts and the other minor.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|There is an easy way to remember. The 2NT always promises the two lower ranking unbid suits. Here the two lower ranking unbid suits are hearts and clubs.|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|But I am not done YET. Let us undo the West bid and I will show you a trick which you may or may not have heard of though you may know the unusual 2NT.|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


UB|1|NT||mb|1N|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Please note that West is already passed. So West can bid 1N which is the unusual 1N. If not passed hand, With 15-17 HCP and diamonds stopped West could bid 1NT. But now West cannot have 15-17 HCP - he is a passed hand. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Once West passed his 1NT basically says the same thing as the unusual 2NT with less value. So West can bid unusual 1N if he does not feel brave enough to bid 2NT.|

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Either way such bids by West can make life very difficult for unestablished partnership.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Probably you heard the concept that in competitive auctions a jump, 3@H here, is pre-emptive. If not try to learn it from your bridge teacher or your bridge mentor.|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that North's hand is a bit too good to bid a pre-emptive jump and it is not really that suitable to bid 4@H. For 4@H the hand needs a bit more distribution than that.|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|2@H does not seem right either with 5 trumps. If you give this hand to a panel of experts you will see many different bids that they would prefer. My guess is that most of them will choose the 4@H bid.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now we come to East. He does not have many high cards or a great deal of distribution. But there are many reasons that East should consider bidding 4@S. |
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The reasons being, a) East/West can make 4@S, b) it may be a good sacrifice when North/South make 4@H, or c) it could push North/South to 5@H and they go down.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|South has an interesting choice of lead. You cannot criticize South if he leads @HA. Partner bid to the 4 level in hearts.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that South led from @CQ97 which is very unusual. Most likely declarer should think that he has a loser in clubs regardless - probably @cQ.|

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|In suit contract, declarer should count his losers. Unfortunately there are a few of them here. In order to be able to make the contract he should hope for no ruffs. |

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|That means the trumps need to be 2-2. But still there is a heart loser, almost certainly a club loser because the North most likely has the @CQ, and it looks that there are 2 diamond losers too. |
PG| ***** 230 ***** |

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately, by leading a heart to the dummy the declarer can set up a discard for one of the diamond loser. Declarer should keep his losers to one @D, one @C and one @H.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West in third seat can loosen up the requirements for opening a hand. When you are in the third seat, it is okay to open a hand with a point or so less than you normally open. |

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Again if that is a mysterious concept to you talk to your bridge teacher or bridge mentor about it.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|In short, in American Standard this is a good hand to open in the third seat particularly when the hand has some good cards in the spade suit. |
PG| ***** 281 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|There is another concept that if you are close to an opening bid and you have length in spades you should normally be more aggressive. |

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|My partner with no 4-card major bid 2@D. At our table, I did something a bit unusual and choose to pass the 2@D Stayman response by my partner. My thinking here was that my partner probably has 3 hearts at the most and I was worried that the opponents may lead hearts against NT and most likely they have 8 hearts between the two of them.|
PG| ***** 290 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|I was also worried that my partner's hand is such that my diamond suit might be blocked if for example my partner had @DKQ doubleton where partner cannot overtake the diamond without setting a trick for the opponents. |
PG| ***** 291 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Or partner could have @DQJ9. Partner leads @DQ for a finesse, it gets covered, and he wins with the @DA and could not back to the dummy anymore.|
PG| ***** 292 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You may have heard of a convention called ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n. In the ancient times, if you had 4-4-6-1 and your partner opened 1N, your RHO passed you bid 2@C Stayman even if you had only ^*Bone point^*n intending to pass whatever partner bid. That is the original concept and many still use it. Nowadays there are variations of that.|
PG| ***** 293 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|In one variation if you have a very weak hand with 5-5 in majors facing a 1N opener you can bid 2@C ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n. You would gladly pass any major partner bids. |
PG| ***** 294 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|However, if he bids 2@D you bid 2@H telling partner you have a weak hand with both majors and pick whichever you like. He will pass with longer heart suit or bids 2@S if his spade suit is longer. |
PG| ***** 295 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Nowadays that is what most play and call it ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n. But here as you see my hand is not an example of ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n in its classic sense.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|East has a pretty nice hand opposite of 1@S overcall. Good 4-card support, 13 HCP and pretty good distribution. However, my partner is in tough spots because he does not know what to expect from West - ^*Ban unknown partner^*N.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|My partner made a call which I think is a pretty good bid. He choose to cuebid 2@D. Bidding the opponents suit means, Partner I have a good hand. Tell me what you have."|
PG| ***** 336 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|East conceivably could jumped to 4@S but he was smart and thought to give Fred, his partner, a chance to get out of trouble if he indeed made a bad vulnerable overcall.|
PG| ***** 337 ***** |


sk|s|NT||lb|*mWhich bid or bids by South is reasonable?^3D~Double~4D~Either 3D or Double~I have no clue^4|mb|3d|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|South has  a great hand three aces, 6-card great diamond suit, a king and a singleton. So a double by South shows a good hand and good diamond suit. But South choose to bid 3@D which is acceptable.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|By now East should have all the information he needed and should stay out of game. He no longer has 13 HCP. His @DQ is really worthless - it was not such a great card to begin with. The other thing West had a chance to bid 3@S, with a good hand, and he choose not to do so.|
PG| ***** 341 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, the warning signs are out and East even with great hand opposite a vulnerable overcall should have been content for a 3@S partscore. But my partner bid 4@S. And we play it that way now.|

mb|p|NT||lb|*mWould you open sitting South?^I do~I don't~I may or I may not~You are asking too many questions MM^3|mb|p|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||HC|sahqckcd|at|North has one of those 11 point hand that some people open and some don't. It is a flat 4-3-3-3 and my partner decided not to open.|
PG| ***** 364 ***** |


LC|sahqckcd|mb|p|sk|s|NT||lb|*bPlease bid for South. Not an easy answer.^^1h|hc|hak965|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Conceivably I could open 1N. I have no problem opening 1N with 5-card major. So I judged that another reasonable action would be to open 1@H and rebid 2N. My 2N rebid would be a slight overbid as you need 18-19 point for a 2N rebid. |
PG| ***** 366 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|However, the advantage of bidding 1@H would be to get your 5-card major into the game right away. Further, it is likely that you may not be able to introduce your heart suit later if you open such hands 1N. |
PG| ***** 367 ***** |


lc|hak965|NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You probably recall that I used some judgement on another similar hand and opened 1N while it was not exactly a classic distribution. So again we have the ^*Bstyle and judgement^*N issue here.|mb|1H|
pg| ***** 368 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||lb|*bPlease bid for North.^^1s|mb|1S|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|North has difficult hand to bid. The hand is too strong for a 2@H raise. Further, you do not want to jump to 3@H with only 3-card support with such a balanced hand. This is really a perfect hand for Drury convention.|
PG| ***** 370 ***** |

PG| ***** 371 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Of course we did not discuss such convention with each other beforehand. It could be not part of SAYC - I could be wrong. But, my partner did a battlefield decision. He bid a temporizing 1@S waiting to see how the auction would develop. Probably his plan was to jump in hearts the next time.|
PG| ***** 372 ***** |


mb|p|sk|s|mb|2N|NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 2N as I already planned to. I could conceivably have rebid 2@C instead. That would not be a terrible bid. But in my judgement the 2N described my hand better. |
PG| ***** 373 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|I had great strength in one of my doubletons and my partner covered the other. So there was no question that my hand was a NT hand.|
PG| ***** 374 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Evidently, my partner thought his hand is a NT as well. He bid 3N despite knowing that we had an eight-card trump fit.|mb|3N|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NWay to go karrollie. All the BILies are proud of you.|
PG| ***** 377 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You do not see it that often when a relatively new player recognizing that there are times that in spite of 5-3 trump fit you are better off playing in NT as supposed to a suit contract.|
pg| ***** 378 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|North hand has many signs pointing to NT. A balanced distribution, excellent spot cards, and you know you have many points between the hands. North has 11 points and I promised 18-19 points for 29-30 points. |
PG| ***** 379 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You can easily make 3N with the two hands while with other hands 4@H conceivably could go down if the defense got a ruff or trumps broke badly. Bad things can happen in suit contract which cannot happen in NT contract.|
PG| ***** 380 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|And here you can see that playing in 4@H, if West is divine enough to lead a club. The defense can get @CA, @CQ, and a club ruff. That is the first three tricks. It happens that here the declarer can take the rest and make the contract. However, if the hands were slightly different 4@H would go down while 3N is in no danger at all.|
PG| ***** 381 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|So let us give my partner a big round of applause for making what I think was an insightful and advanced 3N bid which was the wining contract. Let us see how the play went.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Another type of hand to consider is when your partner opens 1N if you have a 4-card major and three of everything else, in my judgement you should not bid Stayman. Just bid however many NTs that your hand is worth. I am sure there are many who disagree. |

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
qx|BLUNT,|AT|
^*BMM:^*N Big Mouth that I am I have a few blunt words for those who are getting this great teaching material. But first let me share with you what one of the BILies wrote to me.

"|CP|6|at|The membership has absolutely no idea what the costs associated with the BIL are, i.e., who gets paid? what they are paid? and is it any of their business?  Actually no. What we, the membership, should be aware of, however, is that there are costs.  
When I joined, I paid a nominal fee for a "life-time" membership.  To be honest, I had no idea what I was buying  -  totally unaware of the fantastic classes (which would cost a bloody fortune to take live), the expert teachers, the wide variety of approaches, and the ability to play 24 hours a day (at no cost) - live bridge cost any where from $5 to $8 a game depending on where you're playing or $11 plus  a session at Sectionals, Regionals, and the Nationals.  I know I've reaped 50 times, in not more, than my initial outlay to join.  Consequently, I make a small yearly donation, not much - just $50 to try and help just a little.  I think this is the point that needs emphasis.  The membership is receiving so much for such a pittance.|CP||AT|"

^*BMM^*N: Yes, no one who works for BIL gets paid.  Maureen (full time), Teachers, Mentors, Movie Makers, BILAssists, BBP, SET, BILFriends, BILHosts, TDs and more. Think about how many hours of lessons, guest visits, practice sessions you attend in the BILies Retreat, how many hours at Courses held in the LearnBrdge Classroom, how many hours of mentoring have you received, how many BIL tournaments have you played in, all the resources available in the BIL Library and much more.

Now let me tell you what is the estimated cost to make this masterpiece at a bargain price. I transcribed more than 140 minutes of audio. At a bargain price of $1.29 min by online vender that = $180. |CP|6|AT|^*Htranscriptdivas.com/transcription-rate^*N|CP||AT|.

I spent 40 hours minimum doing this presentation. In La Jolla even the illegal immigrants make $15 per hour to do odd jobs and gardening. So I am worth $600 though my hourly rate used to be 40 times that much - but I could not get 40 hours a week though -:). I am sure you cannot afford my hourly rate! My lady proof reader probably spent 10 hours and we should pay her the equal rate. 

So the conservative cost for this presentation is $180 + $600 + $150 = $930.00. That does not factor in the time a World Champion bridge player gave and the hours that Maureen and her helpers spent to arrange the event.

Now then don't you think you ^*Bshould^*N make a donation to the Beginner Intermediate Lounge of even a fraction of the cost of making this masterpiece?   You can contribute at   |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com/BILShop/BILShop.php.^*N|CP||at|

BTW, Maureen censored my reprisal if you do not make the donation - yep all them Royal elephants coming your way -:).|
