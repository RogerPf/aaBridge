at|^b@4@2On Sunday, September 9, 2007, ^*bInquiry^*n and ^*bMishoVnBg^*n played in the Beginner Intermediate @3 Lounge (BIL) some random  dealt hands. They were sharing their thoughts with kibitzers as they bid and played and answered questions afterwards. 

Ben and Mihail played BBO Advanced which is basically a 2-over-1 game force system, but they prefer to use Meckwell instead of Cappelletti over their opponents 1NT opening bids. 

^*bBILManager:^*n "A warm WELCOME ^*bInquiry^*n (Ben) and ^*bMishoVnBg^*n (Mihail), thank you for joining us today and sharing your insights into playing. And WELCOME to their Opposition. To start with our very own ^*bLadystar17^*n (Rosemary) in her working garb as BILAssist and ^*bGeofspa^*n (Geof) long time BIL worker in many roles.

A warm WELCOME to our Guest Opposition ^*bHannie^*n and ^*bAaronh^*n - Han and Aaron will take their seats on the third board."|pg||

^*bNotes for the user:^*n
 
During the bidding only the actual hand (the one that is to bid) is displayed. At the end of the auction the hand of the leader is shown.
 
As North-South are the hosts, only their hands are displayed during the play when they are declaring. All four hands are displayed when North-South are defending.
 
You can display any hand at any time if you click on the player's name. Additional click on the name will show all hands.
 
After the hand is played you can repeat it on your own playing all four hands, trick by trick.|pg||

nt|^*binquiry:^*n I guess everyone would open this hand 1@C. I really like this hand at this point.
|pg||

sk|S|mb|1D!|an|can be short|
at|
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n This is common problem - having weak Major doubleton is not good to bid NT if can be avoided. Some players use even 3 cards Major responses...|pg||
sk|W|at||mb|p|pg||
sk|N|mb|1S|
nt|^*binquiry:^*n This hand is ^*bprobably^*n good enough for 2@S rebid, but Misho knows I am unbalanced for 1@S and he will not pass with a spade fit.|pg||
sk|E|at||mb|p|pg||
sk|S|mb|2S|
nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Unfortunately problem stay... Now I have choice to bid 1NT (probably best) or to bid 2@s support with 3 cards or to bid 2(3) @c raise. Because of upper limit of non inv hand and good fillers in @c I will prefer 2@s bid... By the way playing Walsh (majors first) it is definitely 3 card support.|pg||
sk|W|at||mb|p|pg||
sk|N|mb|4S|
nt|^*binquiry:^*n He doesn't know I have a good hand, but he knows I have an unbalanced one.... Now he knows I have a good hand. This will end the bidding since I didn't ask him for advice. His 2@S bid limited his hand so I am the captain...|pg||
mb|ppp|
sk|E|at||pc|DQ|pg||
sk|N|nt|^*bKibitzer:^*n Too bad, missed 6@c. Looks like a laydown.
^*binquiry:^*n He is right, we missed a nice slam in clubs. The problem is how to handle 4@S.
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Looks like we miss clear @c slam, that's why along the way to game is good idea something to bid - in this board 4@h Splinter. Nowadays Splinters are used for limit raises to game, include short suit while counting tricks.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n I can handle a spade loser, 4-2 spades, I just let them get their spade. So I will win and play three round of spades.|pg||

nt|^*binquiry:^*n Hey... look ^*i(West has)^*n a club void... the @D play was necessary!

Any questions? Other than 6@C would have been reached if I had bid 2@S instead of 1@S or 2 NT instead of 4@S.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n What if you had 5-7?

^*binquiry:^*n I would have surely bid 2@S with 5-7.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Any way to show singleton @H?

^*binquiry:^*n I could have bid 4@H over 2@S to show a singleton heart on the way to 4@S.
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n That will be my bid... By the way, if they bid their @h, will be much easier for us to bid slam, hehe.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Would you consider biddding 3@c over your partner's 2@s bid?

^*binquiry:^*n I can use 2nt with Misho to find out if he has club support and only 3@Ss. If I am going to bid clubs, i would bid 4@C. 3@C should be forcing however...|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n With this hand can North begin with strong 2@c?

^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Too weak for 2@c.|pg||

nt|^*binquiry:^*n I like this hand too... I always like solid majors... :) but the vul is poorish for too much reckless bidding by us... I am likely to bid something however...|pg||

^*binquiry:^*n I would love to bid 3@H here with a jump... Hope I get a chance... I am not going to risk a 4@h bid with this hand... if Misho passes... here... not at this vul... and even 3@H might be too much...|pg||
sk|S|mb|1S|nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Another common problem in competition... side short suit and no take out available. 2@c doesn't look good because bad @c suit and normally show 6 cards. 1NT used by some players is not for me without good @d stop. So remains 1@s, but you can use 4 cards overcall only with good hand about 13 points at least.|pg||

sk|e|pc|DA|
nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Because we use with Ben jump suit as suit + fit convention, he can't bid 3@h with his hand. If you didn't read yet Robson-Segal book "Partnership Bidding in Bridge", read it now... ^*i(a free pdf:  ^*Hwww.geocities.com/daniel_neill_2000/sys/PartnershipBiddingAtBridge.ZIP^*N)^*n|pg||
nt|^*baaronh:^*n There are at least four reasonable calls with the South hand. I don't really fault 1@s, although it isn't my choice. I would double but 2@c is reasonable, and pass is also reasonable.|pg||
sk|N|at|
^*binquiry:^*n I hope to throw my spade away on the dummies clubs so that I don't have to risk a finessee in spades.... so I have 11 tricks now.|pg||

nt|^*binquiry:^*n Most of the questions might have to do with the 1@S bid... so ask Misho....
^*bQ:^*n Misho why didn't you bid 2@c instead of 1@s?
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Not 6 cards, not enough good suit for 5 cards.
^*bQ:^*n But it's better than @s's!?
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n It is longer, but not better, and is 1 level more, dangerous.|pg||

nt|^*binquiry:^*n A third hand I like... a whole lot, especially after the 1@D opening.|mb|1S|pg||
sk|E|
at|
^*bhannie:^*n I have extras but not enough to consider anything but 2@h.
|mb|2H|pg||
sk|S|mb|p|at|
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n I didn't bid dbl (support dbl BBO advanced), so Ben know I don't have 3@s.|pg||
sk|W|nt|^*baaronh:^*n My hand just improved a lot, and I want to make trouble for them - we don't figure to go down more than 1 here. It's tough to try to find your fit at the 4 or 5 level. 
^*bsylad:^*n West bidding 4@h cause he knows East has an opening hand at these colours - otherwise better not bid at Eeast. 
^*baaronh:^*n The disadvantage is that hannie may play me for more than I have.|mb|4H|pg||
sk|E|nt|^*bhannie:^*n Had partner bid only 3@h, I would certainly have bid game. I'm thinking about what to do if Ben bids 4@s.|pg||
sb|e|sk|S|at|
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Will be interesting if he ^*i(inquiry)^*n doubles... Will be not penalaty double, but maximum double - have points and nothing to bid... With 3 small @h I will not stay, but will bid 5@d... To double with 5@d - 4@c I will bid 4NT, with 5@d - 5@c - 5@c...|pg||
sk|N|nt|^*binquiry:^*n I don't have many points, but I have great distribution, I am not stopping short of 4@S or 5@D here, even if they didn't bid to 4@h. The question now is should I bid 4@S here, it is lower than 5@D, and my @ss are fairly strong. Or should I bid 5@D. The problem is, I don't know which is best. Sometimes you have to guess. I will guess to stay low. Probably supporting @d would be better but if they bid 5@h and partner doubles, I don't want a @D lead.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n There is a bridge saying that goes "With 6-5 come alive". Here I have 6 @Ss and 5 @Ds, so I am willing to do a lot of bidding.|
mb|4S|pg||
sk|E|nt|^*bhannie:^*n As expected... Aaron hasn't shown a strong hand, just good heart support. I don't think 5@h will necessarily make, but if it does then it will score quite a bit better than 4@sX. On a bad day 4@s might even make, for example if Ben has a heart void. Still, I'm going to double to take what I expect is a small plus.|
mb|d|pg||
at||sk|S|mb|p|pg||
sk|W|nt|^*baaronh:^*n And I have to respect this Dbl and sit for it, although 4@s may well be cold.
^*bsylad:^*n Dbl is in my mind a bad bid - pass would still invite to a higher contract - Partner will dbl when it's right if you pass - and will never bid if you dbl - West could have helped the defence by bidding 4@d.|
mb|p|pg||
sk|N|nt|^*binquiry:^*n OK... Here hannie is not doubling based upon @H winners so I have to consider (reconsider) my decision to play in spades rather than @Ds. If I had to guess, I would say hannie is looking at KJx(x) of spades so I have two spade losers. The question is will I lose control if forced in hearts. I can afford to lose 2@S and one in a minor. If Misho has solid enough diamonds to make 5@D, we may still make 4@S, so I will pass. This could be wrong... We will see.|mb|p|pg||
pc|HA|pc|H8|pc|HT|
nt|^*baaronh:^*n This is suit preference, I want a diamond.|pg||
pc|S4|
at|
^*binquiry:^*n OK. The @C finesse will have to be taken, the @s finesse is surely off... Let's see what we can find out....|pg||

pc|H7|pc|S6|pc|H6|pc|H3|
nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Difficulte hand... while establishing your suits, they play @h and shorten your @s... The main question in such boards is to play to make or to play for less lose.|pg||
at||pc|D6|pc|DA|pc|D2|pc|DJ|pg||
pc|HJ|
nt|^*bhannie:^*n We are playing a "forcing defense", the hope is that declarer will run out of trumps. If Ben started with 6 trumps and he now ruffs for the 3rd time, he will be down to the same number as Aaron and I.|pg||
pc|H9|pc|HQ|
nt|^*binquiry:^*n The fear here is losing control.. If I ruff this or play a second round of spades, I could run out of trumps and go down a lot. Here I can pitch a diamond, and they can not continue hearts due to the @S in dummy...|pc|D7|pg||
at||pc|C3|pc|C4|pc|CT|pc|CJ|pg||
at|
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n The spirit of the winner sometimes lead me to -1400, but most of time is better to play to make! And I like Ben as partner, because he do have such spirit!|pc|S3|pc|SJ|pc|SQ|pc|SK|pg||

nt|^*baaronh:^*n Interesting hand.
^*bhannie:^*n Please note that we would have made 5@h, our hands fit very well.
^*binquiry:^*n If I had played it wide open, @C to the dummy, and @S I will make.... but if hannie has 4@S it is down a lot on that line.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Would it have been better in @Ds?

^*binquiry:^*n I am glad to see that 5@D is also down one... Lose 1 @S, 1 @C and 1 @D.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Did J@d show a singleton?

^*baaronh:^*n I could easily have been falsing, but after the 10@h I played earlier it should show a stiff.
^*bhannie:^*n It would be an unusual card to play, it certainly looked like a singleton.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Was that Lavinthal discard?
^*baaronh:^*n No.

^*bQ:^*n High even, higher of two side suits?
^*baaronh:^*n Lavinthal is when you're out of the suit your partner leads.|pg||

^*binquiry:^*n So far, easy hand to bid... Everyone bids their major in response to Stayman....|pg||
at||sk|E|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|
nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n When you see about 28+ hcp with p, you need to begin thinking about slam try... If he have no values in @d, remain only 30 points in other 3 suits, so slam is max on finesse.|mb|4D!|an|Splinter|pg||
at||sk|W|mb|p|pg||
sk|N|
nt|^*binquiry:^*n 3@D would be forcing, so this is a Splinter. I would like my hand better if the @DAK values were in the other suits... but I have an awful lot to give up with a 4@H bid. Opposite a void in @D, however, my hand loses a lot of value. I could cue-bid spades, or use Blackwood, but I think I will make a quantitative raise in hearts... Here this has to be a Splinter, as it is how he agrees to play in @hs, trial bids you have to have established a fit before the trial bid.|mb|5H|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n What does 5@h mean?
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n It is clear ask for trump quality, because opps didn't bid suit. If they do and investigating control in their suit is impossible, I will take it as aks for control in opps suit.
^*bsylad:^*n 5@h = bid 6 with good @hs.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n The question was why not Blackwood... The answer is 
1) I don't have control of club, 
2) I need good hearts to make a slam, and 
3) I don't want an lead directing double or absence of a lead directing double to suggest how the defense should go. I just hope he doesn't have a diamond void....|pg||
at||sk|E|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|mb|6H|pg||
mb|ppp|pg||
sk|E|nt|^*bhannie:^*n The lead against a slam often makes a difference between a make or going down. I have a clear lead here. It is often a good idea to make an aggressive lead against a small slam in a suit. Leading the club king sets up a trick, and who knows, maybe I get a trump trick.|
pc|CK|pg||
sk|N|
at| I like the sight of this dummy. If Ben ruffs several diamonds in dummy he sets up my heart 10.|pg||
nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Slam is not that easy as it looks like. The danger is 4-1 in trumps, if you ruff 2 times @d at dummy. It is hard to decide what will be better - going for 1 @d ruff + 4th @s or J@s fall if 4-2 or some kind of squeeze. If not: taking all trumps and trying to squeeze them: both in @s, one in @d and other in @c. And finally if still @d and @c are not winers, will take @s.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n This is looking pretty good... only one loser... (a club), but do we have 12 tricks...? 3 @S, 4 @H, 2 @D, 1 @C is 10 tricks... I can ruff diamonds in dummy or @Cs in my hand, but I need to score 2 ruffs in either North or South to get 12 tricks... Ruffing 1@C and 1@D only gets me one extra trick, as I counted 4@Hs already.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n Since I plan to ruff clubs in my hand, I duck the first @C trick, as if I win and pull two round of @HS then duck a club they might be able to lead a third round of trumps. Then I have to rely on @Ss for 4 tricks.|
pc|C3|pg||
nt|^*baaronh:^*n Since Ben opened 1NT he should have at least 2 clubs, so I hope this lead is from KQ tight :P. It must be or he wouldn't duck. I might have made life easier for Han by encouraging clubs there, but he should have an easy red suit exit.|pg||
at||pc|C7|pc|C8|pg||
nt|^*bhannie:^*n Generally Aaron and I would play UDCA, upside down count and attitude. We haven't discussed whether we would do differently for this purpose. I will assume that Aaron doesn't like clubs (7 looks fairly high, so negative). Ben likely has the club jack, but not the 10. If he had the 10, he could just win the trick.|pg||
nt|^*bhannie:^*n I had 6 HCP, dummy had 13, so partner has at most 4-6 points. I really don't want to play a spade, because that would give away the suit if partner has the queen and Ben the king. A diamond is dangerous, partner likely has some diamond honors (because Ben liked the diamond Splinter) so it could finesse these. A heart could also make things easier for Ben. So I think I'm going to play the club.|
pc|CQ|pc|CA|pc|C2|pc|CJ|pg||
nt|^*bhannie:^*n That is very good news, looks like Ben started with Jx of clubs.
^*baaronh:^*n On this hand his problem is likely spades so you don't want to pitch those and clue him in.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n I don't want to win my diamonds too quickly, who knows, the @SJ might fall, so I  don't want to discard a @C or a @S on the second diamond. I need to ruff two clubs, and I want the 4th @S in case it is a winner.... OK... here I can afford one round of trumps, win in dummy, as I need @hA to ruff 4th club....|

nt|^*baaronh:^*n sorry Han, I should encourage clubs.
^*bhannie:^*n To be honest, I wasn't sure what carding we were using Aaron, maybe we should play standard carding in the BIL.
^*baaronh:^*n Standard is fine if you like.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Explain Splinter bid please.

^*binquiry:^*n A Splinter bid is jump in a suit when a non-jump would be forcing... It establish trumps... Here it also invited slam, since with no slam interest, South would bid 4@h, not 4@D.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Can 6@h be made? 

^*bhannie:^*n 6@h can be made by ruffing one diamond in dummy and later finessing the spade jack, but it is not clear that that is the best line if you only see the NS hands.|pg||

sk|S|at|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n To invite or to bid game - often question. The answer is: bid game, very simple really. As my friend Boyan (^*bppilot^*n in BBO) like to say, the invite means: "Have you GOOD MAXIMUM?". The reason is: even 30% games are better than scores statistically. It is not apply to slams. For small slam you need at least clear 50% and for grand about 70%. Additional advantage of bidding direct games is not to give opps info. Lot of game can be done on wrong lead.|mb|4H|pg||

nt|^*bhannie:^*n This is an interesting lead problem. I am certainly not leading a trump. I think this auction doesn't call for an attacking lead, so I won't lead a diamond either, as it is more likely to give away a trick. So I choose between my black suits, which look almost identical. I favor spades over clubs as partner could have made a lead directing double of clubs.|pg||
nt|^*bhannie:^*n Which spot you lead is a matter of partnership agreement, but I strongly prefer the lowest. MUD or top of nothing are poor agreements in my opinion, partner won't know if I have a doubleton.|pc|S3|pg||
sk|N|
nt|^*binquiry:^*n OK.. I win 3@H, 3@S, 2@C and 1@D. I can ruff a @D. I lose both major aces and maybe the @d king... and maybe a @S ruff... Can be down one to making five.|
pc|S4|pg||
nt|^*baaronh:^*n OK, now what does this lead indicate? It shows 3 cards, to begin with, since we lead 3/5 and han can't have 5. So Ben has 3 spades, including either the Q or the J. So I put the 9, which can't lose and now he still has to guess the J.|
pc|S9|pc|SQ|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n The @H jack was to try to give the impression I was going to hook in @hs. Remember, I am worried about @S ruffs.

^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Notice "finesse" with J. Good players love to hide cards they hold. Good...
Playing J@h instead of Q@h can make East to duck, when was necessary to take trump.|pc|HJ|pg||
nt|^*bhannie:^*n If Ben continues hearts I have to think whether I want to take the 2nd or 3rd round. Of course I never hold up until the 4th round. It is common to hold up once more, then, if Ben plays another I can clear the suit. I see no reason to do otherwise.|pc|H2|pc|H4|pc|H3|pg||

nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Ah, 1 time more bad brake for Ben. We love to say in BG: "When suits begin to brake often for you, it is because you become too good" :). Now what is in the mind of Ben? Probably curse Misho he didn't made game try and we didn't find much better 3NT contract :). It is only joke, we cant bid it after 1NT opening, because side bids didn't show @h fit...|pg||
nt|^*bhannie:^*n Now that we agreed on standard signals I know Aaron does not like diamonds. I am glad I didn't lead one. if Ben finesses in diamonds I will likely clear the heart suit. I have no ruffing potential, but perhaps dummy and declarer have. As I said before, holding up the ace 3 rounds is almost never right.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n OK... If I continue @Hs, they can prevent me from ruffing a @D in dummy, so that puts me back to 9 sure tricks... But I have endplay chances. For sure he will return a trump.|pc|HK|pc|C6|pc|H5|pc|HA|pg||
nt|^*baaronh:^*n Now we know Ben has at least 10 points in the minors. So almost surely both minor aces, plus either both Js or the @DK or @DQ.
^*bhannie:^*n I can see that Aaron likes clubs as he pitched the 6 and I can see the 9, 8 and 7. However, if he was very eager for a club lead then he might have pitched the @c6 earlier. So I follow up on my original plan of clearing the hearts.|

^*bhannie:^*n You are right, looks like that was a mistake but it didn't cost.|pg||
nt|^*bQ:^*n Is 1NT response to opening bid always forcing because I sometimes think seven tricks is easier made than 8?
^*bhannie:^*n That depends on your agreements. However, I think we should restrict the questions to the hands we play :).
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n in BBO advanced 1NT respose to 1M opening is F1.|pg||

nt|^*binquiry:^*n Technically I have to open this 1@D, but I made a decision in the fourth seat to violate the normal bidding agreement, for ease of rebid over likely 1@S bid by partner. If I open 1@D, I have a very difficult rebid if partner bids 1@S, I don't like to reverse with this hand, because of possible misfit.|pg||

nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n To bid @s or not? The answer is: depend of strength... If you have at least INV hand, need to bid @s. This is Bergen convention in BBO advanced. As we can see we overbid a few...

nt|^*binquiry:^*n The common question here was why did I open 1@H on 4 card suit. The answer is rebid problem over a 1@S response... So the next question is isn't the hand strong enough to reverse. The answer is if my black suits were reversed, i would open 1@D and reverse, but over a 1@S response I don't want to force too much in case his hand is all @ss... Reverse the suits, if his hand is all spades, that is ok too.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n I don't have to alert 1@H. Our agreement is that we open on five card suit, but I don't have to bid as we agree. As long as my partner has the same info it is fine to deviate.|pg|| 
nt|^*bhannie:^*n Interesting thoughts Ben, I would never have opened 1@h on that hand.
^*baaronh:^*n me neither :P. I'd rebid it 2nt over 1@s.

^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Thinking 1 or more bids/plays ahead like Ben is typical for real experts... The easiest way to make 1 trick more is to play small @s from dummy and hope West to not put his @sK.|pg||

sk|N|mb|1C|nt|^*binquiry:^*n Too strong for 1NT... so ... 1@C.....|pg||
sk|E|mb|1H|nt|^*bhannie:^*n Some would overcall 2@h on my hand, preemptive. I prefer not to do that with opening values, even when partner is a passed hand. This one I might have though, very unlikely that we have game.|pg||
at||sk|S|mb|p|pg||
sk|W|mb|2h|pg||
sk|N|mb|d|nt|^*binquiry:^*n Blah.. can't risk 2NT now.. I don't like double due to the doubleton @D, but they are very good @ds, so i am going to struggle here.. I just hope to push them to 3. level... If partner has spades he is really broke... and if he had clubs he would have raised last round unless he was really broke... so we expect him to have long diamonds.|pg||
at||sk|E|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|mb|2N!|an|puppet for 3!c|nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n 2NT cant be natural bid, so I will try to tell Ben by it, that I have no points, but my hand look like better even without points.|pg||
at||sk|W|mb|p|pg||
sk|N|mb|3C|nt|^*binquiry:^*n Well pass might look right, but do I think my partner really has hearts when I have three and they bid hearts twice?  I think this is a way to show a bad hand and the suit he will eventually bid (probably diamonds)... I wonder if I should bid diamonds for the lead to come to me? That would be brilliant, unless he was going to bid 3@Cs.... so as much as I would like to declarer with a 3@D bid, I will bid 3@C like I am supposed to....|pg||
at||sk|E|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Now I have a problem... It is almost clear Ben have 4@s, but is not clear about @c - he can have balanced hand 18-20 pts.|pg||
mb|3H!|at||
at| I have 6@ds and he didn't know about them and I didn't show my strength - it can be up to 8 points. ^*i(Not really. With a goodish hand like 7 or 8 points he could bid 3@D instead of 2NT to puppet to diamonds).^*n|pg||
at||sk|W|mb|p|pg||
sk|N|mb|3N|nt|^*binquiry:^*n The best bid with my hand over 2@H is pass... But I decided to just try to push them... I know we can't make whatever it is we bid. Just hope they don't know it...|pg||
at||sk|E|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|mb|4D|pg||
sk|W|mb|p|sb|eI'd guess that Misho has 3-2-5-3 shape, and Ben has Kx of hearts|pg||sb|e|
sk|N|mb|4S|nt|^*binquiry:^*n OK... I don't know what he has now... but I don't think I can stop bidding now... surely we are in trouble... but this 4@d bid has to be forcing.
^*baaronh:^*n Am I also allowed to ask questions after the hand? :P
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Of course. :)
^*binquiry:^*n Dbl was takeout.|pg||
at||sk|e|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|mb|p|nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n I have also singleton @h, which is nice in my hand for suit contract, and Q@c is like A@c :).|mb|p|pg||
sk|w|mb|p|at|
^*baaronh:^*n OK then - glad it's you leading han.|pg||
sk|e|nt|^*bhannie:^*n 3-2-5-2 shape makes sense, because with that shape Misho would not have a suitable bid even if he had a 10-count.|
sb|nProbably wish I had passed 2 hearts... :)|pg||sb|n|
sk|n|pc|C3|nt|^*bhannie:^*n I've told them what I think Misho's hand is, now we'll see if I was right.
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Sorry Ben, was bidded too aggressive, need to bid 3@d sign off...
^*bBILmanager:^*n No sorries in the BIL Misho :)|pg||
sb|sWhen try for risky game was unsuccesful it is good idea to say sorry to angry p :)|pg||sb|s|
sb|eWell, I was off by 1 card but I thought his hand was quite a bit better than this.|pc|CT|pc|CA|pc|C5|pg||sb|e|
nt|^*bhannie:^*n Looks like Ben has hidden the @c2 and Aaron asked for a diamond return.
^*baaronh:^*n I pick a middle card to show no preference -- if I had the @HK I would play @CJ to ask him to underlead.
|pc|C6|pc|C4|pc|S2|pc|C9|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n If you bid 3@D over 3@C that would have been perfect description.
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n OK, ty.|
sb|sBe nice and love your p - mine rule of succesful partnership, especially if you put him in fire :)|pg||sb|s|
pc|D3|pc|D8|pc|DT|pc|DQ|nt|^*bhannie:^*n I see no need to cash the heart ace first.|

^*bhannie:^*n I said you were 3-2-5-3 Misho :)
^*bMishoVnBG:^*n lol 
^*bhannie:^*n I didn't think 1 heart because I thought Ben was more likely to have 2 for the double. So I failed.|pg||
nt|^*binquiry:^*n Next... Take a look at my explanation and the fact that 3@D would have been great spot for us... 3@H was just too much.....|pg||

sk|N|mb|p|nt|^*binquiry:^*n We can all agree with my pass... I will not bid on this hand unless partner bids spades or forces me to bid somehow....|pg||
sk|E|mb|p|at|
^*bhannie:^*n At different colors I might open 3@C, this is a nice 6-card suit. However, at vulnerable against not, I would never do so, and especially not in 2nd seat where I am most likely to preempt partner.|pg||
sk|S|mb|1N|nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n I am not fan of using 1NT opening with such distribution... but I am afraid they may have major game...|pg||
at||sk|W|mb|2H|pg||
sk|N|mb|p|pg||
sk|E|at|
^*bhannie:^*n Do we play Woolsey, Aaron?
^*baaronh:^*n Not at the moment. This is natural.
^*bhannie:^*n Oh OK.|pg||
nt|^*bhannie:^*n Normally Aaron and I would play a convention that is similar to Cappeletti (for those of you who are familiar with that) but better (we think). Then 2@h would show hearts and a minor and I would pass because he would likely have diamonds.|pg||
at| Now I still pass :). At these colors he would likely have a decent suit and attractive shape to bid over 1NT. There is certainly no reason to believe that clubs is a better fit.|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|nt|^*bMishoVnBG:^*n Now bidding @d will be ^*ubig mistake^*n and can only help them to find their game. I can lose score here of course, but game is important at IMPs, not scores...|mb|p|pg||
sk||nt|^*binquiry:^*n We play 2/4 leads, so the lead of the @c6 looks odd to you... Everyone else would lead the @c7 from this holding.|pc|C6|

^*baaronh:^*n Leads?

^*baaronh:^*n If playing 2/4 you lead low from xx.
