fp|1|ht|d|at|BILmanager: Celebrating BIL 5th birthday, on September 7th BIL members had a chance to see the clash of the Mentor/Mentee partnerships in a Listen to the Experts style session. They talked to kibitzers about the hand as they bid/play and kibitzers were given an opportunity to ask questions at the end of each hand. 

A warm WELCOME to...|pg||

sk|S|at|aspiring: I have 7 HCP so I will pass. Unless Howard is strong and bids again I have nothing in my hand to help him.
|mb|p|pg||
sk|W|at|grizz: With good middle cards, this should be ok for NT - with weaker suits i might use Garbage Stayman and pass whatever partner bids.

up|52|nt|hondo717: Des did well to duck her diamond ace.
grizz: Yes, and Pedro did well not to continue @ds.

BILmanager: Kibs you can ask your questions now.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: How many points do you need for 1NT overcall?
grizz: 15-18. And we play all systems on.

Kibitzer: When do I use Garbage Stayman and when do I refrain?
grizz: I had good middle cards, so thought 1NT had chances. With bad suits and this kind of shape, I would bid 2@c Garbage Stayman and pass any answer.
hondo717: And since Pete only has 4 diamonds, it is barely possible they would end up in a 4-2 fit if Pedro is 3-3-2-5.
grizz: Yes, but good chances of a 4-4, or some kind of 7 card fit.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: What did the 8@h discard signal at trick 9?
aspiring: Showing an honor in @h.

Kibitzer: Why would it made a difference if Des did take her ace, she had no clubs to lead?
hondo717: By ducking her ace Des prevented Pedro from being able to cash a 4th diamond, because he had no way to get to dummy.
Kibitzer: Also avoids a finesse of Howard.

sk|E|at|PedroG: Seems I'm going to have action again :). I have the HCP for NT but not the shape :). Let's see what Pete has to say, I have a nice rebid of @h or @s.
|mb|1S|pg||
sk|S|at|aspiring: I have 13 HCP but I can not double here as I have got only two @cs in my hand and no 5 card suit to bid. So I pass and see if I can come into the bidding later on or double a contract of theirs.

sk|E|at|PedroG: He still may have some @hs, I will show them now. This is a 12-14 rebid lie a bit on the strengh ... but can show a bit more now.

sk|W|at|grizz: Partner is probably 6-4, with extras.

sk|E|mb|p|pg||
sk|S|at|aspiring: I can not double this contract because I do not have enough @ss in my hand and I can count only 2 winners from Pedro's bidding. I will lead trump though as to shorten his trumps in dummy.
|mb|p|
pc|S5|
sb|Wglp|sb|Ety Pete|pg||sb|W|sb|E|
sk|E|nt|grizz: Good lead - when dummy is short in trump, trump is a good lead to kill ruffs.
hondo717: That is a good lead, as Pete rates to be short in hearts, and shouldn't have too many spades either, as he did not raise. And Pedro has at most 2 diamonds, since he has to be at least 5-4-2-2.

PedroG: ty
grizz: Nice.
hondo717: Told the kibs, you made the best lead, Des. Nice going.
aspiring: ty|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Why Grizz you did not bid 2@c instaed of 1NT after 1@s of Pedro?
grizz: If I had 3+@ss, then 2@c would stand out but with only Jx, it's better to go slower. We might be on a screaming misfit, with bad chances for NT.
hondo717: Well, this is what makes bridge interesting, as I think I would bid 2@C with Pete's hand, because of his good 6-card suit.
grizz: If I count shortness points in @h for a 2@c bid, and @h turns out to be pard's second suit, then we have trouble. If I know where we are going after a 2/1 bid, then I make it - here I was hedging a little.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: In which case would you have rebid spades, Pedro?
PedroG: I'm trying to find a second suit, why rush on a 4@S bid.
Kibitzer: Good point, so if hearts would have not been there in your hand, you would have done so?
Kibitzer: Is it ever reccommended to rebid your suit to show extra length instead of showing a second suit?
PedroG: I have extras, if I was min I would rebid Spades.
hondo717: Typically, with a weak 6-4 you rebid your six card suit first, with a strong six-4, you bid your second suit as Pedro just indicated.
grizz: I told the kibs during the auction that pard was probably 6-4 with extras so I got Pedro's message loud and clear.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Why doesn't Pedro go directly to 4@s?
PedroG: If partner can't move over 3@s we may not have game.
grizz: Pedro played that one at IMPs, to make, which is correct.
hondo717: Indeed.
grizz: At matchpoints, you risk going down for the sake of an overtrick. So after winning the first @c finesse, at matchpoints he might play back to @hA, pull trump, and lead the last @c, hoping S started with KJ - makes 6 then. Risk is that Howard held up on the @cK with Kxx which is just the sort of master play that Howard would make!

|pg||
sk|N|at|hondo717: We are playing DONT, so 2@D here shows diamonds and a major suit. I have found it pays to compete over 1NT, especially if not vul. With a six card suit, I will compete with as little as 8 or 9 points. Also with 5/5. With 5/4 I try to have 11 or more, with 4/4 an opening hand.
aspiring: Howard is showing @d and a higher ranking suit.
|mb|2D|an|@d + major|pg||
sk|E|nt|PedroG: Here we use Lebensohl, if I know how to write the convention name :). I have an invitational bid available. The 2NT is a relay to 3@c. 2@s would be signoff and 3@s Game Forcing.
|mb|2N|an|relay to 3@c|pg||
at|hondo717: They are playing a convention known as Lebensohl, used when I compete over 1NT. I don't recommend it for non-experts as it is very complicated.

sk|S|mb|p|pg||sb|E|
sk|W|at|grizz: That is game invitational with 5+@s. Here is the Leb scheme: 2@s would have been natural and NF. 3@s would have been natural, 5+ and forcing. So 2NT-3@c-3@s is invitational, and I can't accept with this hand. I have a mini, and no ruffing value - so pass.

aspiring: So looking at dummy Howard has the A@h now :). His second suit can't be @s as Pedro has shown 5 and Pete has got 3 plus my 2 = 10.
|pg||
pc|C4|pc|C2|pc|CJ|pc|CT|pg||
pc|ST|pc|S2|pc|S5|pc|S4|at|hondo717: 2nd hand low is generally right. Now I know I can take my ace of spades and play another spade.

pc|S9|pc|SA|pc|S6|pc|S3|at|2nd hand low was still right. They missed game, and I am trying to beat a part score, so we come out ahead. As you can see, my interference did make it hard for them to bid. But I think Pedro underbid a bit. And a good example of why I think Lebensohl is too complicated for all but experts.

grizz: lol
PedroG: :)
aspiring: vwd
PedroG: ty all|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: I personally think Pedro should have forced instead of inviting by bidding 3@S directly over 2@D. The hand is too strong to just invite but seeing that the @hQ was useful helped me reach that decision.
grizz: Yes, we are not yet done with Lebensohl lessons :).
PedroG: :).|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Pedro, with 11 HCPs why aren't you in a game?
PedroG: I downgrade a bit my Q@h.
grizz: Yes, @hQ is unlikely to pull her full weight in this auction - @h is likely to be Howard's suit. But if the @hQ were @h2, I would still bid 3@s forcing with the East hand.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Is this the wrong time to give your 5 card suit one point?
grizz: I would not add any shape points to the E hand yet, early in the auction - maybe later. Risk is that the shape points are in pard's second suit, and that can backfire.

BILmanager: So easy to be wise when we can see all 4 hands.
Kibitzer: Easy to be an armchair quarterback :).

hondo717: That auction called for a trump lead. Pedro is short in hearts and I have long hearts.

grizz: East usually has only 2 on this auction, but trump lead might surrender a natural trump trick. And I thought that Howard would think that, ergo.....|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Hondo forgot to give @D ruff, no, (gives 2 tricks.. am I wrong...)?
hondo717: Yes, I could give Des a diamond ruff. I made a bad inference. I thought since Pete played a diamond back to his hand instead of ruffing a club, he had 2 diamonds and 2 clubs.

sk|N|at|hondo717: Over artificial bids, if you have the suit you can double for the lead. On this hand it is wrong for 2 reasons, the most important being I am on lead :). However, if Pedro were the original spade bidder, and I had hearts, I could make a double.

PedroG: Sry Pete I chiken out :). Should have asked for the @sQ.
grizz: :) Good stop pard!
PedroG: ty Pete.
hondo717: Yes, goes down on a diamond lead if Dessie has the ace, should not be in slam. And if clubs are not 3-3 it still goes down. Even 5 can go down if Pete is really unlucky.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Would 5@D have asked for the @sQ?
grizz: Yes, and then 6@c would say I have both the trump Q and the @cK.
Kibitzer: What would you say if you did not have @SQ?
Kibitzer: Pass :).
grizz: Rofl! Then 5@s.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Just curious about the mini-splinter: wouldn't a cue worked just as well and given Pedro to cue his @d it seems you can't avoid six that way?
grizz: Yes, but mini-splinters are not SAYC.
hondo717: Six is a very bad slam. Takes a 3-3 club break and the ace of diamonds onside. They should not be in it. Pedro did well to stop in 5.
grizz: Yes, that is not a great slam. @dA onside is 50%, and 3-3 is 41%. Overall 20+%. If the @dK were in the W hand, might be more inclined to bid it.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: What is the deciding factor not to continue with slam when holding 4 of 5 keycards?
PedroG: My worries were 3 small clubs, and one of my keys is on partner's Splinter.
grizz: You do not want to be in slam off 2 aces, or 1 ace and the K of trump, or 1 ace or the K of trump and the Q too.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Does 4@h Splinter promise club control?
hondo717: Well a Splinter by Pete is very descriptive, change Pedro's @hA to @dA, and six is a good contract. The point is: a Splinter allows you to evaluate what points are "good" points. Pedro knows his @hA is ok, but it would be better somewhere else.
grizz: Right - the best possible holding opposite a Splinter is xxx, xxxx, or xxxxx. Then the shortness works overtime, and all outside values are working together in both hands.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: What does wasted values mean?
hondo717: The ace of hearts is kind of wasted. Basically it is best if your honors mesh with your partner's honors. So, wasted values are values in suits partner does not have. In this case, the @hA isn't exactly wasted, but it would be better somewhere else. As I said, make the @hA the @dA, and the @d8 a low heart, then slam is a good contract. And that is the value of Splinters. It allows partner to evaluate whether or not his points fit well.
grizz: Yes, if the @hA were the @dA, slam would be a good bet ... lol ... Howard and I are on the same page :).
PedroG: Howard, we can actually say that here@hA is only valued 4 points :).|pg||
nt|grizz: Pedro was absolutely correct to be cautious in that auction. So that hand made slam - does that mean we should be in it? No! That would be "result merchanting" - but not a guide for future bidding. 
hondo717: And the answer is obviously no, because 80% of the time it is down.|pg||
nt||cs|2|ht|b|at|^-{grizz: So we have one of the great contradictions of bridge - if you tailor your bidding to what go you good results in the past,
you may be setting yourself up for bad results in the future. 
Which makes it very difficult for progressing bridge players to get good. 
You are better off learning correct bidding early, so you don't have to unlearn mistakes later.
I know whereof I speak!!!!!}

sk|N|at|hondo717: OK here I will make a negative double. I am not quite strong enough to bid 3@H, but if I double and bid 3@H, that shows my hand.  Making a negative double and then bidding a suit shows a weaker hand than bidding the suit directly. It still shows a good suit, just not a good hand.

hondo717: Well that hand shows the value of preempts. If Pete is quiet, we probably get to 4@H.

grizz: But it makes 2@s, 6@ss and 2 aces.
PedroG: Very nice try Des.
aspiring: Ty, just got tired of defending all the time lol.
grizz: lol
PedroG: lol|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Does your heart bid, Howard, show five or six hearts? 
hondo717: My heart bid shows a weakish hand with 6 hearts or 5 good hearts at least. I am willing to play opposite a doubleton.
Kibitzer: OK, so 4@h you should be in, correct?
aspiring: Yes, we should have been in 4@H.
hondo717: Yes, 4@H is our best spot.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Does negative double show the other major automatically?
hondo717: A negative double guarantees the unbid major, at least 4 card support.

Kibitzer: I don't understand why it is stronger for you to double first and then bid your suit. When you are making a direct double it is just the opposite?
grizz: The Dbl here was Negative - different from an intervenor doubling first and then bidding a suit to show 17+. You need 7+ HCP at the 1. level, 8+ at 2. and 10+ at 3. level.|pg||
nt|Kibitzer: Howard, it seems to me that 3@s (asking for the stopper for NT game) promises 2 hearts. Would 4@h be better than 4@d?
hondo717: This brings up an interesting point. Des has to be prepared for me to bid something other than 3NT over 3@S. So perhaps I should infer that she has 2 @Hs, but I thought since I had 3 @Ds, it would be OK to show diamond support just in case. Another alternative would have been for me to pass the double and see what Des did.

BILmanager: Nome does movies of Hondo's weekly sessions and they are all in the BIL library for you all to use to review and learn from.|pg||
nt|grizz: The dealer had a cruel joke at Howard's expense today - shall we schedule a rematch?
hondo717: Yes, a rematch is in order.
PedroG: It was a big pleasure and always available if you bare with me at the table :).
BILmanager: We might just have to make these a monthly event? Fascinating to see how you think about the bids and play. We are of course especially proud of BIL members ASPIRING and PedroG.
grizz: Monthly works fine for me :).

fp|1|cp||ht|d|at|@4BILmanager: @D@D THANK YOU Howard, DES, Pete and Pedro. This has been a truly great session.

aspiring: Thanks Pete and Pedro, enjoyed. Thanks Howard @h for asking me to play with you again :). Thanks Maureen and happy birthday Billies @H.

grizz: Ditto from me.

hondo717: Yes same here.

PedroG: Ty ALL and ty Maureen for this space. Ty Howards and Des, great to play with you both, is very nice. 
And ty Pete, great friend and Teacher :).

BILmanager: @D@D I hope this session will inspire more Mentor/Mentee pairs to take part in future sessions.
The new Mentor Programme back office should be up and running before the end of the month -  when it is BIL Players can apply for a Mentor and we will do a big push to get more Mentors working in the programme. You will all be notified in due course.

Kibitzer: If you don't have a mentor, how you ever know when you are advanced to move on?
PedroG: But the most important is the teacher.

BILmanager: Any members that think they are Advanced can apply for BIL graduate membership. I send them a list of criteria. If they feel they fit the bill, then so be it.

Kibitzer: Pedro, can I line you up as a mentor before you get filled up :)?

BILmanager: Hondo's mentoring is booked for years to come I think :). To apply for a mentor you have to fill in the application form. One must never approach the Mentors direct.|pg||

   @2During the bidding only the actual hand (the one that is to bid) is displayed.

At the end of the auction only the hand of the leader is shown.

During the play you can see only declarer's hand (and dummy, of course).

You can display any hand at any time if you click on the player's name. Double clicking the name will show all hands.

After the hand is played you can repeat it on your own playing all four hands, trick by trick. You may play whatever cards you like! Just click on the card you wish to play.

%% --------- chat on voice lessons in the BIL ---------
%% BILmanager: @D There will not be voice lessons in the BIl until such time as BBO integrates a fully functioning Voice facility - have listened to some %% sessions using Skype (elsewhere) and was appalled - that is not going to happen here
%% aspiring: skype has been banned here in oman
%% grizz: Mumble is on the horizon though, Pedro knows more about it than i
%% PedroG: yes Mumble may be a good choice. Better voice and it's has been used on vugraph
%% grizz: still i like typed chat better, because there is a permanent record for review
%% analisals: there are  already some better systems already
%% zewzew: ok, thx
%% analisals: good point Pete
%% mick357: i have been tuned into skype lessons and thought quality was okay, may it be location?
%% grizz: the best of all possible solutions would be voice with voice recognition feature that automatically transcribes
%% PedroG: skype is always limited to 10 kibs
%% grizz: y, quality falls off rapidly as number of participants increases
%% grizz: huge difference between even 4 and 5
%% BILmanager->Kibitzers: @D the BBO Vugraphers are trialling mumble at the moment  if that gets integrated into the BBO system we will use it
%% PedroG: voice recording is a good alternative :)
