For those of you who did not see |cp|4|at|^*B'MYTHS'^*N|cp||at|, my first Lecture Hall presentation, my name is ^*BMichael^*N and my BBO User Name is ^*B'Jake'^*N.|pg||at| There are many wonderful teachers donating their time and efforts by offering great free sessions in the Lounge and hopefully this presentation style will compliment their efforts.|pg||at|

To give you some background, I have been teaching bridge for over 30 years. As well I have been a club owner/operator and a bridge director. Bridge is my full time occupation. I have a working agreement with Bridge Base Inc to use their software to make 'movies' (bridge animations) as used in this presentation. Some of my work has been used in commercial CD products. I thank you Fred for your cooperation in getting this presentation off the ground. I also wish to thank the BIL management team for all they have done in putting this project together.|pg||
nt||ht|h|at|^b @2During the lecture, you will not be able to comment or ask questions but at the end, a chat room will be opened for a discussion. You can email me anytime regarding this presentation, lessons or 'movies':|cs|3|at|

|fp|2|cp|4|at|^-BRIDGE WITH TIGER WOODS|pg||3d|5|nt||bg|2|bt||cm|Y|mn|BRIDGE WITH TIGER WOODS|ht|g|at|^b @2Ladies and Gentleman it gives me great pleasure to introduce my special guest, the world's number one golfer, |cp|4|at|^*BTIGER WOODS^*N|cp||at|.|pg||cp|4|at|

^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Hi folks, nice to see all your smiling faces and it is a pleasure to be here.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Why don't you tell our viewers a little of your bridge background Tiger.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2It all started in January of this year. I was playing in a golf tournament in Hawaii.|pg||at| Early Friday morning the horn sounded discontinuing play because of lightning in the area.|pg||at| While waiting in the clubhouse, I walked by a table where some of the fellas were playing cards.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2One of the players, wise-cracking Peter Jacobsen, said, ^*I"Hey, Tiger, care to join us in some Chicago style bridge or do you not think you can afford to lose a little money?"^*N|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I think you might be able to afford it!|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I don't think I need to comment on that but I told them I had never played the game so I sat down to watch.|pg||at| I watched with interest and at times asked questions of my fellow ^*Ikibitzers^*N.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2What was your overall impression?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2WOW!!!!  What a fascinating game!|pg||at| I was so taken up by it, I thought I would learn more about it so I ordered some Bridge Educational Software.|pg||at| I became really enthusiastic about the game and decided I wanted to take lessons.|pg||at| Because of all my travel commitments, I figured that the best way was to take online bridge lessons.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2If I remember correctly, a mutual friend of ours, who is an online student of mine, gave you my email address and you contacted me.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2...as the saying goes, 'and the rest is history'.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2From there, I introduced you to BBO in general and the BIL in particular.|pg||at| Don't worry Tiger, I am not going to reveal your BBO user name.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2If you recall Michael, you suggested I sit in on one of the four viewings of your first Lecture Hall presentation, |cp|4|at|^*B'MYTHS'^*N|cp||at|.|pg||at| It was great.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Thanks Tiger. I informed you of a second presentation and asked you to join me for it. Once again, thanks for obliging and here we are.|pg||at| I know we have discussed this at great length privately but why don't you share with the audience what intrigues you so much about bridge.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Sure Michael, the short answer is that it has so much in common with golf.|pg||at| Maybe I should go over to the yellow board and list some of those features.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Great idea, let's do it.|pg||nt||cs|5|ht|g|at|^b @2{ ^y@3

















}|ht|h|at|^d@D ^e@2One can start playing golf or bridge at a young age and play for the rest of your life.|pg||at|

^d@D @e@2They are both very social games with a chance to meet many interesting people.|pg||at|

^d@D @e@2In both games you can play the game at whatever skill level you wish. If a duffer, a term used in describing most poor golfers, is happy continually shooting 130, a high score, that's wonderful. If someone is content to play in the BIL for years, that is wonderful also.|pg||at|

^d@D @e@2On the other hand, you can take golf lessons and become a scratch golfer, get your scores down to the low 70's, or take bridge lessons and maybe be seen on a vugraph presentation on BBO. Both disciplines have excellent teachers.|pg||at|

^d@D @e@2In both games, you have two types of scoring... in golf there is stroke play and match play.... while in bridge there is IMP's and matchpoint scoring. Also par in golf is like average in bridge.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Now that I think about it Michael, in a lot of ways bridge is better.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Such as.....|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2You can play it all year around in any climate. You can play it at night, in fact 24/7.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Go on, keep selling me on bridge....|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2It is a lot cheaper with regards to both equipment and fees. There are bridge clubs in so many places where there are no golf courses.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Saving your favorite for the last are you Tiger?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Yes, you can play it online anytime with people from all around the world on sites like this one. Thank you, uh..... what did you say his name is.....?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Fred...... Fred Gitelman. He might be in the audience so be nice to him.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Michael, if you keep exciting me on about bridge or if I don't soon get out of this so-called slump, I may leave the Professional Golfers Association, PGA, tour and take up bridge full time.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I can't see that happening but maybe you could arrange a Nike or Buick commercial featuring yourself and some of our BIL members.|pg||at| Work on that for me Tiger, please!!!!!|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Tiger, let's move to what we really want to talk to our audience about and that is |cp|4|at|^*B"HOW TO GO ABOUT LEARNING THE GAME"^*N|cp||at|.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Yes, I think we definitely should but it scares me.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2What do you mean by that?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Let me correct myself. It really doesn't scare me personally as I have similar views about the way people approach becoming better golfers. Maybe "scares me" is the wrong phrase... ^*ILet's just say fasten your seat belts folks!^*N|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Let's go over to the card table and I will lay out a hand for you.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Good idea, I was wondering if we were going to use that deck of cards.|pg||nt||bg||st||pn|Joe Beginner,West,North,East,South,West,North,East|md|2SJ97HJDAK654CK876,SAKT5H873DJ82CAJT,S63HAKT42DQT97CQ3,SQ842HQ965D3C9542|sv|n|sk|s|rh||ah|BIL|ah|Sample Hand|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|P|mb|2NT|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|at|

^b @2Tiger, the way this hand was played is so typical of hands I see played time and again in the BIL.|pg||at|

We will get back to Joe and this hand later, Tiger.|pg||bt||nt||bg|2|ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2For comparison purposes, let's start off by you relating your observations about how most beginner/intermediate golfers go about trying to improve their game.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Good idea! I go to many courses, and I often observe people working on their game at the driving ranges. They hit bucket after bucket of balls and that is fine.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2So what's the problem?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2WHAT'S THE PROBLEM..... for the most part they only use |cp|4|at|^*Bone^*N|cp||at| club... any idea what that is?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I would guess the driver, the number one wood, right?....and is there something wrong with that?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2"Something wrong" you say.... Let me answer it this way|pg||at|, "Does Snow White like short men?"|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Let me explain it this way, the object of the game is to get the ball into the eighteen holes in the fewest number of strokes.|pg||at| Let's take an average golfer whose score is say 100.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I assume you are going to tell me he uses his driver how many times during those 18 holes?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2At most 14 times and probably fewer.|pg||at| So if his score is 100, then, he uses some club ^*Bother^*N than the driver on 86 or more shots|pg||at|, yet he or she spends 95% of their practice time using the driver.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2As the old saying in golf goes|pg||at|, |cp|4|at|^*BYOU DRIVE FOR SHOW AND YOU PUTT FOR DOUGH^*N.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2If you really want to improve your golf score, forget your driver for now and learn to play very well from 100 yards into the hole.|pg||at| You will be amazed at how much you will lower your score when you become more proficient in that area.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Tiger, a similar situation holds true in the bridge world.|pg||at| It is probably my biggest pet peeve and it is more prevalent among the beginner/intermediate players than any other segment of bridge players.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2OK, I feel it coming folks, here is the first area where I warned you to fasten your seat belts.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2^*BMOST BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE BRIDGE PLAYERS ARE GOING ABOUT LEARNING TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS IN THE^*N |CP|4|at|^*BWRONG^*N|cp||at| ^*BMANNER!!!!^*N|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I wish I could be so blunt at post-game interviews with the press. I must admit that after you explained it to me it made a lot of sense.|pg||at| Share your thoughts with our audience as to why you feel that way and I am sure they will realize that your blunt statement was made to benefit them and not insult them.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2As you know I have spent literally hundreds of hours in the BIL, mentoring, teaching, observing or playing with students.|pg||at| So often this is what I see, or some facsimile of it, when I look at a player profile.|pg||at| Here is the profile of Joe Beginner from the demonstration hand.|pg||nt||cs|3|ht|g|3d||at|^b @2{ ^y@3

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I am really not sure how to answer that, Tiger..... at least not politely but I will try to restrain myself.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2It looks like some doctor's shorthand version of someone's medical report who is from Texas and educated at UCLA.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Oh, I have a pretty good idea what most of it means but that is not the point.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2The point is this Tiger.|pg||at| This is an identical situation to the golfers spending 95% of their time using their driver.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Yes, your explanation made a lot of sense to me but share it with all those smiling faces out there, please.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Earlier you said golf was about trying to get the ball in the hole in the fewest number of strokes and most of the strokes are used up from 100 yards in.|pg||at| As we discussed it is important to know the object of the game.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Well, most of what was on Joe Beginner's profile had to do with various bidding devices called conventions.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Do you mean to say that conventions are no good?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I would never say that, Tiger, conventions do have their place.|pg||at| In the case of Joe Beginner and others like Joe, I have found that it is hard to believe that a beginner in the BIL would have ^*Bfull^*N knowledge of all those conventions and still be a beginner.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2After hours of observation in the BIL, years of teaching bridge lessons in a classroom setting and observing people at various bridge clubs, I have come to the following conclusions.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Well don't keep me in suspense....|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I think that for some reason, and for the life of me I have no idea where they get this notion|pg||at|, but many feel that ^*Bthey can't be much of a bridge player if they don't play as many conventions as possible^*N.|pg||at| To use a phrase from my first presentation |cp|4|at|^*BNOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH^*N|cp||at|.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2In the Bermuda Bowl that was held in Monte Carlo in the spring, a pair on the winning team played ^*B4 card majors^*N.|pg||at| Also, another pair on a team that reached the semi-finals did ^*Bnot^*N play ^*BJacoby transfer^*N.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2That seems like quite an accomplishment.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2It is seeing 4 card majors were popular in the thirties, forties and through to the early seventies.|pg||at| Is that not at least some proof that playing all kinds of fancy conventions is not a measure of one's ability as a bridge player?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Sounds like a compelling arguement. Now back to Joe Beginner.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Another thing I am convinced of about people like Joe Beginner is that they really ^*BDON'T KNOW^*N all the conventions they have listed on their profiles.|pg||at| They may have received a ^*Btwo minute lesson^*N from some partner on it some day but is that really ^*Bknowing^*N the convention?|pg||at| Learning and playing conventions in this manner does more harm than good.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Well, Michael, if bidding and conventions are akin to using the driver in golf, then what is the '100 yards to the hole' part of bridge?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2To answer that Tiger, I just have to answer one simple question, ^*B'What is this game all about?'^*N|pg||nt||tu||bg|3|fp|1|ht|d|at|^b @2          THIS GAME IS ABOUT TAKING TRICKS!!!!!|pg||fp|1|ht|g|at|^b @2          THIS GAME IS ABOUT TAKING TRICKS!!!!!|pg||fp|1|ht|j|at|^b @2          THIS GAME IS ABOUT TAKING TRICKS!!!!!|pg||fp|3|at|^c @2

THIS GAME IS ABOUT TAKING TRICKS!!!!!|pg||tu|Y|nt||bg|2|ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2It is as simple as that Tiger!|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2So, get the little white ball in the hole in the fewest strokes possible and get as many tricks as you can. Is it that simple?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2In simplistic terms, that's it Tiger.|pg||at| Bob Hamman, Paul Soloway, Bobby Wolff and Dan Morse, the four players I referred to earlier in the Bermuda Bowl, all have one thing in common....|pg||at| ^*BThey know how to take tricks^*N.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2When you talk about taking tricks, Michael, are you referring to declarer play?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Yes definitely as a declarer ^*Bbut^*N equally important if not even more importantly on defense.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Let me ask you this, if a golfer who shoots a score of 100, works on his driving to the point of being an excellent driver, how will it affect his score?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I would hazard a guess of about 5 strokes so his score would be in the middle 90's.|pg||nt||bg|2|ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Wow!!! That is not what I would call a ^*Bmajor^*N improvement considering the buckets of balls he hit.|pg||at| And if he greatly improved his '100 yard in' game?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I would venture to guess that getting down to the low 80's is within the realm of possibility or maybe even into the high 70's.|pg||at| Take my game this year, I have been awful with my driver|pg||at| but I am still scoring quite well because I have been very good from 100 yards into the hole.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Those figures equate to the improvement in bridge scores.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2What do you mean by that Michael?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I mean that if a BIL member improves his bidding, his scores will become ^*Bmarginally^*N better.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2But here's the kicker Tiger|pg||at|, If that player improves his |cp|4|at|^*B'trick taking ability'^*N|cp||at| as a declarer, I would guess he would improve his scores by 30%|pg||at| and if he and his partner greatly improved their |cp|4|at|^*B'trick taking ability'^*N|cp||at| on defense, I can foresee scores improving by ^*Banother^*N 50%.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Wow!!!! Those are significant numbers.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Here's another amazing fact Tiger.|pg||at| Becoming a terrific bidder ^*Bwill not^*N have any affect on your trick taking ability.|pg||at| On the other hand, improve your card playing skills and you will become a much better bidder.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2How does that work?|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Knowing |cp|4|at|^*B'how to play the cards'^*N|cp||at| will help you ^*Bevaluate^*N your assets as well as the combined assets of you and your partner so ultimately this will impact on your bidding skills.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2By the way, I saw you in the the audience at the BIL's |cp|4|at|^*BTHINK WITH FRED^*N|cp||at| session on Wednesday, August 25th. Did you enjoy it?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Yes it was immensely interesting and Fred did a great job.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2For the most part, what did he talk about?|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2From the start, he said he was going to talk mainly about |cp|4|at|^*B'counting'^*N|cp||at| and then if I recall properly, for the most part his comments were about who has what cards and what High Card Points.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2And what do you think the purpose of that was?|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Hum....let me think......|pg||at| .....hey, I think I finally got it..... to help him |cp|4|at|^*B'take as many tricks as possible'^*N|cp||at|.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Here's another thing talking about Fred. I know you downloaded the free software he created for the ACBL called |cp|4|at|^*BLearn to Play Bridge^*N|cp||at|.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Let's take another look at the hand Joe Beginner played.|pg||nt||bg||st||pn|Joe Beginner,West,North,East,South,West,North,East|md|2SJ97HJDAK654CK876,SAKT5H873DJ82CAJT,S63HAKT42DQT97CQ3,SQ842HQ965D3C9542|sv|n|sk|s|rh||ah|BIL|ah|Sample Hand|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|P|mb|?|pg||at|
^b @2Tiger, Even in bridge, there can be too much of a good thing.|pg||at| Joe Beginner missed the boat in his first attempt.|pg||at| 

Did you see his error before it came home to roost?|pg||nt||at|
^b @2It is one that you will make many times, a claim I make based on my own experiences.|pg||lb|*BHow should South respond to North's overcall?^^2n|nt||mb|p|an|Incorrect bid|at|
^b @2Pass is incorrect.|pg||at| 

It is easy to reject a pass. Less easy is deciding among the other bids.|pg||nt||ub|1|mb|2d|an|Incorrect bid|at|
2@D is possible.|pg||hs|sd|at| You have a good suit and you have a pretty good hand.|pg||at| However, 2@D is not forcing.|pg||at| When you bid a new suit in response to an overcall, you are not ordering partner to bid again.|pg||at| If you bid a new suit in response to an opening bid, it is forcing and the bidding will continue for sure.|pg||nt|
The reason that I don't bid 2@D is that the hand is four or five points stronger than partner will expect.|pg||at| I would bid 2@D with six diamonds to the @DAK and nothing else.|pg||at| This hand is much better than that.|pg||ls|sd|at| Also, the relatively balanced nature of the hand suggests I bid notrump.|pg||nt||ub|1|mb|1n|an|Incorrect bid|at|
1NT would also get some votes.|pg||hs|sc|at| It shows a club stopper and promises around eight to eleven points.|pg||ls|sc|at| 

The hand you have here has twelve points so for that reason 1NT is a little conservative.|pg||nt||ub|1|mb|2n|at|

2NT is the bid I like the most.|pg||at| It is not a beautiful bid, but none of the other choices is perfect either.|pg||nt||at|
^b @2In Zen philosophy there is a line that near perfection is more beautiful than perfection because it is attainable.|pg||at| We also probably relate to near-perfection better because we are all far from perfect.|pg||at| We understand. We get it.|pg||nt||at|
^b @2It is the nature of bidding that you will not always have an 'obvious' bid to make.|pg||at| 

2NT says you have twelve or thirteen points, give or take, and a stopper in the opponent's suit.|pg||nt| 

The hand does not have a true spade stopper and you would like to have two cards in partner's heart suit, but it does come close to being a 2NT bid.|pg||nt||mb|ppp|at|

Let's give Joe Beginner full marks for his bidding on the hand.|pg||nt||pc|skss8s|pg||pc|sssqs|tc|h|pg||nt|
This trick is good news for Joe.|pg||at| West might have started with three spades and East five.|pg||at| 

If so, 2NT would be down with five spade losers and the @CA.|pg||nt| 
West's @S5 suggests he is leading from a four card suit.|pg||at| 

^*BIF^*N the defenders can take just four spades and a club, 2NT will be makeable|pg||hs|sdnd|at| assuming diamonds run for five tricks.|pg||tc|r|ls|sdnd|nt||pc|sssah|pg||pc|shsc|pg||hs|shnh|pc|h8|at|
Finessing in hearts is dangerous. If it loses, Joe goes down.|pg||at| Is it worth the risk?|pg||at| 

I think not.|pg||ls|shnh|hc|ha|at| It is better to take the @HA|pg||lc|ha|hs|scnc|at| and set up a club trick to go with the other winners.|pg||ls|scnc|nt||pc|hah9h|pg||nt||ht|c|at|Are you happy with Joe's play so far?|pg||at| 

^*BYES

NO - IF YOU ANSWER NO, WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?^*N|pg||nt|
The answer is that Joe has made a serious error.|pg||hs|sdnd|at| All through the analysis, he has been counting on getting five diamond winners.|pg||hs|sdnd|at|

The problem here is one that ^*Bgood card players^*N have learned through many sad experiences to avoid.|pg||at| When you have a long suit to run, you must examine the spot cards (cards lower that the ten) to see if they are going to get in your way.|pg||at| If you spot the problem in time, you usually can find a way out of trouble.|pg||nt| 
But only if you see the problem before it arrives.|pg||at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Tiger, I would like to make some comments on some of the points but before I do that, let me tell you a true story.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Many years ago I was playing in a sectional tournament and between sessions, one of the kibitzers asked my partner, Earl, if he would be willing to teach him how to play bridge.|pg||at| Earl replied by asking him if he was willing to pay the price, to which the kibitzer inquired about Earl's fees.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Earl told him he had it all wrong as he was not talking about money and continued by saying, ^*I'If you want to become a sausage, you have to go through the grinder?|pg||at| If you want to reach your full potential as a bridge player, you have to be prepared to go through that grinder also.'^*N|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I guess it is like anything else in life as you have to be prepared to put the work in if you want to reap the rewards.|pg||nt||bg|2|ht|g|cp|1|at|^b @2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Right Tiger and in the case of bridge, once you know the basics of the game, most of the learning comes from having someone point out your mistakes.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2That can be a very humbling experience so that is why I said it was so important to get a ^*Bgood^*N reputable mentor or teacher, one who has ^*Byour^*N best interests at heart.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2You wanted to comment on some of the other points....|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2When working and learning in consort with a regular partner, you improve much more rapidly than on your own.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2That only stands to reason as you have someone to practice with and discuss things.|pg||nt||ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2To go with this Michael, I really like the features on BBO that you pointed out to me.|pg||at| I like being able to log or save all the hands we  play and then uploading them in a chat room for a discussion with you.|pg||at| That is similar to me video taping my golf swing and reviewing it, neat!!!|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Also, there is the Partnership Bidding Area which allows you to put constraints on the type of hands and a relatively new feature of putting in the opponents' bids.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Before we move on to another topic, as I said earlier, I think it is important to play with other players and better players from time to time. This is a social game, so have fun with others and do not confine all of your playing to your regular partner.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2WOW!!! This |cp|4|at|^*Bvisualization^*N|cp||at| thing really does work.|pg||nt||bt||bg|2|3d|5|ht|g|cp|4|at|^b @2^*BTIGER:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Those were two very interesting hands Michael showing that if you plan ahead and try to predict the play before it happens, you will have a better opportunity to take all the tricks that should be coming to you.|pg||cp|1|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2Yes Tiger, it reminds me a lot of things I have heard golf commentators praise you for and that is ^*I'good course management'^*n.|pg||at| In bridge, I like to talk about |cp|4|at|^*B'good hand management'^*N|cp||at|.|pg||cp|4|at|

^b@2^*BMICHAEL:^*N|cp||at|^e  @2I appreciate you taking the time to be with us today but before you go just let me take a moment or two to highlight some of the key points we talked about today.|pg||cp|4|at|

^d@C ^e@2Give some thought to the points I made in the list titled ^*BPLAY BETTER BRIDGE^*N.|pg||cp||at|

^d@C ^e@2Rather than being too caught up with conventions, concentrate more on learning skills that will make you better at |cp|4|at|^*BTAKING TRICKS^*N|cp||at| as a declarer and defender.|pg||cp||at|

^d@C ^e@2Try to |cp|4|at|^*Bvisualize^*N|cp||at| what is going to happen in the play before it happens.|pg||cp||at|

^d@C ^e@2Continue to work on your |cp|4|at|^*Bcounting^*N|cp||at| skills. |cp|4|at|^*BCount^*N|cp||at| high card points, |cp|4|at|^*Bcount^*N|cp||at| distribution and |cp|4|at|^*Bcount^*N|cp||at| tricks.|pg||cp||at|
