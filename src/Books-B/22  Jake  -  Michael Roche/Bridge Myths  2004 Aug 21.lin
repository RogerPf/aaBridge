My name is ^*BMichael^*N and my BBO User Name is ^*B'Jake'^*N. The BIL management team has asked me to do something primarily for their membership.  I am pleased to introduce this presentation format to you. There are many wonderful teachers donating their time and efforts by offering great free sessions in the lounge and hopefully this presentation style will compliment their efforts.|pg||at|

To give you some background, I have been teaching bridge for over 30 years. As well I have been a club owner/operator and a bridge director. Bridge is my full time occupation. I have a working agreement with Bridge Base Inc to use their software to make 'movies' (bridge animations) as used in this presentation. Some of my work has been used in commercial CD products. I thank you Fred for your cooperation in getting this presention off the ground. I also wish to thank the BIL management team for all they have done in putting this project together.|pg||nt||ht|h|at|^b @2During the presentation, you will not be able to comment or ask questions but at the end, the floor will be open for a discussion. You can email me anytime regarding this presentation, lessons or 'movies':|cs|3|at|

^b@2Here is the auction.|pg||at|

I see we have Beginners/Intermediate Lounge members sitting at the table.|pg||nt||pc|sk|

^b@2The opening lead by West is the @SK.|pg||at|

Now you can take a minute and decide how you might play this hand.|pg||nt||pc|ss8s|at|^b@2
West wins the trick with the @SK|tc|h|pg||tc|r|pc|sasss|at|, cashes the @SA|tc|h|pg||tc|r|pc|sssh|at| and leads a third spade which South ruffs.|tc|h|pg||tc|r|nt||hs|sdnd|at|^b@2

South sees that he has two diamond losers to take care of|pg||at| and that his best shot by far is to try to ruff them in dummy.|pg||nt||ls|sdnd|at|
^b@2South, therefore, cashes the @DK|pc|dddkd|tc|h|pg||tc|r|at| and the @DA.|pc|dddad|tc|h|pg||tc|r|nt|^b@2
Declarer then leads a third diamond|hc|d6|pg||at| to ruff in dummy with the @H9.|lc|d6|hc|h9|pc|d6|pg||nt||lc|h9|nt||pc|ddhhj|tc|h|pg||nt||bg|4|fp|3|at|
^-OOPS!|pg||nt||

THAT WAS NOT IN THE PLAN!|pg||nt||bg||at|
^b@2East overruffed with the @HJ|pg||tc|r|at| and returned a trump.|pc|hhhh|pg||nt|^b@2

South later lost another diamond trick|hc|dj|pg||at| to go ^*BDOWN ONE^*N.|pg||lc|dj|nt||cs|1|ht|d|at|
^-{

Declarer was ^*Iunlucky^*N to go down on this line of play, since East had to hold|pg||at| a doubleton diamond|pg||at| as well as the @HJ for this approach to fail.|pg||at|

Nevertheless, the outcome was ^*BSouth's own fault^*N.|pg||up|8|nt|^b @2
Let's go back two tricks.|pg||hs|sdnh|at| Declarer was right to try to ruff two diamonds in dummy|pg||at|, but to make sure nothing went awry|pg||ls|sdnh|at|, she should have ruffed the third diamond with the @HK|hc|d6hk|pg||lc|hk|hc|h9|at| not the @H9!|pg||lc|h9|nt||pc|ddhkc|at|
^b @2This play would have guaranteed the contract.|tc|h|pg||tc|r|nt|
^b @2Declarer can now cash the @CA and|pc|caccc|tc|h|pg||tc|r|at| return to her hand by ruffing a club.|pc|cckhc|pg||nt|
^b @2She can now lead the @DJ and ruff with dummy's @H9.|hc|djh9|pg||lc|djh9|nt||pc|ddqhhj|tc|h|at|
^b @2Though East overruffed|pg||at|, declarer has ten tricks in the till...|pg||tc|r|up|36|sk||lc|d6hk|at| two diamonds|hc|dak|pg||at|, one club|lc|dak|hc|ca|pg||at|, a spade ruff|lc|ca|hc|s9h4|pg||at|, a club ruff|lc|s9h4|hc|c3h7|pg||at|, a diamond ruff|lc|c3h7|hc|d6hk|pg||at| and four trump tricks.|lc|d6hk|hc|haqt8|pg||at|

^b @2West's opening lead is the @D3 against 3NT reached on the above auction.|pg||at|

On this hand, we will observe from a defender's point of view.|pg||nt| ^b @2
As defenders we should should be thinking in terms of 'making a contract'. Our 'contract' on this hand is to take five tricks to beat the hand."|pg||lc|d3|nt||pc|d3ddad|at|
^bEast wins the first trick with the @DA|tc|h|pg||tc|r|at| and continues with the @DQ|pc|d|pg||pc|ddd|tc|h|pg||at| which also wins.|pg||tc|r|nt|
^bThen, having run out of diamonds|pg||at|, East shifts to a heart.|pc|h3|pg||nt||pc|hahh|at|
^bSouth wins this trick with the @HA|tc|h|pg||tc|r|hs|nc|at| and leads a club to force out the @CA.|pc|cj|pg||ls|nc|nt||pc|cacc|tc|h|pg||nt|
^b@2West wins this trick|pg||tc|r|at| cashes the @DK|hc|dk|pg||lc|dk|pc|dkhcd|pg||at| and notices the wry grin on South's face|sb|s    ((-*_*-))|pg||at| and senses the sickly feeling in his stomach.|pg||nt||sb|wuggh! Where's the 'Bud Light' when needed?|pg||nt||sb|s|sb|w|sk|s|at|
^b@2South puts West out of his misery by showing his hand|mc|9|at|, claiming that he has the rest of the tricks with|pg||at| four club tricks|hs|ncsc|pg||ls|ncsc|at|, two heart tricks|hs|nhsh|pg||ls|nhsh|at| and three spade tricks.|hs|ssns|pg||nt||ls|ssns|sb|wSorry partner,    my fault.|pg||sb|w|sb|eWhat happened?|pg||nt||sb|e|cs|1|ht|d|at|

Here is the whole hand.|up|20|sk||pg||at|

Let's replay the hand with all fifty-two cards in view.|pg||nt||pc|d3ddad|pg||pc|dd|pg||at|
^b @2Allowing East to win this second trick with the @DQ seems the normal thing to do|pg||at|, but West should notice his good diamond spots|hs|wd|pg||at|, especially seeing the @D10 in dummy|hs|nd|pg||at| and recalling that dummy played the @D9 on the first trick.|pg||nt|
^b @2West realizes that he should overtake his partner's @DQ with his @DK|ls|wdnd|pc|dkd|tc|h|pg||tc|r|at| and lead his @D8|hc|d8|pg||at| to force out the @DJ.|hc|dj|pg||lc|dj8|pc|d8hcdj|tc|h|pg||tc|r|up|12|hs|wded|nt|
^b @2If West does this, the defense eventually scores four diamond tricks|pg||sb|eWell done pard! Nice overtake.|at| and a club trick.|ls|wded|hs|wcec|pg||at|

^*BDOWN ONE!^*N|pg||sb|e|ls|wcec|nt||nt||sb|e|cs|1|ht|d|at|
^-{
     ^*BPOST MORTEM....continued....^*N      
}|pg||
nt||at|
^b @2There is no good reason|pg||at|, ^*Bexcept carelessness^*N|pg||at|, for West's failure to overtake the@DQ.|pg||at| True, East might have the @DAQx and overtaking would cost West a trick|pg||at|, but it could not cost him the contract.|pg||nt|
^b @2For practical purposes|pg||at|, West can feel certain that three notrump will be defeated ^*Bif^*N he overtakes the @DQ|pg||at|, and that the contract will probably be made if he ducks the @DQ.|pg||at| 

That is certainly enough reason for overtaking.|pg||nt|
^b @2^*BBUT^*N|pg||at|, of course|pg||at|, West must have his mind on the game at trick two|pg||at| and not allow himself to fall into the trap of following low ^*Bmechanically^*N.|pg||nt|
^b @2I envision this ^*Ipossible^*N scenario on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N after the play went as in the first take of this hand.|pg||at|

After trick five, South claims the rest of the tricks for a total of nine tricks, ^*Bmaking 3NT^*N.|pg||nt|
^b @2Before starting the next hand, East-West press the ^*IMOVIE^*N button and look over the scores.|pg||at| 

They notice that the hand was played six times previously.|pg||nt|^b @2
Five times the result was the same as at their table... 3NT making three|pg||at| for +600 to North-South.|pg||at|

At the sixth table, the result was 3NT down one|pg||at| for +100 to East-West.|pg||nt|^-

Maybe the banter might go something like this.|pg||nt||sb|wThe time 3NT went down...|pg||sb|w|sb|w...declarer must have made a mistake.|pg||sb|eI bet I know what it was....|sb|w|pg||sb|e...it was probably "you know who..."|pg||sb|e...Fred and Sherri sitting East-West...|pg||sb|e..I hear they play in the BIL as intermediates!|pg||sb|e....using phoney names....|pg||sb|wThey played together for a long time you know.|sb|e|pg||sb|eFred and his partner Brad, won the Cavendish...|sb|w|pg||sb|wThey know all the tricks... You know what I mean.|sb|e|pg||sb|e"Smoke and mirrors" I think!|sb|w|pg||sb|e|sb|wOh well!...maybe...|pg||sb|w|sb|w...someone'll make 4NT and we will get an average.|pg||at|
^b @2East-West go on to the next hand thinking they are ^*Bunlucky^*N and may get a tie for bottom|sb|w|pg||at| 

and Fred and Sherri get a top because of their ^*Bknowledge and skill^*N.|pg||nt||
fp|1|cp|4|ht|l|at|^-Nothing could be further from the truth.|pg||nt|
^b @2Really a tie with five other pairs|pg||at| for two and a half matchpoints on the hand|pg||at| is ^*BBETTER^*N than they deserve.|pg||at|

What they deserve is...|pg||nt||bg|1|fp|3|at|
^-A BIG FAT ZERO!|pg||bg||fp||nt|
^b @2...but they probably don't even realize it|pg||at| and consider themselves unlucky that Fred and Sherri were sitting East-West also.|pg||at|

If Fred and Sherri were North-South|pg||at|, East-West's -600 on the hand may have ^*Btied for top^*N.|pg||nt||
fp|1|cp|4|ht|l|at|^-....and the MYTH is perpetuated.|pg||nt|^b @2

|fp||ht|h|fp|3|at|^-Voila!

|fp||ht|l|at|^b @2With the singleton @SK coming down offside, you are rewarded for your work.|pg||at|

What Tas did here was ^*Bthink^*N.|pg||at| He thought about the bidding and realized that East could not have more than the @HA.|pg||at|

There is a name for what Tas did here.|pg||at| It is called|cp|4|at| ^*BLocating Your Opponents' High Cards^*N|cp||at|.|pg||at|

I believe that of all the things you can learn, this is more important than any other aspect of dummy play.|pg||fp|2|at|

|fp||at|^b@2I sense that I may have a difficult time convincing some of you.|pg||at| If some one had said the same thing to me|pg||at|, when I was a Beginner/Intermediate|pg||at|, I probably would have been hard to convince also!|pg||at|

Years of experience and a greater appreciation of what this game is all about have taught me differently.|pg||at|

Let's delve into some of the reasons for ^*B'thinking'^*N that it is a difficult game.|pg||nt||ht|c|at|^b@2 Perhaps you have been told that in order to play this game you have to have the mind of...|pg||at|

Albert Einstein|pg||at|

or Bill Gates|pg||at|

or Groucho Marx|pg||at|

or Isaac Newton|pg||at|

Not true!|pg||at|

In fact, look who has become not too shabby at this game!|pg||at|

Fred Gitelman|pg||at|


The point (other than the joke about Fred) is that you ^*Bdo not^*N have to be a genius to play this game well.|pg||at| 

This is not a game ONLY for the super intelligent people.|pg||bm||nt||ht|c|at|^b @2Think about it in these terms:|pg||at|

There are only 52 cards in the deck.|pg||at|

There are only 4 suits.|pg||at| ...and to make it easier for us, 2 of them are black and 2 of them are red!|pg||at|

There are only 13 cards in each suit.|pg||at| ...and to make it easier for us, all the cards in each suit have the same 13 designations and ranking.|pg||at|

To make it even easier for us, the higher ranking cards in each suit all have pictures.|pg||at|

We don't have to play by ourselves, we even have a partner to help us.|pg||at|

We only have to count to 13.|pg||at| You must admit we do not have to be Einstein to do that.|pg||at|

We only have to remember the cards until the hand is over, normally a few minutes.|pg||at| Don't have to be Newton or Gitelman to do that.|pg||at|

If it is so mentally tough that you have to be Einstein or Newton or Gitelman to play it well|pg||at|

... then why are there millions of people around the world getting great enjoyment from the game?|pg||nt||ht|b|at|^b @2So why do ^*Bwe think^*N it is difficult?|pg||at|

Allow me to suggest the following:|pg||at|

So often, ^*Bbefore^*N we even start to learn the game|pg||at| we are told by others that this is a difficult game...|pg||at| and the sad part is we often ^*Bbelieve^*N them|pg||at| so before we even start we form this preconceived notion in our minds.|pg||at| What are our chances of somewhat mastering this game with that initial attitude?|pg||at|... not to say anything about how much fun this will be!|pg||at|

Folks, approach this fun pastime with an open mind and enjoy it.|pg||at|

Also, once we get introduced to the game|pg||at|, friends|pg||at|, partners|pg||at|, opponents|pg||at|, teachers|pg||at| and everyone else (maybe even your favorite taxi driver)|pg||at| start firing a gazillion rules, percentages and conventions at us...|pg||at| and to compound the situation|pg||at|, much of the information that we are being flooded with is conflicting|pg||at| and we don't know who to believe.|pg||at|

The first thing we know, we are asking ourselves|pg||at|, ^*B"If this is supposed to be fun, why does my head hurt?"^*N|pg||at|

In my opinion, it is a ^*Bfun^*N game|pg||at| and it should be for you also|pg||at| ...not one that requires headache medication at the end of a session.|pg||at| As I said at the start of this myth, bridge is not difficult, it is simple! |pg||at| 

Well let me concede that it is challenging!|pg||tu|Y|nt||ht|e|at|^b @2

If these Lecture Hall presentations are to continue, in the next one, I would like to give you my ideas on how to go about learning and enjoying this wonderful game without the need for medication.|pg||at|

With the changes planned for BBO, we are hoping to greatly enhance presentations of this nature with technological changes allowing the use of graphics and other goodies.|pg||at|

Thank you all for attending.  Thanks to BBO, thanks to BIL management and thanks to those BIL members who allowed me to use their names in the hands presented.|pg||at|

 As this is the first of what may be an ongoing series, we would appreciate any comments, positive or negative. Now we will open a chat room (hosted by BIL Manager) for questions and comments! All questions may not be answered but the chat will be logged and addressed in a future BIL Newsletter.|pg||nt||ht|e|at|^b @2
