^-{ ^*bTake Out Doubles 2: How to respond (advance)^*n }
^-|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


at|
When partner makes a take out double he shows one of three types of hand:|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


cs|2|
at|

{ ^*b1) A shapely hand of around opening strength upwards which can play in one of three suits, while short in the suit doubled.^*n } |
cs|2|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|

{ ^*b2) A strong hand which is too good for a direct overcall - somewhere around 8 playing tricks (PT).^*n }|
cs|2|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|

{ ^*B3) A balanced hand which is too strong to make a 1NT overcall (more than 17 points).^*n} |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

Let's consider the sequence :|
ia|1dxp?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

When responding to partner's take out double you should try to be as descriptive as possible; imagine partner has around 14 points and good support. You have several options, which I'll deal with in turn. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |

^*b1. PASS.^*n Sometimes this is the least of evils, but other times it's a positive decision to take a penalty. |

With ^*bhands 11^*n and ^*b12^*n you have a clear pass of the double of 1@d. Even with ^*bhand 13^*n this is the best action with only three points.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at| 

Pass with hands that have solid trumps. The pass is an instruction for partner to lead a trump so that you can draw declarer's trumps before he can get ruffs with them. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

^*bHand 14^*n is not suitable for pass because the trumps are not solid and should bid 1NT (6-9 points).|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|
^*b2. 1NT.(Hand 14)^*n This promises a single diamond stop, no four card major and scattered values, 6-9 points. Some people play this as a weak bid showing nothing. It is much better used to show a few values and a diamond stop.|st||

3. ^*b2NT^*n and ^*b3NT^*n. These are natural and tend to deny a four card major. 2NT should be around 10-12 points and 3NT showing 13-15. 

Both bids show a good stop in diamonds; often a double stop in the case of 3NT.|

^*b4. New suit at the lowest level^*N. This should be quite wide ranging and show around 0-7 points as you will be forced to bid with some very poor hands. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|

Normally bid your cheapest 4 card suit, but with a major and a minor, prefer the major. Sometimes you will have hand which have no suitable four card suit and then just bid your cheapest 3 card suit. |

^*bHands 20^*n and ^*b21^*n are approaching maximum 1@s bids. (Note that I am not counting full value for the J in the opponents suit) |

^*b6.Cue bid the opponent's suit.^*n This is normally used to show a hand too good to bid a suit immediately and should be game forcing showing more than 12 points. Doubler can have one of three hand types, so we need to investigate fully if we have slam on. |

Often a good hand with four cards in both majors makes a cue bid. A minimum hand would be something like this.|

Bid 2@d so that you can reach the best contract when partner has these hands:|

The cue bid is also the first move when you have a slam try opposite partner's take out double. For example:|

^*bHand 29^*n makes a cue bid and then rebids spades at the lowest level to show a slam try in spades. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |

^*bNote that in each case we try to be as descriptive as possible to help partner out. ^*n|

A quick word about what to do if third hand bids something rather than passing. After a redouble, for example, you are released from bidding but should try to help partner by bidding a 5 card suit when you have one. If RHO bids a suit, then you can bid in the same way as before, but you need some values to enter the auction. |

mb|1dxp?|
lb|*bPartner has doubled 1D,RHO passes. What do you bid?^^2c^|nt|

p). 2@c is the most descriptive bid available. Bidding 1NT might work well at pairs. If you held J@d, this would suggest bidding 1NT more strongly.
