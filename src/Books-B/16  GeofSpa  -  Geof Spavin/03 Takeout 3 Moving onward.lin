^-{ ^*bTake Out Doubles 3: Doubler's rebid. ^*n }
^-
|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


at|This time a few ideas about how to continue after a take out double and an idea about how far to raise partner's suit.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|

It's right to make a take out double when you hold one of three hand types; shortage with good support, strong balanced, and strong unbalanced. Following a takeout double you need to show which type of hand we have. |

^*bFirst, let's look at what to do when you have a shapely unbalanced hand with support for three suits.^*n|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |

Consider these two auctions:

In the first auction, if you as the doubler have spade support, you need to know how high to raise your partner's spades. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

The answer to this problem is to bid as though you have opened 1@d and partner has responded 1@s, as in the second auction.|

Here are some examples of how far to raise.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |

mb|1cxp1sp?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|

^*bHand 30^*n @2is a minimum take out double with only three spades and should pass over 1@s.
remember here partner may be forced to bid with 0 HCP
@4|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||pn|Hand 31|
md|4hsak63hkt73dq983cj|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|
^*bHand 31^*n @2is a minimum take out double with four spades. Show this by bidding 2@s. This promises no extra values, just four spades.
@4|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||pn|Hand 32|
md|4hsakj5hkq73dkt92c5|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|
^*bHand 32^*n @2is a very sound take out double. If partner had bid 1@s over 1@d, then a raise to 3@s would be about right. Just bid the same way. Bid 3@S.
@4|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||pn|Hand 33|
md|4hsakj9haqj6dkjt3c3|

pg| ***** 14 ***** |

^*bHand 33^*n is a very fine hand. Show this by bidding 4@s.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|
In summary, when you have support, raise partner's suit as though you had opened 1 of a minor. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

Should partner bid no trumps, then you can raise him as you know how strong his hand is. Bid game or invite depending on your combined values. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |

^*bHow do you show a hand too good to overcall in a suit or one no trump?^*n|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|

This is very simple. 

Double and then a new suit shows about eight playing tricks. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|

Double and then rebidding no trumps at the lowest level shows 18-20 points. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

Double and then jumping shows more. |

2NT - Shows a balanced hand with 21-23 points.|

2@c - Game forcing. This cue bid shows a very strong hand.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

2@d/ 2@H - This shows a minimum of 8 playing tricks in diamonds/hearts. Forcing for one round.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|

3@d/ 3@h - These are rather uncommon and should show a hand with about 10 playing tricks and good shape. Game forcing.|

That's really all there is to it.|

^-^*bNow for a few problems with which you can interact.^*n

md|4hsK974hQJ6dAQ763c3|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^2s^|at|

q) Bid 2@s. Show you have four card support for spades, but no extras, by raising spades. Partner should expect no more. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |

md|4hsQJt84hKQ84dAJ96|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^3s^|nt|
r) This is going to play very well in spades despite you minimum values. Bid 3@s to invite game. Partner will bid with a few bits and bobs. Bidding 4@s initially could work, but this will be hard work if partner has nothing.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


pn|Problem s)|
md|4sAKJhJ85dQJ98cAQt|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^1n^|nt|
s) A hand too good for an initial 1NT overcall (15-17) is shown by doubling and then rebidding 1NT. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


pn|Problem t)|
md|4sAKQ6hAQJ8dAJt5c7|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^4s^|nt|
t) . This is about as good as it ever gets (Never in my hands though) You must bid at least 4@s. Perhaps bidding 4@c, a splinter agreeing spades, is better.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


pn|Problem u)|
md|4sK94hJdAKQ952cAK7|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^2d^|nt|

u) 2@d. Showing a hand with at least 8 playing tricks in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


pn|Problem v) |
md|4sAQ6hAt98dKJ972ct| 
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^p^|nt|

v)  Pass. You've found a spade fit, but there's nothing else to show as you do not have a fourth spade. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


pn|Problem w)|
md|4sKQt4hKQJ4dAQJ3c8|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^4s^|nt|
w) It looks like you have four losers in spades. Surely partner can mop up one of those. Bid just as though partner had responded 1@s to your 1@d opener. Bidding 4@s is the practical shot.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


pn|Problem x)|
md|4saqthkqtdaq4ckqt9|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^2n^|nt|
x) Bid 2NT to show a balanced hand with 21-23 points. It would be right to show the balanced shape even if you had four spades instead of four clubs. Partner could have a bust with three spades.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


pn|Problem y)|
md|4sthKQJ9875dAQcAK7|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bWhat will you bid after your initial take out double?^^3h^|nt|
y) To show around ten playing tricks with a self sufficient suit bid 3@h, forcing to game. This invites partner to cue bid a control. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


pn|Problem z)|
md|4sAhKJ98dKQJ6cJ985|
mb|1cxp1sp?|
lb|*bRHO opens 1H at love all what do you bid?^^?^|nt|
z) What did you answer? There is no right answer here as you do not have a rebid. This hand was not suitable for a takeout double of 1@c as it has no support for spades. Pass is best with this hand instead of the initial take out double. As I have been told many many times "passing the first time round is not giving up"|

^-This is the end of this presentation on Takeout Doubles
^-
What I have presented here is just the beginning of doubles for takeout, I could continue with more but time prevents me at the moment.

I am going to stay around for a little while so if there are any further questions on what has been covered here I will gladly answer or if it is beyond my knowledge I  will endeavour to find the answer in the next couple of days and get back to you.

I hope you have learnt a little more and that now your doubles will now convey greater meaning to your partner
