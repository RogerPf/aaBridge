It would be nice to be able to play in a part score in Hearts right?|

BUT ... You can't make a bid; as partner will not be able to stop short of game.|

^-The answer of course is to play  ^*bLebensohl^*n. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

We use Lebensohl to show weak hands, invitational hands or strong hands.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |

^-The simple basic explanation of the system is this: -
^-
^*iOver 1NT from partner and interference from the opps, a bid of 2NT is a demand for partner to bid 3@c. This you will now pass (if your 5-card suit is clubs), or bid your suit which partner MUST pass.^*n|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |

Now having grasped the basics, let us go through exactly what the convention is. Do not feel tempted to rush through this, without fully understanding each step as you go. |

How can he tell this? |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

For the simple reason that with a weak hand you would have bid 2@d, 2@h, or 2@s.

It is logical, right?|

Exactly the same applies here. A bid of 2NT, followed by 3@c, and then 3@h/@s by you is invitational.|

Study these different sequences. It is important to understand them, if you want to use the system to its full advantage.|

This is Stayman showing a Heart guard. 
It is necessary to go on this long route in order to let partner know that you have a Heart guard. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |

{|ia|,1n2h2np3cp3n|at|}

This is to play showing a Heart guard(s) and denying 4  Spades.

You can also use Lebensohl over weak 2's. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|

2@s is opened on your left, and partner doubles for take out.

You have a 4-card Heart suit

If you have 10 points, you of course will bid game.

However if you hold anything between zero and 9 points what can you bid? |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|

Without lebensohl there is just one bid available, which is 3@h. Partner will not know how good or bad you are within this range, and will have to make a guess as to whether to go on holding 17 points or better.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|

Using Lebensohl we can narrow the range by using the 2NT bid, to show 6 points or less. You bid 2NT, and over his bid of 3@c, you sign off with 3@h.

^-^*bHe will now be warned that your hand has under 6 points.^*N |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|
^-
A direct bid of 3@h will now show between 6 and 10 points. |0
