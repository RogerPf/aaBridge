sk|e|mb|2s|at| and East overcalled 2@S|pg||
sk|s|mb|p|at| followed by pass|pg||
sk|w|at| and I found myself in the hot seat - should I pass 2@S or bid 3@S?|pg||
at| In principle when one opponent opens a preempt and partner overcalls - the advancer is expected to have 7-8 points. And this is what I had: minimum points (8), 4333 shape. However, all the points were "working " points - @DA, @HK and even the @SJ - so I bid 3@s|mb|3s|pg||
sk||mb|ppp|at| which my partner rightly passed.|pg||

sv|n|pf||sk|e|nt|I recommend opening with 11 points and a 6 suiter.|mb|1s|pg||
sk|s|at| It would be wrong to overcall 2@C as a 2 level overcall promises a much better hand and suit.|mb|p|pg||
sk|w|at| The bidding should continue with 2@H...|mb|2h|pg||

sk|s|mb|p|pg||
sk|w|at| West invites game...|mb|3D|pg||
sk|n|mb|p|pg||
sk|e|at| and East can try 3NT.|mb|3n|pg||
sk||mb|ppp|pc|c6|nt|On the normal club lead declarer can't make the contract - so maybe it should have been better to pass as dealer and not listen to my recommandations :).|pg||
up|1|ub|12|nt|If dealer passed it should go like this.|mb|p1c1hp1sp2dp2sp|pg||
at| There I no need to be worried to pass 2@S with singleton - the alternative of bidding 2NT without a club stopper is much worse.|mb|pp|pg||
at|
And some little thing for the defense: when we lead partner's suit we should lead low from 3 if the suit was not supported, giving the count.|pg||

ub|1|mb|4np5hp6sppp|
nt|I was asked about the lead - and of course it depends on how the bidding went. I would not lead the singleton trump as sometimes that may give away a trick. Leading a club may work well in case partner has the @CQ and a side trick so that would have been my choice. The alternative would be the @d10 - passive lead :).|pg||

rh||ah|Board 04|ah|Partscore|ah|battle|
sv|b|pf||sk||mb|p|nt|The first question is either to open the North hand or to pass: ten points, nice shape...|pg||
sk|n|at| I would suggest Pass as we are not well placed if partner responds 1@S. If the hearts were spades I might have considered opening. As it is, we may have a chance to get into the bidding later showing the shape and lack of points.|mb|p|pg||
ub|1|mb|1c1s|sk|e|nt|If North opens 1@C, East does well to bid 1@S as his hand is not strong enough for a double first and later suit bid because of the @CQ. As a general policy: Queens and Jacks in suits bid by opponents should not be counted unless partner bids NT.|pg||
sk|s|at| South can bid 1NT now...|mb|1n|pg||
sk|w|at| and West should support spades.|mb|2s|pg||
sk|n|at| Now North's hand should make a takeout double as there must be a fit for their side too.|mb|x|pg||
sk||nt|It's very hard for the E-W pair to stop in 2@s which is the limit for the hand. So this hand should be a partscore battle with N-S making 3@d or 4@d and E-W competing to 3@S.
Q: At our table it went p - p -1@S - p - 4@S - 4NT - p - 5@D - p - p - Dbl
A: I think 4@S is a bit misguided with such a balanced hand. And North should double to show 3 suits. 4NT is a 2-suiter, usually minors.|pg||

The 4441 hand should be able to see that 3 Aces may be enough for a grand
Q: I thought  splinter had  to be Double jump?
