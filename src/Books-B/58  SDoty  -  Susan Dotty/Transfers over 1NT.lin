^B@2^Z@3Today I'll be covering Jacoby Transfers over 1NT, and if there is time at the end I'll also give a @e@3 brief introduction to Texas Transfers. You can find an overview of Jacoby and Texas Transfers. They are under the section on Notrump Bidding on my website: ^*Hwww.BridgeClasses.com/notes/^*N. |pg||fp|2|at|
^-@D@D@D Jacoby Transfers over 1NT @D@D@D
^-
In all of today's hands, I'll be using a 15-17 HCP 1NT range. SOUTH will be the dealer and 1NT opening bidder in all of the hands. NORTH will be the responder.|PG||AT|

When our partner opens the bidding with 1NT, he gives us a fairly precise picture of his hand: 15-17 HCP and balanced distribution. 
^CThat means no singleton or void, and (typically) no more than one doubleton.
^CThe balanced hand patterns are: 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, and 5-3-3-2|pg||at|

Knowing so much about opener's hand, it's responder's job to try and answer two key questions:
^C1) How high should we play? Part-score? game? (maybe even a slam?)
^C2) What strain should we play in... that is to say, in which suit or no trump?|pg||at|

Responder can use some simple addition to address the first question-how high.
Opposite a 15-17 HCP 1NT opener, the usual ranges for responder are:
^C0-7 points = Sign off in a part-score
^C8-9 points = Invite game
^C10-14 points = Force to game|pg||at|  

As far as which strain to play in-a suit or no trump-Jacoby Transfers really help us out. If the partnership has an 8+ card major suit fit, then that's typically where you want to play.
@D@D If responder has a 6+ card major suit, then he KNOWS the partnership has an 8+ card fit-since partner must have at least a doubleton for his 1NT opening bid. @D@D|pg||

^B@2^Z@3Therefore, with a 6+ card major, responder can confidently insist on playing with his major suit @e@3 as trump. With only a 5 card major suit, things aren't quite so clear cut.|PG||AT| If responder has a 5 card major, the partnership is not guaranteed an 8 card fit. It is possible that opener only has a doubleton. Therefore, if responder has a 5 card major and is going to invite or force to game, he needs to get more input from partner in order to find out whether they have a 5-3 or 5-4 fit, or only a 5-2 (in which case they'd rather play in no trump instead.) |pg||at|

Now that we have a rough idea of some of the issues/questions the partnership has to deal with in these no trump auctions, the best way to get a real feel for what's going on is to go through examples... so that's what we'll do in a few minutes. There are only two bids at the core of Jacoby Transfers over 1NT:|pg||at|

^C2@D = Transfer to 2@H
^C2@H = Transfer to 2@S|pg||at|

Responder's 2@D bid does two things. 
First, it says a LITTLE bit about responder's hand that he has at least a 5 card heart suit. Can he have more than 5 hearts?|pg||at|   Yes. |pg||at|  Does it say anything about his strength?|pg||at|  No... he could have zero points, he could have 17+, or anything in between. It just says that he has at least five hearts in his hand.|pg||at|

Second, it asks opener to bid 2@H. Occasionally (if opener has a good hand with a strong fit (4+) for responder's major) opener might make a different bid (those are called Super Accepts.) But the vast majority of the time, opener is going to bid 2 of responder's shown major, like he was asked to.|pg||at|

Opener's  bid  doesn't say much of anything about his hand. He is just doing what responder asked him to. He could have 2, 3 or 4 of the asked major, and be anywhere in his 15-17 1NT range.|pg||

^B@2^Z@3This is not a descriptive bid by opener.... he's just doing as he was told, and leaving responder @e@3 the  maximum amount of room to do whatever he was planning on doing. Once responder has made a Jacoby Transfer (which establishes that he has a 5+ card major, but doesn't say anything else about his hand) it's his second bid that goes a long way in describing the rest of his hand. Responder's options depend on his strength-whether he wants to sign off in a part score, invite game, or force to game.|pg||at|

Here is a brief overview of responder's basic options and we'll be looking at examples of each.|pg||at|

WEAK (0-7) with a 5+ card major:|pg||cp|8|at|
^C•Jacoby Transfer then PASS.|pg||cp||at|

INVITATIONAL (8-9)|pg||cp|8|at|
^C• with exactly a 5 card major: Transfer then rebid 2NT
^C• with a 6+ card major: Transfer then raise to 3 of the major |pg||cp||at|

GAME FORCING (10-14)|pg||cp|8|at|
^C• with exactly a 5 card major: Transfer then rebid 3NT (or bid a new 4+ card suit 
        if unbalanced)
^C• with a 6+ card major: insist on game in the major.|pg||cp||at|

Now, letus look at a few examples. To get the description of  bids please roll your cursor over each. Further, in the text area I will give your more information.|pg||nt||

^B@2^Z@3In our first example, responder has a Weak hand. With 7 or fewer points, responder knows that the partnership doesn't have the combined strength for game so his job is to stop the bidding in a part score. Responder's hand rates to be more valuable if his long suit is trump than it would be in a no trump contract so he makes a Jacoby Transfer to his major, and then passes.|pg||pc|CA|mc|9|pg||

qx|o2|pn|sdoty,sdoty,sdoty,sdoty|st||md|1S83HAQ2DKQ8CAJT65,SAJ9HJT97D43CK732,SKQ752H54D9762C94,ST64HK863DAJT5CQ8,|rh||ah|Board 2|mb|1N|an|15-17 HCP balanced|mb|p|mb|2H|an|Transfer: 5+!S, any strength|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|an|Weak (0-7)|mb|p|nt|
^B@2^Z@3Responder's 2@H bid is a Jacoby Transfer to 2@S. It says that he has at least 5 spades in his hand (but says nothing about his strength), and asks opener to bid 2@S
^-** Note that opener bids 2@S as he was told to, even though he only has a doubleton **
^-This is EXTREMELY important.  As opener, you do NOT get to ignore partner's transfer just because you don't like his suit. Responder is the one in charge at this point-he knows a lot about opener's hand, and opener knows very little about his.|pg||nt|
^B@2^Z@3 As this example shows, when responder has a Weak hand (0-7) with only a 5 card major, he isn't guaranteed an 8 card trump fit.  When he transfers he is hoping that opener has at least 3 card support (which he will the majority of the time), but once in a while you will find yourself in a 5-2 fit. That's just the way it is... responder has to take the action that will work out best the majority of the time. |pg||nt|
^B@2^Z@3 It's important for responder to transfer to his major suit when he has a hand like this one, because his hand will usually be more valuable in a trump contract than in no trump. If spades are trump, responder's hand is going to contribute at least 2-3 spade tricks.  But imagine if NS played in 1NT instead... North's hand would only be worth ONE trick.|pg||nt|
^B@2^Z@3 South, with only two spades in his hand, would never be able to both establish and then cash out North's spade suit. He would get completely cut off from the dummy and responder's spades would hardly contribute anything at all. At least with spades as trump-even if the partnership only has a 5-2 fit-north's long spades are going to be worth some tricks. And if opener does have 3+ spades (which he will most of the time) we would certainly want to play in a spade contract.|pg||nt|
^B@2^Z@3 So in the long run, you're better off playing these hands in 2 of responder's major. Will there be hands that would have been better played in 1NT? Yes... but only a small percentage of them. With a Weak (0-7) hand responder has to make a choice-pass or transfer to his 5+ card major suit-and transferring will work out best the large majority of the time.|pg||pc|HJ|mc|9|pg||nt||

qx|o3|pn|sdoty,sdoty,sdoty,sdoty|st||md|1SAQHJ965DK862CKQ8,S983HAT83DQJT4CT6,SJ76542H42DA9C972,SKTHKQ7D753CAJ543,|rh||ah|Board 3|mb|1N|an|15-17 HCP balanced|mb|p|mb|2H|an|Transfer: 5+!S, any strength|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|an|Weak (0-7)|mb|p|nt|
^B@2^Z@3Again, responder has a Weak (0-7) hand that doesn't have any game interest, so he makes a Jacoby Transfer to his 5+ card major (this time he's lucky enough to have a 6 card spade suit) and then  passes. And not to beat a dead horse, but again note that opener COMPLETES THE TRANSFER by bidding 2@S, even though he only has a doubleton spade in his hand. Opener does not get to bid anything other than 2@S simply because he doesn't particularly like partner's spade suit. RESPONDER is the one in charge at this point, not opener.|pg||nt|	
^B@2^Z@3So far, we've seen that with a Weak hand (0-7) and a 5+ card major suit, responder transfers to his major and then passes. His goal there is simply to put the partnership in the best part score, and 2 of responder's major will usually play better than 1NT. That isn't guaranteed, but all we can do is go with the action that will turn out best the most often. With an Invitational strength hand (8-9 points), responder is strong enough to take two bids.|pg||pc|DQ|mc|9|pg||nt||

Responder starts by bidding 2@D ... a Jacoby Transfer to 2@H, telling partner that he has at least five hearts and asking him to bid 2@H. Responder's SECOND BID here is critical. With invitational strength (8-9), responder has to do one of two things after his transfer:|PG||cp|8|at|
^c* rebid 2NT with exactly a 5 card suit
^C* raise to 3 of his major with a 6+ card suit.|pg||CP||nt|
^B@2^Z@3 Responder's 2NT rebid here says: "Partner, I have invitational strength and EXACTLY a 5 card heart suit. I need your help, because I'm not sure whether we should play in hearts or  no trump, or stop in a part score or bid game."
^B@2^Z@3 Now the ball is in opener's court. There are two issues he needs to address;|pg||nt|
^B@2^Z@31. Should the partnership play in hearts or in no trump? If opener has 3+ hearts, the partnership has a 5-3 fit and should play in hearts. If opener only has a doubleton, then the partnership does not have a heart fit and should play in no trump instead.|pg||at|
^B@2^Z@32. Does opener want to accept the game invite (is he in the upper end of his no trump range), or stop in a part score (if he's on the lower end.)|pg||nt|
^B@2^Z@3 In this case, opener has 3 hearts .... so he knows they have a 5-3 heart fit, and therefore should play in a heart contract. Opener is also on the upper end of his range, so he should bid a game.|pg||pc|CQ|mc|11|pg||nt||

qx|o5|pn|sdoty,sdoty,sdoty,sdoty|st||md|1SATHAK43DT75CAQ86,SJ8HQJT6DK432CJ32,SQ6532H92DA96CKT4,SK974H875DQJ8C975,|rh||ah|Board 5|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|an|xfer to 2!S: 5+!S, any strength|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|an|inv (8-9) with exactly 5!S|mb|p|mb|3N|an|max with only 2 spades|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|at|^B@2^Z@3 Responder's 2@H bid was a Jacoby Transfer to 2@S. It showed at least a 5 card spade suit, but didn't say anything else about his hand. Responder's 2NT rebid clarifies both his spade LENGTH and his overall STRENGTH. He shows an invitational strength hand (8-9 points) with -exactly- a 5 card spade suit. |pg||nt|
^B@2^Z@3 Opener is at the top of his range, so he is going to accept the game invite. With his doubleton spade, he knows that they only have a 5-2 spade fit, and should therefore play in no trump instead of in spades. Put the two together, and with 15 counts opener usually declines an invite, and with 17 he should always accept. With 16, it can go either way ... it really depends on the hand, and how well you think it'll fit with your partners. There is no "rule" for 16 counts.|pg||pc|HQ|mc|9|pg||nt||

qx|o6|pn|sdoty,sdoty,sdoty,sdoty|st||md|1SKQ52HJ4DKQ32CA92,SA987HQT9D75CKQ53,SJ3HK8652DA6CJ764,ST64HA73DJT984CT8,|rh||ah|Board 6|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an|xfer to 2!H: 5+!H, any strength|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|an|inv (8-9) with exactly 5!H|mb|p|mb|p|an|minimum with only 2!H|mb|p|at|
^B@2^Z@3Again, responder's transfer followed by 2NT shows an invitational strength hand (8-9 pts) with exactly a 5 card heart suit. Opener has to think about two things: 
^CIs there a heart fit? Does he want to accept the invite?
In this case, the answer to both questions is "no."  They do not have a heart fit, and opener is minimum and wants to stop in a part score.  So he passes out 2NT as the final contract. |pg||pc|S7|mc|7|pg||nt||

qx|o7|pn|sdoty,sdoty,sdoty,sdoty|st||md|1SAJ3H64DKQ43CAJ63,S76HAK532DJ65C942,SKT942HQ87D82CKT8,SQ85HJT9DAT97CQ75,|rh||ah|Board 7|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|an|xfer to 2!S: 5+!S, any strength|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|an|inv (8-9) with exactly 5!S|mb|p|mb|3S|an|min with 3+!S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|^B@2^Z@3 We don't see hands like this too often for some reason, but if opener has a fit but doesn't want to play in game, he can sign-off in 3 of responder's major.|at|
^B@2^Z@3 This responding hand makes people unhappy, but it's an important one to understand. When responder has invitational strength, his options for second bid are limited. When he rebids 2NT, he shows invitational points with exactly a 5 card spade suit... which is what he has. He does NOT, however, guarantee a balanced hand.|pg||nt|^B@2^Z@3 If opener has a fit but doesn't want to play in game, he can sign-off in 3 of responder's major. Responder should not rebid his major unless he has at least 6 of them. And he can't bid a new suit either, because that is a game forcing bid. So he has to rebid 2NT, and trust that opener is going to do what he's supposed to do. IF THE PARTNERSHIP HAS A 5-3 SPADE FIT, opener is going to put it back in spades.|pg||pc|HA|mc|9|pg||nt||

^B@2^Z@3Plus, if opener is short in spades, he rates to have some length/strength in partner's short suit... so you don't have to be overly concerned about being wide open in diamonds. With a hand like this one, responder would like to play in spades... IF they have a spade fit. And you accomplish that just fine by re-bidding 2NT. Since it is opener's job to put you back in spades if he has 3+ card support for you. If responder has game values (10-14), we see the same concept at work.|PG||

Opener's pass says,  "we don't have a heart fit, so let's play game in no trump." |pg||nt|^B@2^Z@3 If you only take away one idea from this lecture, the most important one is the following: |pg||nt|^B@2^Z@3 With the points to invite or force to game, responder never insists on playing in his 5 card major suit. He always gives opener the option of playing in no trump instead, because he (responder) can't be sure that they have an 8 card fit. |pg||at|^B@2^Z@3 This means that opener has to be on the ball, though. If responder transfers and then rebids no trump, it isn't because he wants to play in no trump. If he just wanted to play in no trump, he wouldn't have bothered telling you about his major suit.|pg||nt|^B@2^Z@3 If responder transfers and rebids notrump, it is because he needs you to decide whether the partnership belongs in the major (if you have 3+ card support) or in NT if you only have a doubleton. |pg||at|^B@2^Z@3 If opener has 3+ card support, HE IS EXPECTED TO GO BACK TO RESPONDER'S MAJOR. That's very important. If opener doesn't do that, then the whole thing falls apart. There's definitely some partnership trust involved in these transfer auctions.|pg||pc|C8|mc|9|pg||nt||

^B@2^Z@3 Responder's 3@D bid says that he has
    * exactly 5 hearts
    * 4+ diamonds
    * game values (10+ ... this bid is game forcing) and usually his hand will be unbalanced
^-** The partnership must reach game **

|pg||nt|^B@2^Z@3 Not surprisingly, opener's first priority is to show a fit for responder's heart suit if he has one. From there responder can simply raise to game, or he might start cue-bidding for slam if his hand is that strong (typically 15+.)|

He also has strong holdings in both hearts and diamonds. So, even though responder doesn't rate to have much in the red suits, opener can comfortably place the contract in 3NT and responder doesn't have to worry about passing, because he knows that opener has a good idea of what his hand is like.|pg||pc|D4|mc|10|pg||nt||

^B@2^Z@3Responder has a fantastic hand here, and definitely wants to get to slam. However, he needs to figure out where the partnership belongs... in spades? No trump? maybe even clubs? There's no need for responder to go blasting into the atmosphere right away ... he can take it slow and steady to get the information he needs.|pg||mb|2H|an|xfer to 2!S: 5+!S, any strength|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|
^B@2^Z@3He starts with a simple Jacoby Transfer, to establish that he has a spade suit. He follows it up with a 3@C bid-natural and game forcing. Opener's next bid is going to determine where responder goes from here. When opener bids 3@S, responder knows they have a spade fit-a key piece of information, since now he knows where they should play in (spades). |pg||mb|p|mb|3C|an|natural, game forcing|mb|p|mb|3S|an|3+!S|mb|p|nt|
^B@2^Z@3Over 3@S (which sets spades as trump), responder bids 4@C-this is a control showing cuebid. It also shows responder's slam interest.|pg||mb|4C|an|cuebid|mb|p|mb|4D|an|cuebid|mb|p|nt|
^B@2^Z@3 Once opener cooperates with a 4@D cuebid, responder knows that all of the side suits are under control and he can continue with (RKC) Blackwood. I'm using RKC 1430 today, but this 4NT bid would be whatever kind of blackwood you and your partner have agreed to use. |pg||mb|4N|an|RKC 1430|mb|p|mb|5H|an|2 keycards no !SQ|mb|p|mb|5N|an|specific kings?|mb|p|mb|7S|an|if you're asking for kings, we can bid 7|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|
^B@2^Z@3I don't want to get too caught up in the bidding after 4NT ... that's a topic for another day. The important bids are the ones leading up to 4NT....
NS have a solid, straightforward, NATURAL auction.  Responder doesn't need to go jumping around or try to come up with anything fancy. He uses a nice natural sequence to describe his hand and find out whether or not there's a spade fit and it leaves the partnership plenty of room to exchange information.|pg||pc|DK|mc|13|pg||
