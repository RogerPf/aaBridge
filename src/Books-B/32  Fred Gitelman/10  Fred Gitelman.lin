But as Kia's account (on the next page) of the birth of the BIL shows, Fred Gitelman was key.

^b@2These were written by Fred for the ACBL and were first released as free windows software.  The later conversion to standard lin files was done by Kia (BBO Id 'nome') which is how they come to be available inside aaBridge.

Between 1999 and 2004  Fred wrote a Deal of the Week column which could be downloaded as a lin file.  A couple issues, numbers 200 and 215 were uploaded to the BIL library and are available in the left-hand column.

cp||fp|4|cs||at|^B@2^Z@3As a teenager, Maureen Hall thought about learning to play bridge but, as often happens, study/work/marriage/family put that aside for another day.  When that day came, bridge lessons went very well for Maureen.  "Well, relatively so," she says.  She was soon off to a table at the local Bridge Club.  She only admits that all should feel sorry for the club director.  "The least said the better." 
|n^|6|at|
Maureen, not one to be defeated by 52 cards, decided she would learn to play "this game."  She Googled 'bridge' and found a reference to Bridge Base with the keyword 'educational.'  She opened the site, downloaded, and discovered. ... ... ...
|n^|6|at|
Just ^*bfour^*n tables were at play in the Main Bridge Club, "all experts in my eyes."  Yet, she would still kib and on occasion, play.  As BBO continued to grow, Maureen felt the Main Bridge Club was and "... continues to be a very scary place for beginners and even for some intermediates to try to play and learn and develop their game".
|n^|6|at|
"I would no sooner find a few fellow beginners and they would be gone," she recalls.
|n^|6|at|
She posted an article in the Bridge Base Forum, expressing her view the Main Bridge Club be split so Beginner/Intermediate players might have a separate place to play and learn.  Fred's reply made it clear he would be unable to address that in the near future as he and Uday were focused on development of a tournament facility. 
|n^|6|at|
When the tournament room came into being, the BBO Forum Moderator for the Beginner/Intermediate section Inquiry (Ben) decided to hold a tournament for Beginners and Intermediates.  Alas, Ben's tournaments, too, were overtaken by the Advanced players.
|n^|6|at|
So Maureen polished off a proposal outlining her vision for the BIL, took a deep breath and clicked 'send'. The very next morning, she opened her in box and found Fred's response.  
^c@2^x@3^*IHi Maureen,  I am about to get on a plane and I may not be able to respond to e-mail until Monday, but what you are planning sounds great (I will respond in detail next week) and I have set up your private club.  Regards, Fred^*N 
|FP|4|at|^B@2^Z@3We will not describe the shock, tremor, and emotional earthquake Maureen experienced but will simply tell you on the 3rd of September 2003, the Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL) was born. Maureen's vision, still a work in progress, has offered beginners and intermediate players a 'safe haven' for learning and making friends for many years.
