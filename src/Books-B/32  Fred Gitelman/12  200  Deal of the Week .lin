This being the 200th ^*BDeal of the Week^*N made us feel a little nostalgic so we decided to go back all the way to the birth of contract bridge for this week's deal. This week's deal was played by ^*BHarold S. Vanderbilt^*N who defined the rules and scoring of contract bridge in 1925. Vanderbilt was also one of the best bridge players in the world for many years.

This deal was reported in the very first issue of ^*BThe Bridge World^*N magazine (October 1929) in a feature appropriately named ^*BThe Hand of the Month^*N. This deal is presented as a declarer play problem. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

hs|ss|nt|Vanderbilt became declarer in 6@S after the above auction. We are not sure what most of the bids mean, but Vanderbilt was a pioneer of the strong 1@C system. We suspect that 1@C was an artificial strong bid, 1@D was an artificial negative response (in terms of high cards), and 2NT was an artificial force. We think that the rest of the auction was natural.|pg||
ls|ss|pc|D4|nt|West's opening lead was a small diamond and Vanderbilt's partner (whose name was not mentioned in the article in ^*BThe Bridge World^*N) put down a very strong hand as dummy. Unfortunately the strong hand in dummy did not fit Vanderbilt's hand very well and the contract was far from laydown. Think about how you would play this deal as declarer before reading on.|pg||sk||hs|es|hs|ws|nt|Vanderbilt decided that the contract would be unlikely to make if the trump suit broke 4-1. He therefore assumed that trumps were 3-2 |pg||ls|es|ls|ws|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ss|at|and played to maximize his chances of establishing dummy's club suit under that assumption. |pg||ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ss|hs|ec|hs|es|at|^*BThe Bridge World^*N did not report the exact East-West hands, but the article stated that East was dealt 3 spades to the @SJ and 4 clubs to the @CQ.|pg||ls|ec|ls|es|hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|Vanderbilt's key play came at trick 1 when he won West's diamond opening lead in dummy and discarded the singleton club from the closed hand. |pg||

ls|ndsc|pc|DA|pc|D7|pc|C3|pg||hs|ssnc|at|Next he ruffed a club in his hand |pg||ls|ncss|pc|C2|pc|C4|pc|S2|pc|C6|pg||hs|ns|hs|ss|at|and crossed to the dummy in spades |pg||ls|ns|ls|ss|

Vanderbilt got the good news when he played a second round of trump to the dummy. |pg||ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|ws|ls|es|pc|S7|pc|SQ|pc|SK|pc|S9|pg||hs|nc|hs|es|mc|12|nt|Vanderbilt was now able to claim his contract, stating that he would run the clubs and lose only 1 trump trick at the end. |pg||ls|es|ls|nc|hs|nd|hs|ss|hs|sh|at|Vanderbilt would later ruff 1 of dummy's diamond losers and discard the other diamond loser on his @HA.|

nt|Vanderbilt's elegant line of play guaranteed the contract provided that spades were 3-2 and clubs were no worse than 4-2. |pg||ls|es|ls|ws|ls|ec|ls|wc|hs|nd|hs|sc|at|On the actual layout of the East-West cards the slam would have failed if Vanderbilt had not discarded his singleton club early (barring some serious double dummy play). Well done Mr. Vanderbilt and thanks for inventing such a wonderful game!|pg||ls|nd|ls|sc|pf|y|nt|You can now experiment with how the play of this deal could go by playing cards for all 4 players.
