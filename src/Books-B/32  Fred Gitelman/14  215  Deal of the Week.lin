^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 215 - October 23, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a double dummy problem. We would like to tell you who composed this problem, but we don't know. As you will see shortly, the composer must have been a brilliant analyst. If you have seen this problem before and know who created it, please let us know so that we can give credit where credit is due! 

^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will follow shortly, but first an important announcement:

|pg||cs|4|at|^-{^*B Pay attention - this is not an ad! We are giving away a very nice program for free! ^*N }
^-
|pg||at|^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N is pleased to announce the release of ^*BBridgeVu^*N, a Windows program that is available for free download through this web site:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Bwww.bridgebase.com/bridgevu^*N }
^-
^*BBridgeVu's^*N function is similar to that of the software that is used to present the ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N.  We use the term ^*Bbridge movie^*N to describe these sorts of presentations and refer to ^*BBridgeVu^*N (as well as the program you are using now) as ^*Bbridge movie viewers^*N.

One of the main advantages of using ^*BBridgeVu^*N to watch bridge movies is that you do not have to be connected to the Internet when you use this program. This is especially nice for those in Europe who have to pay for local phone calls.  ^*BBridgeVu^*N is also prettier and nicer to use than the bridge movie viewer that you are using now.

|pg||nt||cs|4|at|
^-{ Wait! There's so much more that ^*BBridgeVu^*N can do and it's ^*Bfree^*N!!!}

|pg||cs|1|at|{ ^*BBridgeVu^*N can be used to review the log files created by ^*BThe Zone^*N and ^*BOKBridge^*N
as "vugraph-style" bridge movies - a great way to review your sessions of online bridge!}

|pg||cs|2|at|{ The bidding and play records of many major tournaments are available as .lin and/or .pbn files.
^*BBridgeVu^*N allows you to watch ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N without having to go online! }

|pg||
cs|3|at|{ We are thinking about distributing ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N to ^*BBridgeVu^*N users via e-mail. 
This will make ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N easier to access and more enjoyable to use.  }

You patience has been rewarded as this is truly a spectacular deal! This is a double dummy problem which makes the bidding irrelevant (good thing). The contract is 6@C by South. |pg||ls|nc|ls|Sc|hs|Wc|at|West's opening lead is the @CQ. |pg||ls|Wc|pc|cq|
nt|Your mission is to find a way for South to win 12 tricks against any defense. You should be warned that this is a very difficult problem in terms of discovering the correct solution. The actual solution is relatively easy to understand and is extremely elegant. We just love this deal!

The solution will be presented starting on the page after that. |pg||pf|y|nt|You can now click on the cards you want to play for all 4 players. These toolbar buttons will be helpful:

pc|C4|pc|C2|pc|CA|pg||hs|nc|hs|Sd|at|then trick 2 must consist of a diamond ruff in the dummy. |pg||ls|nc|ls|sd|pc|D2|pc|D7|pc|C5|pc|DQ|pg||
hs|nc|at|The @CK does not have to be cashed immediately, but it does have to be cashed relatively early in the play and doing it now will simplify the explanation.|pg||ls|nc|
pc|CK|pc|C3|pc|C8|pc|CJ|pg||hs|ns|hs|ws|hs|es|nt|The critical moment in this deal has now been reached. One of dummy's high spades must be cashed. The rest of the play will be radically affected by the spots cards that both defenders choose to play to this trick! Suppose first of all that West follows innocently with the @S6. In this case it doesn't matter if East follows with the @S2 or with a middle spade spot.|pg||ls|es|ls|ws|ls|Ns|

pc|SA|pc|S2|pc|S4|pc|S6|pg||hs|ns|hs|ws|nt|The only winning continuation is to lead the @S3 to West's @S10! |pg||ls|Ns|ls|ws|
pc|S3|pc|S7|pc|S5|pc|ST|pg||
hs|wd|hs|nc|at|This play serves 2 purposes. First, it rectifies the count for a trump squeeze against West (we will get to that soon). Second, it forces West to play a diamond which is ruffed in the dummy (a heart return would make things easy). |pg||ls|wd|ls|Nc|

ls|ns|ls|ws|pc|DJ|pc|C6|pc|DK|pc|D3|pg||hs|wd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|As a result, South can later remove East's last diamond with a single ruff to leave West with the sole guard of that suit. |pg||ls|ed|ls|wd|ls|sd|
hs|nh|nt|It does not hurt to cash one of dummy's high hearts now, but this play is not necessary. |pg||ls|nh|pc|ha|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|pg||
hs|ns|hs|sd|at|The @SK must be cashed next and a diamond must be discarded from the South hand (if the top heart had not been cashed then it would be fine to discard a heart from the South hand instead). |pg||ls|Ns|ls|Sd|
pc|SK|pc|S8|pc|D4|pc|D8|pg||
hs|ns|hs|Sc|at|The @SJ must now be ruffed |pg||ls|ns|ls|sc|

pc|D5|pc|DT|pc|C7|pc|DA|pg||hs|Nh|hs|sc|hs|sd|at|to set up a winner in that suit (with a heart ruff as an entry). |pg||ls|sd|ls|sc|ls|Nh|up|5|hs|wh|at|If West discards a heart instead, |pg||ls|wh|pc|h|pg||hs|sh|hs|nh|at|a heart to the dummy |pg||ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|h|pc|hq|pc|hk|pc|H|pg||hs|nh|hs|sc|at|and a heart ruff in the South hand |pg||ls|nh|ls|Sc|pc|h|pc|h|pc|c|pc|h|pg||hs|nh|hs|nc|at|will establish a heart winner in the dummy (and a trump entry remains to access that winner).|pg||

hs|ns|hs|es|hs|ws|nt|Now let's see what happens if East follows with the @S2 on the first round of the suit while West unblocks the @S10 (instead of following with the @S6 as before). |pg||ls|ns|ls|ws|ls|es|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|S|pc|st|pg||hs|es|hs|ed|at|It is no longer possible to trump squeeze West, but the contract can now be made with an unusual squeeze-endplay against East. |pg||ls|es|ls|ed|hs|nh|at|You must cash dummy's top hearts, |pg||ls|nh|pc|ha|pc|H|pc|H|pc|H|pg||pc|hk|pc|H|pc|h|pc|H|pg||hs|nh|hs|sc|at|ruff a heart in the South hand, |pg||ls|nh|ls|sc|pc|h|pc|h|pc|c|pc|H|pg||hs|nc|hs|sd|at|and ruff a diamond in the dummy.|pg||ls|nc|ls|sd|pc|d|pc|d|pc|c|pc|d|pg||hs|nh|nt|Dummy's last heart is played |pg||ls|nh|pc|h|hs|ed|hs|es|At|and East is squeezed. |pg||ls|es|hs|sc|at|If East discards his last diamond, South ruffs |pg||ls|ed|ls|sc|pc|d|pc|c|pc|h|pg||hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|es|at|and can then duck a spade to East (ruffing a diamond first is also ok). |pg||ls|ns|ls|Ss|ls|es|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|pg||hs|es|hs|ns|at|East is endplayed into leading a spade into dummy's @SKJ. |pg||ls|ns|up|7|hs|es|hs|sc|nt|If instead East discards a spade on the fourth round of hearts, South ruffs |pg||ls|es|ls|Sc|pc|s|pc|c|pc|h|pg||

hs|ns|hs|es|hs|ws|nt|The most challenging defense (which also leads to the most fascinating end position) is for East to drop a middle spade on the first round of the suit while West unblocks the @S10. |pg||ls|ns|ls|es|ls|Ws|pc|sa|pc|s7|pc|s|pc|st|pg||hs|nh|at|Dummy's top hearts must come next |pg||ls|nh|pc|ha|pc|H|pc|H|pc|H|pg||pc|Hk|pc|h|pc|H|pc|H|pg||hs|nh|hs|sc|at|and a heart is ruffed by South. |pg||ls|nh|ls|sc|pc|h|pc|H|pc|c|pc|h|pg||hs|sd|hs|nc|at|South ruffs a diamond |pg||ls|sd|ls|nc|pc|d|pc|d|pc|c|pc|d|pg||hs|nh|at|and leads the last heart from the dummy |pg||ls|nh|pc|H|hs|es|hs|ed|at|to squeeze East in a remarkable way. |pg||hs|sc|ls|ed|nt|If East discards a spade, South ruffs |pg||ls|es|ls|sc|pc|s|pc|c|pc|h|pg||hs|sd|hs|ns|hs|ed|at|and leads a diamond, discarding the @S3 from dummy |pg||ls|ed|ls|ns|ls|sd|pc|d|pc|d|pc|s|pc|d|pg||hs|es|hs|ns|at|to endplay East. |pg||ls|es|ls|Ns|up|7|hs|ed|
