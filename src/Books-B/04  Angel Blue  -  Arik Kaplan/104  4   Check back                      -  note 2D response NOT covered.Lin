ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z1|
ht|f|fp|1|at|Check back Stayman is one of the most useable conventions in modern bridge.

In this part of the movie I intend to introduce the convention and to show you a set of simple-to-apply responses.

The main purpose of the convention is to find eight-card fit in one of the major suits after opener 1NT or 2NT rebid.

It is easy to find a major fit when each partner has four cards in the same major suit. This process is simple – one bids 
the suit and the other shows support.

When opener holds five cards in a major suit and responder has three, any 5-major system allows recognizing the fit 
fast and easy.

The problem may occur when:
^b1.  Responder has five of his major and opener has only three. 
^b    In this case, after a No Trump bid by opener, responder may not rebid the suit with less than six cards. 
^b    As a consequence, the partnership will miss the 5-3 fit.

^b2. Opener has four hearts but he cannot introduce them after responder's 1@S due to a lack of strength for a reverse 
^b    bid. In this case, after a 1NT rebid by opener, responder may not rebid the suit with less than six cards. As a 
^b    consequence, the partnership will miss the 4-4 fit in those cases where responder has also four hearts.

The Check back Stayman  convention intends to solve the problem: the responder can use the unbid minor 
to ask opener about his majors holding. This bid is artificial and indicates nothing about responder's holding in the suit.|

ht|f|cp|2|at|^cHere we can see some examples of Check Back Stayman sequences:|

ht|h|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1dp1sp1np!2c|at|}|

ht|m|cs|1|at|^b{|ia|1cp1hp1np!2c|at|}|

ht|m|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1cp1sp1np!2c|at|}|

ht|r|at|Notice that in all of the above cases, opener's first bid was one of a suit and his rebid was 1NT, which describes a 
balanced 12-14 point hand. Responder's first bid was always one of a major.

Responder's second bid - 2@C or 2@D – aims to opener to give additional information about his holding in the majors.

Many play the convention after the following sequence:|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z3|
ht|f|cp|2|at|Two questions come up now:

1. What kind of hands responder describes by his artificial 2@C rebid?

2. How should opener go about responding to the 2!c bid?

Responder will usually hold:
1) Five cards in his major suit.
2) Eleven points or more.

With six cards in a major suit, responder may simply rebid his suit to set it as the trump suit.

Responder who holds less than eleven points, will preferably keep the contract as low as possible by passing the 
1NT rebid or rebidding his suit at the lowest level.

What do we want to achieve with the Check Back Stayman convention?
To look for a 4-4 fit in the unbid major.
To look for a 5-3 fit in responder's major.
 To get further information about opener's strength.

There are many variations and sub variations around in the bridge world, which I am unable to cover within a single article.

I will do my best to describe the system which is in my opinion easier to learn and to apply. 

However, I will give some references to other common alternatives during the course of describing the main line.|

ht|f|cp|2|cs|1|at|PRIORITIES:

1. After {1@C  -  1@H, 1NT  -  2@C}: Or: {1@D  -  1@H, 1NT  -  2@C}

a. Opener bids 4-card spade suit (had he skipped the suit earlier).
b. Opener shows heart support with three hearts.
c. With none of the above, opener bids 2@D with 12-13 points and 2NT with 14 points.

2. After {1@C  -  1@S, 1NT  -  2@C}: Or: {1@D  -  1@S, 1NT  -  2@C}

a. Opener bids 4-card heart suit.
b. Opener shows spade support with three spades.
c. With none of the above, opener bids 2@D with 12-13 points and 2NT with 14 points.

By following these rules the partnership will most likely end up declaring the hand from the strong side and will help them 
to find the 4-4 fit, if there is such, rather than 5-3 fit. 

Many others prefer to show 3-card support first, while others prefer to show priority to their 4-card major first.

There are also many variations that don't make a distinction between minimum 1NT rebid (12-13 points) and maximum 
1NT rebid (14 points). Players who prefer this variation would always bid their major suit or show major support at the 
two level and deny the major fit by 2@D whether minimum or maximum. 

We have to distinct between two cases:
1. Responder's first bid was 1@H.
2. Responder's first bid was 1@S.|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z5|
ht|f|cp|2|at|Case one: RESPONDER'S FIRST BID WAS 1@H. 

We should assume that had opener held four spades, he would have mentioned the suit instead of bidding 1NT (though, opener may bypass a weak four-card major to rebid 1NT or bypass four spades over a 1@H  response when he is also holds three hearts). Therefore, in any of the following sequences responder is looking only for a 5-3 in heart and not for a spade fit.|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z7|
ht|f|cp|2|at|Case two: RESPONDER'S FIRST BID WAS 1@s. 

The situation now is a bit complicated, that is because responder may show interest not only in 5-3 spade fit but also
in 4-4 fit in hearts.

Now opener has six different responses (compared to the four he has after responder's 1@H bid).
 
^bHere is the basic sequence we are going now to deal with, following with two different hands for responder:|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z10|
ht|f|cp|2|at|The basic rule behind the above sequences is that as after the regular Stayman, opener shows his majors up the line, 
hearts first.

This framework of responses allows the responder to find a possible major fit while discovering whether or not the partnership has sufficient strength for game.

At the end of this part I will show you four complete sequences of the Check Back Stayman convention.|

ht|f|fp|2|cs|1|at|{PART Two}|

ht|h|fp|1|cp|2|at|In the previous part I introduced the basic principles of the convention.

The second part will show some more useful ways to handle typical hands.

Look at the following hand:|


ht|m|cs|1|at|^o{|ih|psA763hK2dA5cAQ962|at|}|
ht|n|cs|1|at|^c{|ia|1cp1sp1Np?|at|}|

ht|t|fp|1|cp|2|at|East has 17 points together with a very good support for West's clubs.

West describes a 12-14 hand without spade support. 

Is there a chance for slam? 

There is not enough for 6NT which demands about 33 HCP, 
but 6@C might be a good spot.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||

ht|e|fp|1|cs|1|at|^o{|ih|psA763hK2dA5cAQ962|at|}|
ht|f|cs|1|at|^c{|ia|1cp1sp1Np?|at|}|

ht|k|fp|1|cp|2|at|Many would bid 3@C, running the risk that partner will not get the correct message. Besides, 3@C should be considered as a limit bid and West can pass this!

4@C maybe? 4@C may be considered as Gerber. But even as a natural bid it takes too much bidding space. Moreover, if West holds only three clubs, it may be correct to stop at 3NT.

So it becomes clear that East has to find a way to show the club support while maintaining a chance to explore for the slam.

What East needs is a way to show the club support by using a forcing bid, simultaneously asking West to give 
additional information about his holding.| 

ht|u|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1cp1sp1Np!2cp|at|}|
ht|u|fp|1|cp|2|at|The Check Back Stayman convention provides the tool:|
ht|z|fp|1|cp|2|at|After every response from West, East would be able to bid 3@C (or 4@C in case West jumps).|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Following the above example, here is the rule: Check back Stayman followed by support for opener's first suit should be considered as a descriptive game forcing bid and slam invitation.| 

ht|h|fp|1|cp|2|at|Here is one more example to re illustrate the idea:|

ht|k|cs|1|at|^j{|ih|hsAJ3h83dAQJ97cT32|at|}^x{|ih|hsK4hAK952dKT85cA6|at|}|
ht|h|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1dp1hp1Np!2cp2dp3dp3sp4Np5sp6dppp|at|}|
ht|p|fp|1|cp|2|at|2@C: Check Back Stayman, asking for three hearts.

3!D: Minimum, no three hearts.

3@D: Diamond support, game force, slam invitation.

3@S: Cue bid. After East's 3@D bid, West reevaluates his hand due to 
his strong 5-card suit and his controls and makes a move towards slam.

4NT: Roman keycard. 4@C was also available as a cue bid.

5@S: Two keycards and the @DQ.

The final 6@D contract is excellent. Notice that 6NT fails after a club lead.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Another application of the Check Back Stayman convention can be used after opener's 2NT rebid.

In this context we should first refer to another question that appears frequently.

Look at the following hand:|
ht|k|cs|1|at|^c{|ih|psAJ42hK5dAK65cA94|at|}|
ht|l|cs|1|at|^l{|ia|1cp1hp?|at|}|
ht|r|fp|1|cp|2|at|The question is: should West show a balanced 18-19 point hand by jumping to 2NT or should he content 
with 1@S and show his strength later?

Though in my opinion 1@S will usually provide better results, many will give priority to 2NT.

Anyway, a partnership should have an agreement on whether or not an opener's rebid of 2NT denies 4-card spades.|
