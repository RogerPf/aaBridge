lg|d|at|^b@2^n@3^*bArik Kaplan^*n (Angel Blue), is a long time supporter of the BIL.  Unusually for a Bridge Teacher he would also write his own Bridge Movies (lin files).
|n^|8|at|
The series on bidding you can see on the left was produced for the BIL by Arik.
|n^|2|at|
At other times he would allow others to turn his work into Bridge Movies.
|n^|8|at|
For a few years he ran a series of  "selected hand" tournaments that I and others converted into bridge movies. See

at|There is also a series of problems originally written by Arik for the BIL, now titled 'Problems for New Players'.
|n^|8|at|
In order to make these problems more accessible to future students they can now be found in the beginners area.
