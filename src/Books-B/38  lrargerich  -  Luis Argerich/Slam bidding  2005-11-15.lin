mn|Luis Argerich [lrargerich]  Slam bidding|
tu|y|
nt|





Today we are going to see some basic tips to improve your slam bidding. We'll be using simple basic conventions, nothing strange or fancy. Basically we'll use cuebidding and RKCB 1430 (0314 is just the same), nothing else. The idea is to have a view or review about how to use RKCB correctly, how to cuebid and some basic tips that you might find useful in your slam adventures.

Let's start with some basic theory about slam bidding.

The procedure is very simple: When your side has found a fit and you have slam interest
You start a control-showing sequence.

One typical question is when a cuebid is a control and when not.
One basic way to answer that is that bids below 3NT are not control showing while bids ABOVE 3NT show controls.

Then more basic questions: What is a control?
A control is a first or second round control in a suit: the Ace, the King, a void or a singleton, with the nice exception of not showing singletons or voids as controls in pd's suit. Example: If partner has bid @c naturally we never cuebid a singleton or void in @c, only an Ace or King.|pg||bt||
nt|





Then the third question: Why do we show controls?
The answer is: Because we don't bid 4NT with 2 quick losers in a suit.

So let's make a very quick introduction to 4NT.

Many people bid 4NT without knowing the requirements for 4NT.

This is a list of requirements for bidding 4NT:
  1) Your side doesn't have 2 quick losers in a side suit.
  2) You have at least 1 keycard, you can't bid 4NT with 0.
     Keycard is 5 Aces Blackwood, the King of trumps counts as an Ace.
  3) You have a plan for every  possible answer to 4NT.
  4) You don't have a void.

Unless you can check the 4 items I listed you can't bid 4NT.

Why no void? Because if you have a void you can never know if your side is missing 2 Aces 
or not.|pg||bt||

sv|o|nt|Topic 1: 4NT requirements|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|
nt|The first 4 bids here should be normal I think. Everything natural.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Now 4@d denies a @c control. With a @c control North would have bid 4@c.

Note: When your side has a double fit You usually bid as if BOTH suits were trumps.
So you can use 6-Aces keycard if you agree that with partner.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Since South doesn't have the club control he knows his side has 2 quick losers in clubs.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|So he just signs off in 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|And there's nothing more to do.|pg||
nt|There is one very typical error, which is bidding 4@h as South after 4@d.
If you think 4@h shows a @h control you are completely wrong.
4@h shows not a @h control but a @c control and may or may not have something in @h.|pg||
nt|The reason is very simple: since partner denied a @c control, when you don't have it you just bid game. There is no point in showing controls in @h if you have 2 quick losers in @c.|pg||
nt|4@h after 4@d shows a @c control because you may not have a @h control and if you have a @c control you must bid 4@h. If partner is missing a @h control after 4@d-4@h, he bids 4@s and you can bid 4NT with the @h control or pass without it.
If partner does have a @h control, knowing you have the @c control he will bid 4NT. When one player knows he can bid 4NT, he bids 4NT - you just have to meet the requirements.|pg||

sv|o|nt|Topic 2: Showing controls

Here we have an example where 4@h shows the @c control.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|
nt|Since 4@d denies a @c control, North just bids 4@s if he knows his side has 2 quick @c losers.|pg||
mb|4H|
nt|As you can see 4@h says nothing about @h but tells partner that @c is not a problem.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|And now South can bid 4NT.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|
nt|We are using RKCB 1430 here. If you want to use 0314 it's the same I don't mind: 1430 vs 0314 is like Coke or Pepsi :). People will claim one is better or the other but is just a matter of preference. I prefer 1430 and Coke. I know players that play 0314 and drink Pepsi and they beat me sometimes so no big deal :).|pg||
mb|5C|
nt|5@c shows 1 or 4 keycards. Of course 1.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|Now this is another situation where many players make mistakes:
4NT is used to learn about 6 important cards: the 4 Aces, the King of trumps and the Queen of trumps.
When the player that bid 4NT is sure his side has the 6 keycards then he MUST bid 5NT.
And if he doesn't know about the 6 critical cards, he CANT bid 5NT.|pg||
nt|Common error: Thinking 5NT asks for Kings. It does NOT!
5NT doesn't ask absolutely anything. 5NT SHOWS!
What does it show? It shows your side has the 6 important cards we mentioned.
After 5NT the other player can directly bid 7 or show kings if he is not sure.|pg||
nt|I hate when you learn simplified versions of things because they assume you are too stupid to learn it right. So if you learnt 5NT asks for Kings it's wrong, the 1st priority after 5NT is to bid 7 if you can.|pg||
nt|There are two schools for showing Kings. Traditional school shows number of Ks. The modern trend is to think that specific Kings are more helpful when you have to decide betwen 6 or 7. Frequently the 5NT responder has 1 King. Showing which King it is is better than saying how many Kings you have because the player that bid 5NT frequently needs one specific King for 7. If you say "1" he is still not sure.|pg||
nt|So let's see this case:

Do we have the 4 Aces? Yes.
Do we have the trump King? Yes.
Do we have the trump Queen? No, but since we have 7 trumps and partner has 3 it doesn't matter.|pg||
nt|Having 10 or more trumps is the same as having the Queen, because unless the suit is 3-0 the Queen is falling under AK.
You ask for the Queen when you don't have it. Here you have it. The 7th trump is the Queen. You are sure of 7 cards in spades because you have 7 cards in spades. And partner has 3+ for his 2@s bid. You don't ask for things you don't need.|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|
nt|Now North knows his side has the 6 critical cards. Let's see how to bid after 5NT.
The first priority after 5NT is to bid 7 if you can count 13 tricks.
North in this case can't count 13 tricks, so he can't bid 7. When you can't bid 7 directly you show Kings, to let partner do the count and see if he can get to 13 with your help.|pg||
mb|6S|
nt|6@s here shows no Kings.
It's better to show specific Kings than the number of Kings you have. So 6@c would show the K@c, 6@d the K@d, 6@h the K@h. 6@s denies a side King. Without a King in the North hand South must play just 6@s which is fine.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|If @c is your suit, then over 5NT you don't have any space, do you?
So when your suit is a minor, 5NT is just an invitation to 7 showing the 6 critical cards.
Grand slam is not impossible: you have 6NT as an option if you look for a grand.
When 6NT is unplayable you have to make sure you don't go overboard.|pg||

sv|o|nt|Topic 3: Counting 13 tricks

Before moving to more examples I need to be sure that some important things are clear. We have to be clear about what control bidding is, and why we use it and how. We have to be clear about what you need to bid 4NT. And we have to be clear about what 5NT is.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|
nt|First 4 bids should look normal.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|
nt|4@c shows a control...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|
nt|... as well as 4@d.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|
nt|5@h shows 2 keycards without the trump Queen, here the @sK and the @hA.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|
nt|Now South can see the 4 Aces, the trump King and the trump Queen, so he must bid 5NT confirming all critical cards are held.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|Now with solid @d North can bid 7. Five tricks in @s, 5 in @d and 2 Aces are 12 tricks and you only need partner to have the @c or @h King for 13.|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|So burn in your mind that 5NT SHOWS and after 5NT if you can bid 7 you just bid 7.|pg||

sv|o|nt|Topic 4: Queen asking relay|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|
nt|Now we have 2 ways to bid with the East hand: 2NT or 2@c.
If you play Jacoby 2NT then we use 2NT.
If you play "naturalish", we bid 2@c.
We are going to do both; J2NT in this and "naturalish" on next topic :-)|pg||
mb|2N|
nt|2NT is Jacoby 2NT, artificial, shows 4+ @h and GF (game forcing) values.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|
nt|3@d shows a singleton, as it is used when you play Jacoby.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|
nt|3@h does not show or deny anything. Usually 3@h shows a hand that is not strong enough to cuebid and not weak enough to bid 4@h which is the weakest bid available. Something in the middle: he has values (@c control) but he has a waste in @d. 3@h is GF. Delayed support playing SAYC is almost always game forcing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|
nt|3@s is a control...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|
nt|... as is 4@c.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|
nt|5@c shows 1 or 4 keycards. Obviously 1.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|After 5@c West is missing 2 of the 6 critical cards: one Ace and the trump Queen.
Whenever we need the trump Queen either for 6 or for 7 we can't bid 5NT since that as we have seen would confirm all the critical cards.|pg||
mb|5D|
nt|So we use the "relay", in this case 5@d to ask for the trump Queen. 
This the standard RKC procedure... I would say 90% standard.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|How do you bid after partner asks for the Queen? 
It's simple:
A return to trumps at the lowest level available will deny the Queen.|pg||
nt|When you have the trump Queen and
  - a side suit K: bid a new suit;
  - some extra values that can't be shown (either a K that can't be bid because you go
      beyond 6, or side Queens): bid 5NT;
  - without any extra values: jump to 6 in trumps.|pg||
mb|6D|
nt|In this example we have already bid the @cK, so we follow the important principle of not showing the same thing twice and bid 6@d showing the @dK and the trump Queen.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|
nt|Of course West signs off in 6@h since we are missing an Ace. 

"Thanks partner for your kind information, but I was just asking to play 6." |pg||

sv|o|nt|Topic 5: Showing trump Queen|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|
nt|3NT shows a balanced hand, strongish without a singleton to be bid. It's never to play.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|
nt|4@c is a cuebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|
nt|4NT asks|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|
nt|5@s shows 2 keycards WITH the trump Queen. This is the important thing here: when you know you have 10+ trumps, show the Queen even when you don't have it, because you don't need it. The 5th @s is the Queen.|pg||
nt|You don't have to alert this. In the USA bids above 3NT are non alertable unless it is your first bid in the auction. In many countries the same is used.
2+Q is a short and normal explanation when you self-alert playing on BBO.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|North knows partner has the @hA, the @dA, the @sQ and the @cK or a singleton.|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|Since North has no losers at all he just bids 7. When trumps split 3-0 you can throw your cards to the air and yell terrible things.
7@s seems to be always better than 7NT unless you have a strong side suit.|pg||

sv|o|nt|Topic 6: South African Transfer|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4C|
nt|4@c here is a 4 level transfer to 4@h. Called South African Transfer. You can use Texas also and bid 4@d as a transfer to 4@h. But here is not like Coke vs Pepsi. I believe South African transfers are a lot better than Texas.|pg||
nt|The reasons are the following ones: first of all, You eliminate Gerber which is probably the best thing you can do for your bidding. Gerber alters the planet and must disappear.
Q: Why do so many hate Gerber?
A: Ask the planet :-) Every time you use Gerber a tree is cut. Every time you use Gerber an endangered animal dies. Eartquakes have been attributed to Gerber.|pg||
nt|Ok, but let's do a brief short discussion of South African (SA) vs Texas.
First a short explanation of what is this.
Playing SA transfers, 4@c is a transfer to 4@h and 4@d a transfer to 4@s.
Playing Texas, 4@d is a transfer to 4@h and 4@h to 4@s.|pg||
nt|The good thing about SA transfers is that you keep 4@h and 4@s as natural when you want to play the game from the other side. In fact you can choose from which side to play it.
When you have for example @sxx, @hQJxxxxx, @dKx, @cKx You can bid 4@h directly to protect the kings from the lead.|pg||
nt|The second reason is that partner can't forget that 4@h is a transfer :-). Texas accidents are very costly.|pg||
nt|The third reason is the most important one to me: you can agree to play 4@c and 4@d as transfers even under any competition.
So if partner opens 1NT and they bid 3@s, You can calmly use 4@c and play 4@h from his side.
When they compete, 4@h and 4@s should remain natural.|pg||
nt|If you play Texas the meaning of 4@h can be unclear in some wild auctions. Is that to play or a transfer? Oh my god, better not play this :-)
If you have a way to transfer, nothing wrong with playing from the strong side, as long as partner knows what you are doing.|pg||
nt|Q: What can I do with a long minor suit then after 3@s intervention?

A: You can double 3@s and then bid the minor.|pg||
nt|Q: Do we play transfers only with 6+ cards suit?

A: At the 4 level, yes. If you have 5, you have to start with a 2 level transfer
and look for support before bidding 4NT to avoid a 5-2 fit which is not very good.|pg||
nt|Q: If you have a game going hand and five of the suit but you have all the honors could you still transfer at the four level?

A: It's a judgement call, I would say yes. But with all the honors 3NT should play better without support. That's my opinion.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|
nt|So 4@c is a transfer...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|
nt|and 4NT is RKCB.

A 2 level transfer followed by 4NT would have been quantitative.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|
nt|5@d shows 0 or 3 keycards.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|Now West wants to know about the @h Queen.|pg||
mb|5H|
nt|When you bid 5@h over 5@d (0 or 3 keycards) and you know partner has 3, it's never a signoff. Burn in your mind that partner can't ask for Aces to play 5 when you have 3. That doesn't make any sense. So 5@h here asks for the Queen.|pg||
nt|If you think this is a lot to remember I must tell you this is not to be memorized.
All we said is pure logical. Do you have to remember that 5@h here is not a signoff?
I don't think so, if you think you will realize partner can't bid 4NT to play 5@h when you have 3 keycards. If partner asks 4NT and you have 3 keycards, you are going to play at least a slam.|pg||
mb|p|
nt|How do we answer?
6@h would deny the Queen.
5@s, 6@c and 6@d will show the Queen and the King in the suit.|pg||
mb|5N|
nt|So 5NT shows the Queen and no side King.
With 4 cards in @h we would have shown the Queen too even without it, because partner has at least 6 @h. So a 4th card would be the tenth trump and replace the Queen of trumps as we know.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|
nt|If you want to be VERY neat, over 5NT you bid 6@c. 
5NT now denies the @sK, @cK or @dK. So what is 6@c? 
It can't be asking for the @cK because opener already denied it. So it asks for 3rd round @c control.|pg||
nt|It means "I need a doubleton or a @cQ to play 7, dear partner. If you have a nice doubleton or the nice @cQ please bid 7."|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|7@h means "Yes, Sir!"
This is again pure logical. When you know partner knows about the AK of @c, a non natural bid in the suit can only ask for the Queen.|pg||

sv|o|nt|Topic 7: Exclusion RKCB

We have said we don't bid 4NT with a void. So we need to learn 2 things:
One is how to answer 4NT when we have a void.
The other is how to ask for Aces with a void without bidding 4NT.|pg||
mb|1S|
nt|South opens 1@s...|pg||
mb|2D|
nt|... and West overcalls 2@d.
Now North wants to know about the AK of @s and the @h Ace in order to decide what to play. If partner has AK of @s and the @hA we play 7@s. If one of those cards is missing we can play 6@s. If two of those cards are missing we play 5@s.|pg||
nt|Very simple plan. The only problem is that we can't use 4NT because the @d Ace will then enter the responses and we don't care about the @dA.
This is why we never bid 4NT with a void, because then we can't tell if partner is showing the Ace we don't need.|pg||
mb|5D|
nt|A good convention is Exclusion RKCB. It is used by making a jump to 5m (minor) or 4@s, specially when opponents have bid the suit. And the meaning is:
"I'm asking Aces (keycards) but please don't count the @dA".
That's why it is called "Exclusion", because the suit bid is "excluded".|pg||
mb|p|
nt|The answers have to be agreed with your partner.
I play very simple step responses: 0, 1, 2, 3.

So 5@h = 0, 5@s = 1, 5NT = 2, 6@c = 3 Aces|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|7S|
nt|And we solve a difficult hand in just 4 bids :-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|In this case, the bid would be the same without the opps bidding.
Q: What 5@s would be over 2@d?
A: When they have overcalled a suit, a jump to 5 in a suit we have is used to ask partner to bid 6 if he can control the suit. In this example 5@s would mean: "Partner, if you have a control in @d please bid 6."|pg||
nt|Q: Should 5x to ask Exclusion rkcb be a jump or not, so for example after 4@s 5@d is ex rkcb?

A: That will require a little coffe talk with partner. If you agree it is, yes.|pg||
tu|y|
nt|The goal today was to see several topics about slam bidding.
Hope you find some of the tips useful.|pg||
bt||
tu|y|
nt|





Before finishing, two quick tips for special cases. 

First: What to do when they overcall your 4NT bid? For example you bid 4NT and LHO in a display of arrogance inserts a 5@c bid.

You have to agree then the meaning of double and pass.
One way is to use DEPO (Double = Even, Pass = Odd): double shows 0/2/4
The other way is DOPE (Double = Odd, Pass = Even): double shows 1/3/5

Q: How do you show 3?
A: You show 3 showing an odd number. If when you show an odd number and partner signsoff in 5, you bid 6. Remember when you have 3 or 4 and partner asks you play a slam.

If you have a regular partner talk this with him before you need it :-)

ROPE is used when they double 4NT
Redouble = Odd, Pass = Even|pg||
bt||
nt|





The second detail that we need to comment is what to do when dear partner bids 4NT and you have a void?

Then you can use some special responses as long as you don't force partner to play 7 :-)
For example you can use 5NT = ODD Number and a useful void, and
6x = Even number and a useful void in the suit mentioned.

A useful void is a void that you know partner will like, not a void in his suit for example :-)

When you can't show the void without going past 6 you can jump to 6 in the trump suit to show Even number of keycards and a useful void that can't be shown. Partner will be able to tell which void you have.|pg||
