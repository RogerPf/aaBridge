at|Welcome all!

Today we'll have a short lesson about some common concepts in NT play.

Maybe you are not even aware of those concepts but that won't be a problem.

The first topic is about the "Holdup play": declarer refuses to win a trick in order to break opponents' communications. 

The second topic is about the "Avoidance play": declarer avoids dangerous opponent to get the lead at wrong time.

The third topic is about the "Safety play": declarer guards against possible bad break.
|pg||
at|
You will hear some rules in this lesson. But the main "rule" you have to be aware of is:

^-{ Rules have to be used AFTER thinking and not before.
 Always think about the hand in logical terms, don't use rules or tools blindly. }

nt|I will start with a very common topic: The holdup play.
|
sk|S|mb|pp1N|
at|This should be a fairly common auction here.
|pg||
sk|N|mb|p2C|at|North asking about majors with Stayman...|
pg||
sk|S|mb|p2S|pg||
sk|N|mb|p2N|an|Maybe 3NT?|at| then inviting to game.
|pg||
sk|S|mb|p3N|an|Why not?|at|And finding South with the middle of the range but a fairly nice hand so enough to accept.
|pg||
mb|ppp|pg||
sk|W|at|Knowing that South has spades and North probably has hearts the opening lead should be easy: a club.
|pc|C3|pg||
sk|S|at|So we have a normal auction, normal lead, everything is normal here.
|pg||
nt|Our first topic is then the holdup play.
|
cs|2|
at|
^-{ A holdup is a play you make to limit communications between the defenders. }
^-|
at|
How it would work here if we use it?
|pg||
at|We would duck the first 2 club tricks...|
pc|C2CKC7|pg||
pc|C5C8CTC4|pg||
pc|CQS2C9CA|at| win the third round|pg||
sk|E|pc|HJH6H4HK|at| and eventually when we lose the heart finesse we'll hope that East has no more clubs to play, assuming that West has started with 5 clubs.
|pg||
sk|S|at|Very nice and very "theoretic" I would say.|pg||
up|15|nt|We also know a dreaded rule known as "Rule of 7" that we are supossed to use for the holdup play.
How does that rule work?
|pg||
cs|2|
at|
^-{ You add the number of cards you have in the dangerous suit between dummy and your hand 
and then substract that number from 7. }
^-|
hc|c2478A|
at|
So here for clubs: 7 - ( 3 + 2 ) = 2. That is the number of rounds we should duck (holdup) in clubs.|pg||lc|c2478A|
nt|Great rule, it suggests exactly what we thought before.
However, everything is wrong :)
Do you see why that line of play would be wrong?|pg||
pc|C2CK|
at|
East plays the club K here.|pg||
at| If we duck|pc|C7|pg||
hc|SQJThK|sk|E|at| he can see 5 defensive tricks shifting to spades: 3 @s + 1 @h and the club he already made.|pg||lc|SQJThK|
sk||pc|SK|at|
So not only he ^*Bcould^*N switch but he certainly ^*Bwill^*N.|pg||
up|4|sk|S|at|
So is this a case of bad luck for the holdup play and "Rule of 7" or did we do something wrong?|pg||
nt|Let's see what we did wrong.
The first thing we need to do here is to check the opponent's CC (Convention Card) or ask if no CC to see if they lead 4th best against NT. (Some players lead low with attitude, not 4th best, but the common thing is 4th best).
|pg||
at|Assuming the lead is 4th best we'd realize that Clubs are 4-4.
Why?|pg||
hc|c2|at|
Because we have the @c2 :).|pg||
nt|If West has 5 clubs then the 3 can't be 4th best. He would have a card lower than the 3 (the 5th club) and that is impossible.
Do we all see and agree with this? Please ask me if not, don't be shy.|pg||
at|
Kibitzer: I don't understand.
Ok let me try again.|lc|c2|pg||
nt|Ask yourself the question: Can West have 5 clubs?
If he has 5 clubs he has X X X X X (5 unknown cards).
We also know the lead is the 4th club (4th best leads) so he has X X X 3 X.
Now which is the 5th club?
|pg||
at|If the 3 is 4th best, the 5th club has to be the 2  (X X X 3 2).
But that can't be possible here because the 2 of clubs is in dummy.
Then West has only 4 clubs. That means clubs are 4-4.|pg||
nt|Is this important?
|pg||
hc|dAKQJhAQTcAsA|at|A lot! Because if clubs are 4-4 then "key concept" Clubs are not dangerous.
We can afford to lose 3 clubs and 1 heart here and we'll make 4 @ds +, 3 @hs and 2 black aces (9 tricks).
|pg||lc|dAKQJhAQTcAsA|
at|
So with that in mind we can make a simple plan: "Win the lead, and take the heart finesse".|

sk||up|21|nt|Let's get some conclusions here:
|
cs|2|
at|
^-{ 1) The holdup play only makes sense if the opening lead is dangerous. }
^-|
at|
When the opening lead makes the contract safe, then holding up might be dangerous if the defense shifts to some other suit.|pg||
nt||cs|2|
at|
^-{ 2) The holdup play is a tool. }
^-|
at|
And as any other tool you should use it when you need it. 

"If you only have a hammer all the problems seem to be nails" :).

Questions about this example and the holdup play?|pg||
nt|Q: I'm not sure of the logic here. If West had K, Q, 10, 6, 3, he would lead the 6, right?
A: Probably the K from K Q 10. But 6 from K 10 8 6 3, for example. On those cases our best bet is to holdup in clubs and hope they don't find a spade shift.|pg||
nt|Q: If the lead was a spade I think it would be necessary to hold up because West is a dangerous opponent?
A: On a spade lead we shouldn't holdup either, because of the same logic. 
We have 7 spades between dummy and our hand. Unless spades are 5-1 we can lose only 3 spades. Losing 3 spades and a heart is fine. And even if spades are 5-1 then East is out of spades after winning the first trick. So in any case on a spade lead we should win the ace and take the heart finesse. 
If the finesse loses then if East has a spade to play the suit was 4-2 and nothing happens. And if the suit was 5-1 East has no spades to play and we are home.|pg||
nt|If we duck a spade we go down if they shift to clubs at trick 2.

So we'd duck a club K lead or a club 6 lead or a club 5 lead but we'd win a club 3 lead or a spade lead (any spade).

Of course on a spade lead from 8 5 with East having K Q J 10 we'd also call the FBI.
Just in case... :).|pg||
nt|Q: Rule at 7 doesn't work?
A: I wouldn't say that in general terms, but I do think that Rule of 7 is one of the things you should use very carefully, if ever.
First you have to decide if holding up makes sense or not (first of all).
And then, if you need a rule to know how many times to holdup, then how did you answer the first question? :)
If you think about the hand you usually don't need a rule to know how many times to holdup if you decide to do it.|pg||
nt||
cs|2|
at|
^-{ Rules have to be used AFTER thinking and not before.
 Always think about the hand in logical terms, don't use rules or tools blindly. }
^-|
at|
Hope that was clear, nothing against Rule of 7 except that it is very dangerous to use it blindly.|pg||
sk|E|pc|c3c2|
nt|Side Note:

East ^*BHAS^*N to play the King here and not the Jack|pg||
at|, because the opening leader can be leading from A 10 x x vs NT and you don't want declarer to make the all-famous "impossible queen", do you? :)

rh||ah|Board 02|ah|Avoidance play|
nt|The 2NT opening is one of the worst things that can happen to your side, because it is very similar to a preempt: you remove the 1 and 2 level bids completely. Why would you want to preempt your own partner when you hold half the deck?|
sk|S|
mb|p|mb|2N|pg||
mb|p|sk|N|mb|3C|at|
What do we play here? Regular Stayman? Puppet? Romex? Not the topic of today's lesson but check with your partner and see if you know how to bid after 2NT opening.|pg||
sk|S|mb|p|mb|3N|an|No 5 or 4-card major|nt|Let's say we are playing Puppet Stayman.

If you don't play Puppet or Romex Stayman over 2NT be careful because you can have a 5 card major for a 2NT opening
and many times you need to know if partner has 5 or 4 cards in a major, so how do you find that?
Never mind, that is for some other day :).
|pg||
mb|ppp|
sk|W|at|What else can West lead but a spade here? So here we go.|pc|S5|pg||
sk|S|nt|This is another typical NT scenario: "We have to play 2 suits". 
In this case hearts and diamonds. It is clear that playing only one suit is not enough for 9 tricks, even with the best breaks.
For example, if hearts are 3-3 with the K onside we can make 4@hs, 2@ss and 2@cs but we still need a diamond trick.
So it is clear we have to play both hearts and diamonds here, do you all agree with that?|pg||
nt|Now we have to think which suit to play first. And here is when a very common mistake can happen.
|
cs|2|
at|
^-{ Common mistake: Play the nicest/longest/better suit first. }
^-|pg||
at|
Why is that wrong?|pg||
at| Because it doesn't make any sense.
If we have to play 2 suits, we have to play 2 suits, and which one is nicer is totally irrelevant to our line of play.
Hope that makes sense to you.|pg||
nt|So how we decide which suit to play first?
The answer is usually based on timing.

We have to lose the lead potentially twice here: one to the player with the @dA and potentially one to the @hK.
So now it is just time to check both options because we only have 2 scenarios:|pg||
nt|Plan "A": Hearts First
We take a heart finesse|pc|S3|pc|SJ|pc|SK|pg||
pc|H5H8HJHK|at| (let's assume it loses).|pg||
at|
East continues with spades removing our last stopper.|pc|S9SAS8S4|pg||
sk|W|hc|sQT4dA|at|
Now if West has the @dA down we go (losing @dA and 3 more spades).|pg||
lc|sQT4dA|sk|S|up|11|
nt|Q: How about hold up in spades?
A: Holding up in spades is problematic because of a club shift.
If we duck a spade... |pc|s3SJs2|pg||
at| and they shift to clubs...|pc|cQ|pg||
at| do we duck or win?
If we duck the club ...|pc|c8c2c5|pg||
at| then back another spade... |pc|s9|pg||
at| and we are in the same position as before but we also lost a club.
So logic dictates that ducking the lead is no good here (I learned that from the first board) :).|pg||
up|8|
nt|So in Plan "A" we go down if East has the diamond ace and the heart finesse loses.
We win if the heart finesse wins or West has the diamond ace.
|pg||
at|Let's check Plan "B": Diamonds first.
We win the spade lead ...|pc|s3sJsK|pg||
at| and play diamonds.
|pc|dK|pg||
at|Somebody wins the ace ...|pc|dAd4d7|pg||
at| and replays spades (both have spades to play so it's the same who wins).|pc|sTs6s9|pg||
at| Now we can duck a spade because a club shift would be harmless once the diamond ace is out since we have 2 stoppers.|pc|s2|pg||
at| 
So we win the third round and we are out of stoppers.|pc|sQs7d8sA|pg||
nt|Q: And we have decided that East has only 2 spades?
A: Either 2 or 3, is the same if 3 rounds of spades have been played.
Now the good thing in Plan "B" is that we can take the heart finesse and East will be out of spades if he started with 2 or 3.

So in Plan "B" it doesn't matter who has the @dA or where the @hK is. That's very good.|pg||
nt|Is Plan "B" 100% safe?
|pg||
at|Not completely, but close.
We can go down in Plan "B" if the opening lead (West) is from 2 or 3 spades.
But that is - I hope you agree - very rare.
So do we all agree Plan "B" is better than Plan "A"?
Ok let's play it!|up|15|pg||
pc|S3|pc|SJ|nt|Using what we learned on board ##1, we can see that clubs and spades are symmetric here: AKx with xxx.
If both suits are exactly the same, ducking is not logic, because if we duck in spades the shift to clubs will put us in the same position but having lost a trick.|pg||
at| So we win the spade...|pc|SK|pg||
pc|DK|pc|DA|pc|D4|pc|D7|at| and play diamonds first.
|pg||
pc|SQ|pc|S6|pc|S9|at|Now we have Ax in spades and AKx in clubs. So now ducking makes sense.
|pc|S2|pg||
at|
We might call this a "delayed holdup" :) but it is clear that ducking here can help and can't be a problem.
If they shift to clubs or something we just claim :).|pg||
pc|ST|pc|S7|pc|D8|pc|SA|pg||
pc|H4|nt|Now the heart finesse...
|pc|H9|pc|HJ|pc|HK|pg||
at|Q: If East ducks, what do we do?
A: We can repeat the finesse without danger :). Diamond back, heart again, nothing bad can happen.
|pg||
pc|CQ|pc|CA|pc|C2|pc|C5|
at|And we are home making 3 @ds, 2 @hs, 2 @s and 2 @cs.|pg||

rh||ah|Board 02|ah|Avoidance play|ah|Postmortem|
up|32|nt|Q: The reason to duck spades? Is it to make sure East is out of that suit and cannot lead it back?
A: We duck to remove spades from East in prepation for the heart finesse, so we take the finesse in a safe way.
The trick here is that we can't duck at trick 1 because a shift to clubs can make us very dizzy. So we don't duck trick 1. We drive the diamond ace and then we duck the spade.

Normally if you have to duck it is good to duck early.
But not today :).|pg||
nt|In "easy" contracts you have to be a pesimist declarer, to think about what can go wrong and be careful.

In "hard" contracts you have to be an optimist, to make sure if there is one winning scenario and you can see it.
|
cs|2|
at|
^-{ So be a pesimist in easy contracts and an optimist in difficult ones. }
^-|pg||
nt|Side Note 1: When you have AKx in NT as declarer, is it better to win with the Ace or the King?
|pg||
at|Answer: It depends, but the K is right in more cases, I think.
The problem is that the Ace does not necesarily hide the K. With Axx you would probably be ducking, not winning the Ace. So if you win quickly with the Ace you probably have the King -me thinks- :).
With Kxx you HAVE to win, because ducking with Kxx is probably very crazy.
So with Axx you can win or duck, with Kxx you need to win. That is why with AKx winning the K is harder to read for the defense than the Ace.|pg||
nt|Side Note 2: Look at South's diamonds. Opening the suit, do we play K, Q, J or Ten here?
|pg||
at|Answer: It really doesn't matter in this board :). But it is good to know what is the "theory" anyway:
|
cs|2|
at|
^-{ Play high when you want to lose the trick,
 play low when you don't want them to win the trick. }
^-|pg||
nt|If we need to "steal" a diamond trick we'd play the Jack or Ten here.
If we want to remove the Ace quickly we'd play the K.

In this particular case it doesn't matter, because we'll play diamonds until the ace appears, and we don't care when.|pg||
nt|Side Note 3: Finessing the @hJ, if East ducks this trick no damage is done, because we have started with 3 hearts in South.
But had South started with 2 hearts, we can't repeat the finesse: we could end with only 1 heart trick if West was clever to duck the first finesse (no entry to the table then).

sk|N|nt|Our last example will be quite easy because the first two hands were very "dense" in things to think.

Kibitzer2: Pass.

Not 3NT with 6 cards please :). It would be ok with 7 but not with 6.

at|Kibitzer6: 2@C
2@c is game forcing, unless you play something special don't do it :). In SAYC, 2/1 and some other standard systems 2@c is artificial and game forcing.|pg||
nt|I said it is very clear what is right. And trust me, I'm serious.
So you ask "What is right, you genius?" :)
|pg||
at|
The answer is: I don't know, but you do :).|pg||
nt|You have your own style and that is the key to the answer.
If you are "known" to open 3@c with QJxxxx and out, then don't open 3@c here because your partner will be very dizzy.
If you are "known" to open with 10HCP and light hands, then go ahead and open 1@c, this is nicer than your other 1x openings.
If you are known to open very solid preempts, then open 3@c.
If you are known to be a wild preemptor and a solid opener, then pass.
You have a style, use it! As long as you are consitent with your style nothing wrong can happen once partner gets used to your style.|pg||
nt|If you ask me, I'm very close to opening 1@c as I play.
I'd never in my life open 3@c with AKQ at these colors.
Maybe with Jxxxxx of clubs and out (6 cards!) I would open 3!c white vs red in 1st seat.
You might say "Oohhhh, terrible!"
But what can be terrible if partner is going to pass with 18 and say "Hope he makes it".
If your partner knows your style then you are fine.|pg||
nt|I had a partner once that opened 2@h.
I tabled AKQxxx of hearts as dummy :). He made 3.
|pg||
at|That same partner opened 2@s once and I passed with 19.
Down 1.

Whoever says what you have to do here is not teaching you how to play, but is teaching you what style you should have. 
And that is dangerous without a deep knowledge of the player and the person.|pg||

up|15|nt|Now our Side Notes :).
Do we always duck one with AKQxxx and xx?|pg||
at|
Of course not! We duck only if:
a) We don't need 6 tricks but 5;
b) We don't have entries to the suit, and
c) We are playing IMPs.
If any of those conditions is false we just play AKQ of clubs and see/hope/wish the suit is 3-2.|pg||
nt|Q: Would you always go for 6 in MPs?
A: Yes, without consideration. 
Taking the safety play at MPs will have some consequences. 
One is that you will score a top or a bottom: 
^ba top if clubs are 4-1, 
^ba bottom if they are 3-2. 
The bad news is that 3-2 is more probable than 4-1, so your bottom score will be probable.|pg||
nt|The second problem is that your partner, maybe quiet up to that board, will have a lot to ask. And the conversation won't be nice:
"What the...?"
"I'm a genius, if clubs are 4-1 only me wins this hand!"
"Let me write the score: 630 everybody, 600 for us.... did you say genius?"

In order to encourage the user to try to evaluate, bid and play every hand yourself a few features have been added:

   @2During the bidding only the actual hand (the one that is to bid) is displayed.

During the play you can see only declarer's hand (and dummy, of course).

You can display any hand at any time if you click on the player's name. Double clicking the name will show all hands.

After the hand is played you can repeat it on your own playing all four hands, trick by trick. You may play whatever cards you like! Just click on the card you wish to play. The most recently played card may be taken back by clicking on ^$6 , Undo. Once a trick is complete, click on the first card of the next trick. Inspect a played trick by pointing at it with the mouse.|pg||
