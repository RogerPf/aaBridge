This is the key phrase. Say to yourself:-

"What would be a forcing bid?" 

Now bid at 1 level higher. |

This is done by bidding the first available first round control. If he is not interested, he will sign off in game of the agreed suit. |

After North opens 1@h South evaluates his hand. 15HCP + 5 for the void. This makes 20. Surely this is enough for a slam. Either a small or even a grand. |

You need to know where your partner's points are.|
