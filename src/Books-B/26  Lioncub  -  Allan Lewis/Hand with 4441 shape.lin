^- |pg||fp|1|cd|4|at|
Open the lowest 4-card suit, and bid all suits up the line. 
|pg||cd||fp||at|
^-By doing this, you will find any 4/4 fit at the one level.|pg||at|

If the bidding goes 
^-{Opener   Responder
^l1@c ^o1NT}
^-
then responder has shown exactly 6 to 9 HCP and a 4-card club suit. This must be the case, as he has denied any other 4 card suit.|pg||nt||ht|f|at|With a singleton spade you should open 1@c. This gives partner a chance to bid 1@d or 1@h thus discovering a 4/4 fit at the one level. |pg||cs|3|at|

However if he bids 1@s, he will have denied any other 4-card suit other than spades. He probably has a 5-card suit in spades (see below). Now you make a {best bid available} . Your rebid will be 1NT (assuming you are in the right point range).

Playing strong NT(15-17), a rebid of 1NT shows 12-14. |pg||at|

You ^*ishould^*n have 2 cards in spades, which you haven't. However there is no danger. if partner is 5/3/3/2, he will have no necessity to repeat his spades. He will either pass with a minimum hand or make another bid. |pg||at|

If he is 5/4/2/2 he will next bid his 4-card suit which ^*imust^*n be hearts, diamonds or even clubs. |pg||at|If he had 4 card club support, he sensibly decided to show a major suit before showing support. |pg||at|

If he repeats his spade suit, then he will be showing a 6-carder, which you will now pass. No big deal playing with a 6-1 fit. |pg||nt||ht|f|fp|1|at|^-IF YOU MAKE A REBID AT THE 2 LEVEL WITH A NEW SUIT, THIS 
GUARANTEES HOLDING FIVE CARDS IN THE FIRST SUIT. 
|pg||fp||at|
^-Some play that showing a second suit at the 2 level is forcing. I don't agree. |pg||cs|2|at|

Holding 5 spades and 4 hearts with about 9 points, the bidding might be,
^-
{Opener   Responder
^l1@c ^o1@s
^l1NT ^o?}
^-
and you would want to find the best part score spot.|pg||at|

You would rebid 2@h. Partner with a preference to spades will bid 2@s, and it is at his liberty to pass with 4 hearts. Of course if the heart bid vastly improves his hand, he will make another bid. |pg||nt||ht|f|cs|2|at|A word about preference. When asked to chose between partner's 2 suits, always give preference to the first bid UNLESS you hold 2 or more cards in the second suit than you do in the first.

For example with this sequence:-
^-{Opener   Responder
^l1@c ^o1@s
^l1NT ^o2@h
^l?}|pg||at|

^-With 2 spades and 3 hearts, you should bid 2@s

A lot of players are frightened about giving preference with just a doubleton, Partner should not be surprised, in fact he should be aware of the fact that you have just shown simple preference. |pg||nt||ht|f|at|^-If you are playing SAYC
^-
Strictly speaking holding 4 clubs and 4 diamonds, SAYC tells you to open 1@d. |pg||at|

If you have a flat hand (3/2/4/4 or 2/3/4/4) then it makes no difference what you do. You would rebid 1NT over partner's major suit bid (assuming he shows the other major) with 12 - 14 points. |pg||at|

However if the opponents come in, it is good to know where your 4-4 fit lies, in order to compete. It is easier to find this fit by opening 1@c rather than 1@d.|pg||at|

Over 1@C partner with a 4-card diamond suit will bid 1@d. As shown above you continue to bid all 4-card suits up the line until you reach 1NT. |pg||nt||ht|f|cs|3|at|
