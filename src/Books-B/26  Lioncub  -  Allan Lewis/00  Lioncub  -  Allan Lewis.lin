at|^*bLioncub  -  Allan Lewis^*n ('Lioncub' on BBO) gave a large number of lessons and classes for the BIL.  This happened from roughly  2007 to 2008.

(Kia 'nome' was responsible for making most if not all of those Bridge movies.  These appear to be Kia's earliest work, pre-dating the start of his massive Hondo Mentoring series - look under  |cp|red|at|^*bBooks^*n|cp||at|  in the menubar. ) 

To make the 'lesson structured' bridge movies more easily accessible to future students they have been moved from here,   |cp|green|at|^*bBIL-2020^*n|cp||at|   to be
