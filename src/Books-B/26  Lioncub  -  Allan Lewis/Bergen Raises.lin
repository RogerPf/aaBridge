3d|1|nt||bg|5|bt||cm|Y|mn|Bergen Raises|bt||nt||cm|n|cs|2|tu|1|ht|f|at|Bergen Raises apply when partner (playing 5-card majors) opens 1 of a major. The theory is that you want to bid to the level of the combined length of your trump suit, according to "The Law of Total Tricks". 

I.E. With 4-card support + partners 5-cards = 9 tricks = 3 level. With a weak hand and 4 trumps you can jump to the 3 level pre-emptively.
