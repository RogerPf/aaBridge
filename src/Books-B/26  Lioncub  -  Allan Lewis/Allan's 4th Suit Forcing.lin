You may have a 5-card major and would like to know if partner has 3 card support. |pg||at|

Or you may need to know if partner has stoppers in the 4th (unbid) suit before bidding 3NT. |pg||at|

In order to elicit information from your partner use FOURTH SUIT FORCING. |pg||at|

2@d is artificial and forcing for one round. Opener's rebids, in order of priority, are: |pg||at|

After FSF, use the order of priorities as shown way back on page one. The bid should be 2@h. Partner now bids 4@h knowing that his @hAx faces a 6-card suit, and avoiding the inferior contract of 3NT.|sk||mb|2hp4hppp|0
