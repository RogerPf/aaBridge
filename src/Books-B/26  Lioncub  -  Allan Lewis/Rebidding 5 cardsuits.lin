However as responder, there sometimes is a problem bidding a major over partner's opening bid of a minor. If you have a 5-card suit, then you should be able to tell partner this with your next bid.|pg||at|

Let us start with the premise of bidding all 4-card suits up the line.

Now, when you bid a second suit at the 2 level, you guarantee that your first bid suit is a 5 carder.|pg||nt||ht|g|at|Examples are :-
^-{|fa|y|ia|o1C1S1N!2D|cs|2|at|}

^-This promises 5 Spades and 4 Diamonds. With 4 of each you would have bid Diamonds first.

^-
This promises 5 Hearts. With only 4 hearts, you would either rebid  1NT or support Diamonds.|pg||at|

It therefore follows that a rebid will probably show a 6-card suit.|pg||at|

This explanation is by no means comprehensive, but as a general principle try to avoid rebidding a suit with only a 5-carder.|0
