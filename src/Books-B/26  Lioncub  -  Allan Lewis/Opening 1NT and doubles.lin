^-
{|pg||ia|1np2dp2hppx|at|}
^-
The double shows shortage in hearts (2 at the most) and 10 points plus. It will of course, hold a 4-card Spade suit.|pg||at|

This concept of using doubles to show shortage is winning bridge. You may have a few disasters in getting it right, but it is worth persevering with your favourite partner.|pg||nt||ht|f|cs|3|at|^*uOver artificial bids^*n

Nearly always a response of 2@c/@d/@h/@s will be an artificial bid showing a Stayman inquiry or beginning a Transfer sequence.|pg||at|

Use the double here to show real interest in the suit bid (with points of course)|pg||at|

Example

The double will be showing a GOOD Diamond suit (not something like Kxxxx)|pg||at|
^-^*b
Use the double sparingly, and only use it to show a good suit.|pg||nt||ht|f|cs|3|at|When your partner opens 1NT, the same principle applies. Doubles show values and shortage in suit bid.

Answer is Double. This is assuming that the 2@h bid is natural.|pg||nt||ht|f|cs|3|at|What if the overcaller makes a conventional call?|pg||at|

2@c/@d-Artificial. Cappalletti maybe.
 
Double would show some values in the suit bid, and ability to double one of the suits shown by implication.|pg||at|

2@c doubled would just show 9 points plus.|pg||at|

2@d doubled would show one (or more) of the majors, and minimum of 9 points.|pg||at|

Partner will double their major when bid with 4 cards in the suit, or pass if holding less. You should now have some idea of what action next to take.|pg||nt||ht|f|cs|3|at|Try this one

Double from you shows maximum points, shortage in Hearts, and guaranteeing 4-card Spade suit.|pg||at|

How about this one?

What is the doubler's hand?|pg||at|

MUST show about 6/7 points and shortage in Hearts.|pg||nt||ht|f|at|You must use discipline with these bids, and only use them with the quoted set of circumstances. These doubles I hope you will notice are all IN THE FIRST INSTANCE for take-out. Subsequent doubles are penalty.|pg||at|
 

An important lesson here is: -
^-
Sometimes the hand belongs to the opponents even if the points are slightly in your favour.

Using these guidelines will help you compete when the situation arises.|pg||at|

Finally, these suggestions are for a regular partnership, and require agreement beforehand.
