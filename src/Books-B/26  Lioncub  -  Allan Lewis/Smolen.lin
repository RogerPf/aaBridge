Partner has opened 1NT and we hold 5/5 in the majors with enough points to bid game. How do we show partner we hold 5/5 ?|pg||at|

The use of transfer bids is the answer.|pg||at|

Over 1NT you will bid 2@h and partner will complete the transfer with 2@s. You now will bid 3@h. 
This will tell partner you have 5-card Heart suit as well as a 5-card Spade suit.|pg||at|

How will partner know that the 3@h shows a 5-card suit and not a 4-card suit?|pg||at|

Would that sequence not show 5/4 as well as 5/5?|pg||at|

Answer is NO. Providing you use Smolen.|pg||nt||ht|e|at|
Used over 1NT to show a game going hand with 5/4 in the majors.|pg||at|

Over partner's 1NT opening bid you start a ^*bStayman^*n sequence to see if you can find a 4-card fit in his hand for one of your majors.|pg||at|

Surprise, surprise.......He answers 2@d showing no 4-card major.|pg||at|

Now let us find out if there is a 5/3 fit in the majors.  You now bid as follows:-|pg||at|

Jump in the suit that has four cards.

^-With 5@h and 4@S you jump to 3@S|pg||at|
With 5@s and 4@H you jump to 3@H|pg||at|
^-
The reason for doing this is to enable partner (with the stronger hand) to play the hand, keeping his hand hidden.|pg||at|

Your partner will now make the choice of whether to play in 3NT or 4 of the major. With 3-card support he will bid 4 of the major. With doubleton in the major, he will bid 3NT|pg||at|
