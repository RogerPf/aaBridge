3d|3|nt||bg|1|bt||cm|Y|mn|Stayman|tu|1|ht|g|cs|2|at|Your partner has opened 1NT. This shows 15-17 points. (If playing 12-14 then make necessary adjustments). |pg||at|

Hands play better with a 4/4 fit in the majors than in NT. This is because of the ability to ruff with one of the hands. You will be sure of at least one more trick than playing in NT.|pg||at|

However, if your hand is 4/3/3/3 then you will not be able to use a trump to ruff anything. After 3 rounds in a suit, the cards will all be gone. Therefore never use Stayman with this shape hand.|pg||cs|4|at|

The {Stayman} convention allows you to find a 4/4 fit in Hearts or Spades.|pg||at|

A Bid of 2@c asks partner to show his 4-card Major.|pg||at|

Openers Responses:-

^i2@d --- No 4-card major
^i2@h --- 4-card Heart suit. May also have 4 Spades.
^i2@s --- 4-card Spade suit. Denies 4 Hearts.|pg||nt||ht|g|at|How many points do you need to use Stayman?|pg||at|

If you bid 2@c and partner bids 2@d, what action can you next take?|pg||at|

If your hand is flat, ie no 5-card major, with 8 - 9 HCP's you have to bid 2NT. This sequence is invitational, asking partner to bid 3NT if maximum for his 1NT bid.|pg||at|

Of course if you as responder hold 10+ HCP then you immediately bid 3NT.|pg||at|

It is for this reason that you have to have a good 8 or 9 points to use Stayman with a flat hand.|pg||nt||ht|f|at|Hands with 5/4 in the majors|pg||at|

With a hand containing 5-cards in one of the majors and 4-cards in the other, you can use Stayman with very much less than 8 points. |pg||at|There is no lower limit in points. |pg||at|

After the bidding sequence 1NT-2@c-2@d-?|pg||at|

Bidding your 5-card major will be to play and is not invitational.|pg||at|

This follows the same reasoning that with a weak hand with just a 5-card major would use a transfer bid to play in that suit. The hand is likely to make more tricks in the suit than if left in 1NT.|pg||at|

If not playing Smolen, stronger hands of 10+ do not use Stayman. You show the shape of your hand by using a transfer bid into your 5-card suit, and then bidding your 4-card suit.|pg||nt||ht|g|at|There is one scenario where there is no perfect sequence.|pg||at|

This is when you hold 5 of one major and 4 of the other with say 8/9 points.|pg||at| 

The hand is not strong enough to insist on game, only able to invite.|pg||at|

Therefore if you bid 2@c and partner responds 2@d, you have to decide whether to play in 2 of the major with 5 cards, or to invite with a bid of 2NT (ignoring trying to find a 5/3 fit in a major). |pg||at|

Let's take a look at some examples.|pg||st||ah|Stayman|nt|

After hearing your partner open 1NT (15-17 balanced), what do you bid with the following hands|pg||nt||ah|Example 1|md|3Sk976Haj52D965C73|mb|1np?|lb|*bWhat call with this hand?^^2c^|mb|2c|an|Do you have a 4 card major?|at|A Stayman inquiry is used with this hand. |pg||at| 

Continuations in your bidding will differ depending on your partners response. |pg||at|

If partner denys a 4 card major with 2@d|mb|p2d|an|No 4 card major|pg||at| you bid 2NT, inviting game. |mb|p2nt|an|Invitational to game|pg||nt||ub|3|at|
If partner shows a major fit then invite by bidding 3 of the suit. |mb|2hp3h|pg||ub|3|mb|2sp3s|pg||at|

Note the small doubleton club. Partner will be able to ruff the 3rd round.|hs|sc|pg||rh||ah|Stayman|ah|Example 2|nt||ls|sc|md|3Sk984Haq4D764C642|mb|1np|lb|*bWhat call with this hand?^^2n|mb|2n|an|Invitational|at|
An invitational 2NT. 

This hand is 4/3/3/3 so you don't use Stayman.|pg||nt||rh||ah|Stayman|ah|Example 3|md|3Sk9642Ha65D753C64|mb|1np|lb|*bWhat call with this hand?^^2h|at|
Bid 2@h demanding partner bids 2@s which you will pass.|mb|2h|an|5+@s|pg||rh||ah|Stayman|ah|Example 4|nt||md|3Sk9654Ha764Dq6C54|mb|1np|lb|*bWhat call do you make?^^2c|at|A Stayman enquiry is correct here. |mb|2c|an|4 card Major?|pg||nt|
If partner responds with either major an invitational bid in the suit can be made. |pg||at|

If partner is inconsiderate enough to reply 2@d you have a choice. |mb|p2d|an|No 4 card major|pg||mb|p2s|an|To Play|at|Either bid 2@s which is to play, |pg||ub||at|or invite with 2NT (suppressing the desire to find a 5-3 spade fit)|pg||rh||ah|Stayman|ah|Example 5|nt||md|3Sk742H9Da96432C87|mb|1np|lb|*bWhat call do you make^^2c|at|Stayman looking for a @s fit is correct. |mb|2C|pg||at|If Partner then bids 2@d,|mb|p2d|pg||at| or 2@s you will happily pass.|ub||mb|2spp|pg||at| But what if partner shows 4@h?|ub|3|mb|2hp|pg||lb|*bWhat now?^^3d|nt|You bid 3@d.
