1) Has no defensive cards in the enemy suit(s).

2) Has no other good bid to make. |pg||at|

When do you use a negative double, and how do you know it is NOT meant as a penalty double? |pg||at|

You hear partner open. Opposition bid a suit. You double. This is saying to partner:- |pg||at|

a) I have not got the enemy suit held. |pg||at|
b) I do not have 3-cards in support for your major, |pg||at|
c) I do have 4 cards in the other major (hearts) if one major has been mentioned (spades). Or 4 cards in each of the majors, if neither have been mentioned so far. |pg||at|
d) I do have a minimum of 6 points at the one level, or a minimum of 8/9 points at the two level. There is no upper limit. You show extra strength with subsequent bidding.  |pg||at|
e) I have not got any other good bid to make. This is because the opposition has prevented me making the bid I would have made had they not intervened. |pg||at|

^-Let's look at some hands.|pg||nt||tu||cs|2|at|Your partner opens the bidding and your rho overcalls. What can you bid with each of the following hands?

The bidding goes
^j{Partner ^mRHO ^oYou
^j1@h ^m2@c ^o?}|cs|3|at|

You hold
^l{@s Kxxx
^l@h Jx
^l@d AQxx
^l@c xxx}|pg||at|

You can't double for penalty.|pg||at|

You can't bid NT without a club stopper.|pg||at|

You can't support partner with only two hearts.|pg||at|

You can't bid 2@s, as this would show a 5 card suit. |pg||at|

This then is the perfect hand for using the negative double.|pg||nt||tu||cs|2|at|Your partner opens the bidding and your rho overcalls. What can you bid with each of the following hands?

Here you can't raise partner as he may only hold a three cards suit. Again use the negative double to tell partner about your four card heart holding.|pg||nt||tu||cs|2|at|Your partner opens the bidding and your rho overcalls. What can you bid with each of the following hands?

You may have thought the bid should be 1@h as it would have been your natural bid over 1@d. BUT a bid of double is the bid to make. This shows both of the majors, whereas a bid of 1@h would deny holding spades as well as hearts.|pg||nt||tu||cs|2|at|Your partner opens the bidding and your rho overcalls.

My recommendation is to bid 1@s and NOT double.|pg||at|

You may prefer to play this response of 1@s to show a 5-card suit. Many partnerships play that way.|pg||at|

My reasoning is that a negative double should only be used when there is not a natural bid available.  Without the intervention you would bid 1@s, and you can still do so now without taking up extra bidding space.  However as long as both you and your partner agree, play whichever you feel happiest.|pg||nt|So What if the opposition bid a suit and I WANT to double (for penalty). What can I do? |pg||cs|2|at|

Your partner opens the bidding and your rho overcalls. 

The bidding goes
^j{Partner ^mRHO ^oYou
^j1@h ^m1@s ^o?}|cs|3|at|

You hold
^l{@s AKJxx
^l@h xx
^l@d KJx
^l@c xxx}|pg||at|

You can't double, as this would be a negative double showing 8+ points in the minors. You PASS knowing partner MUST bid again. |pg||at|

Why must he? |pg||at|

In order to protect your hand that wanted to double.|pg||at|

You hope he re-opens with a double (for take-out, see below). This you would now convert to a penalty double by passing.|pg||nt|
Low level doubles are always for take-out if the doubler's partner has not spoken. |pg||cs|2|at|

For example. 

The bidding goes
^j{Partner ^mRHO ^oYou ^qLHO
^j1@h ^m1@s ^oPass ^qPass
^j Dbl}|cs|3|at|

|pg||at|This is for take out OR is a reopening double. You must make this double in order to protect partner's hand that may have wanted to double for penalty (see hand above).|pg||at|

We as responder to the opener know partner has five hearts (assuming SAYC or 2/1). Rather than just competing with two hearts, he is telling you he is very short in spades (2 maximum) and has support for the minors.

Possibly 1/5/4/3 shape.|pg||nt||at|
If responder has bid, then all subsequent doubles are for penalties.|pg||cs|2|at|

Example

The bidding goes
^j{Partner ^mRHO ^oYou ^qLHO
^j1@h ^mPass ^o1NT ^qPass
^jPass ^m2@h ^oPass ^qPass
^j Dbl}|cs|3|at|

|pg||at|This double is for penalty, as partner has limted his holding with his bid of 1NT.|pg||nt|N.B. When a hand has doubled a major for take-out

^*B^-He Guarentees a four card holding in the other major.|pg||cs|3|at|
^-^*n
There are two exceptions to this rule.

1. He has a hand with at least 17 points and a very good suit of his own (let me show you a hand). 
^-{|ih|sxhxxdakqjxxxcakx|at|}
^-Opposition open the bidding 1@h, you double... Because you are strong enough to bid 5@d if partner bids 4@s. He will KNOW you have this hand and not fight you.|pg||at|

Change the hand a little and leave out the @cK
^-{|ih|sxhxxdakqjxxxcaxx|at|}
^-You are not now strong enough to bid 5@d over 4@s. The ONLY bid you can make over 1@h without that extra king is 2@d (assuming you are playing Weak Jump Overcalls of course). You are too strong for 3@d. |pg||at|

2. Or he has a hand with more than a minimum, but only 3 cards in the other major, BUT he will hold 2 of the top 3 honours. Playing in a 4/3 fit will be no disaster.|
