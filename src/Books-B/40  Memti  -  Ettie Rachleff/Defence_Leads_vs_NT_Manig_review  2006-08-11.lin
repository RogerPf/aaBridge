at|This is Mani's (MANIG) review of Ettie's (MEMTI) "Leads versus NT" teaching tourney held on Friday, August 11th 2006. 

All hands are NT contracts. 

You, as defender, have to take the lead and plan the defence.

After the board is explained, you can try and play each hand yourself.|pg||bm||

|pg||
at|Q: A@s for unblocking?
A: You lead A from at least A K Q 10 x
Q: K@s asking for unblock?
A: NO, king does not ask for unblok... King always for attitude.|pg||

nt|4th from longest and strongest. Remember you have no entry... so lead 5 and hope partner will get in later and play a @s for you and you get 4 tricks in @s and 1 from partner. Many a times you have to give 1 trick to get 3-4 for your side, so lead 4th best and strongest and longest. I would lead 4th here even if I had A Q J x x.|pg||
nt|Q: This is only on NT?

A: Yes. In suit with AK most start with ace and that promises king and asks for attitude.|pg||
nt|Q: Wish I know what attitude is.

A: Attitude is if you like the opening lead. So if you are in a suit contract, partner lead ace and you want to ruff = you like it, you tell your partner and he will continue with king and then give you your ruff. As I said in NT you give a trick to generate 3-4 so you lead 4th best.|pg||
nt|Q: Does West give count to partner's opening lead?

A: NO, you give attitude on openig lead. There are certain 1-2 exceptions.... Most times you give attitude in opening leads.|pg||

nt|Your lead?
|pg||
at|Q: @h2?
A: Was not @h bid by West the declarer?
Here you have to think... @h is out... @s was bid by dummy... and in general in NTs suit bid by dummy is NOT a good lead unless you have a solid sequence so @s is out.|pg||
nt|So by process of elimination... you come up with @D lead... So which @D to lead?
K: I led @h9 and we set.
A: On @h lead declarer knoks out @hA and gets 5c + 3h + 1s = 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|DJ|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
nt|OK, @DJ is the right card, because you are unblocking in advance for your partner... You hope partner has 4-5 @ds and @DK or @DQ.|pg||
pc|d6|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
sk|S|
at| So here on @dJ partner will signal with...?|pg||
pc|D9|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
at| @D9, the highest he can afford = attitude...|pg||
sk||
at| and declarer will have to win @DK. And later when South get in with @HA he play a @d to @DA and @d back beats the contract.|
pc|DK|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|pg||
nt|So key in this hand... lead of 
1) unbid suit...
2) advance unblok...
3)THINK... Each hand is different so think what partner may have and then you find the right card and here it was @DJ.|pg||
nt|Q: @dJ middle up down?
A: This is not MUD... MUD is with xxx, three little cards. MUD is NEVER a good lead in NT.
Q: Do you use MUD?
A: In general, MUD is very poor choice of lead... Most good players lead low from 3 in suit and high in NT = no interior in that suit.|pg||

nt|Your lead?
|pg||
at|
Q: @c5?
A: @c5 is not good with @cQ J 10 5... Any time you have 3 cards in sequence headed by at least 10 you lead top of sequence. So @cQ or any other suit?|pg||
nt|Q: Doesn't top of sequence take precedence?
A: Not necessarily. In this hand... something did NOT happen... So you know what that is?
|pg||
at|K: No Stayman.
A: Right. So you should think a major suit lead vs @CQ ... and decide.|pg||
nt|K: @s, a longer suit.
A: Yes, @s is longer but not stronger... And as I said no Stayman... tilts the lead to @s6.
So because Stayman did not happen, @s6 is a better choice than very tempting @cQ. Sometimes it's not easy... The key is THINK... A lot of time something NOT happing gives you a clue.|

nt|What does East have to play?|pg||
sk||
pc|SK|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
at| East puts in @SK and now declarer can duck @s two times... and hope @DA is in East. But NO... West has @DA and 3NT is down.|pg||
nt|See what happens with @CQ lead...|

at| Declarer can duck one time or win it...|pg||
pc|DQ|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
at| Knock @DA out and get his 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|Q: So, what we know from skipping Stayman?
A: When Stayman not happens, declarer's side is generally likely to be weak in one major at least.
So see, things are not automatic... To become better, think... If some thing looks good, as here @CQ, think more and you may find a better choice.|pg||
nt|Q: Is it normal for North with 8 pts to go 3NT directly?
A: No... But North's hand is not 8... It's closer to 9.5 points because of Q J 10  and  K J 10 9 x. With 9.5 points 3NT is very good bid. Remember, a lot of times 10/9 when in with other honor give you tricks.|pg||

nt|Your lead?
|pg||
at|K: Skipped Stayman, @h3.
A: Remember my old saying: strongest and longest. Is that right here? If not, why?
|pg||
at|K: Only clue we have is no Stayman used.
A: Right, no Stayman... So @h or @s?|pg||
nt|What else you see in the North's hand?|pg||
at| One thing you see... really is what you dont see... and that is partner has a lot of vaues... So because of likely a lot of values in partner's hand here you hope to beat from his side...|pg||
pc|S9|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
nt|So lead @S9.|
sk|S|pg||
at| Here partner will apply rule of 11... and then see that 9 is a top card... and he will switch to @HQ (dummy's weak) and his strong.|pg||
sk||
nt|But here many will lead @h... which seems right... and as I said only clue you have: no Stayman and weak hand to lead from... and you hope @S9 is better than @H3.
K: Any lead but @h sets this.|pg||
nt|Q: Lead weak suit?
A: No, in general DONT lead weak suit... Here the clue to lead weak is that you are weak and partner is strong and you hope he finds the right switch in time.|pg||

nt|Your lead?
|pg||
at| How about @S or @d, unbid suit?
|pg||
at|
@S is not a good choice as partner may have overcalled 1@s if he had 5 in @s and decent suit. Any thought on @D?|pg||
nt|K: @c lead, East can hope to cash some clubs after cashing @HA - also North made a minor bid.
A: OK, @C is the lead so... @CQ or any other card?
|pg||
at|Question... how many minor cards do you think declarer should have in this bidding?
|pg|| 
at|K: Less than 4 @Hs and less than 4 in @S, so say 11 - 6 = 7.|pg||
nt|A: OK... He did not bid 1@s and did not raise @H... so he would have EXACTLY 7 cards in minors... most times. So if has 7... then how many of those in @Cs?
|pg||
at|He is likely to have 4, but 5 is possible (but not likely). He will not have 3 in @C as then we would have 4 in @d and then he would start wit 1@d, not 1@c.|pg||
nt|Good... so you figured out declarer's hand. So if he has at least 4 in @c... which @Cs?
|pg||
at|K: At least 1 honour for his bid.

See... if he has 4, then @cQ lead will cost you...|pg||
pc|C4|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
at| So you lead 4@c and hope partner has @CK or @C9.|
sk||pg||
nt|@C4 is your 4th and declarer will be left with 5-6-7 etc. 
So again... you see you have to think... THINK...... and if you think you may find a solution. But believe me most of us will lead @CQ here... Only real Experts (not BBO type like me) will find @C4 hehe.|pg||

nt|Your lead?
|pg||
at|K: @H7.
A: @H7 is very wrong.
K: 2NT... both majors and @d support, so...2@c.
A: @c2 is very, very wrong. If you want to keep your partner... @H lead is a MUST.|pg||
nt|When partner overcalls a suit ... he has 5 ... and you MUST lead his suit unless you have very, very strong suit of your own or may maybe a stiff. So as I said @H7 is wrong... so anyone for @HQ or @H4?|pg||
nt|K: If there is an agreement in partnership, lead the highest card in @H = Q. You wish to unblock the suit if partner has 5 cards.
A: Anytmime you have 3 in partner's suit you must lead LOW... as it tells him that you have length. Q from Qxx is wrong... don't make that very wrong agreement.|pg||

at| Declarer puts in @HJ... and contract is down.|pg||
nt|Q: @H4 promises an honor?
A: @H4 does not promise an honor. You lead @H4 even from @H6 5 4. @H4 tells partner that you are likely to have 3 cards in his suit. Better info than none at all.|pg||
nt|Q: From 3 cards always lead small?
A: Only time you lead high from 3 cards is if you had supported before... so partner knows. Else as I said low from 3... even with 764 lead 4. In defence if you tell your partner your likely length, you are ahaed.|pg||
nt|Q: When do you lead top of nothing?
A: You can lead top if partner has NOT bid the suit.|pg||
