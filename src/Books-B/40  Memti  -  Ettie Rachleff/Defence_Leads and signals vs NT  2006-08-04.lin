nt|Better conceal. A point to make: Some time you have no reason to show count. You have nothing, and giving count will help declarer only.|pg||
at| It is imortant for West to play @d2, wrong count, showing odd number, on purpose, as it will be of no value to give correct count.|pg||

pc|D2|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|pc|D5|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
nt|Do you duck?|pg||
at| If South has 3 in @D you can't defeat, so assume he has doubleton. You can't stop it if you duck first trick in dummy. But declarer isn't to know there is Kx doubleton with East. If declarer lead the jack though, he might as well duck and hope.|pg||
pc|D4|se|CARDPLAY.WAV|
nt|Most of us are scared to duck with doubleton, me included.
A good player says: "If I don't duck, they make". You want to defeat, and it's only chance. Go for it! Only think when you being wise guy: DO NOT HESITATE.|
pg||
