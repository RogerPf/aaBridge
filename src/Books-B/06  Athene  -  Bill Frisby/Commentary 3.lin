nt|^*bMM:^*n This set of deals was created in 2007

This hand is from the 1993 England-Wales Camrose match.  6@C was ambitious.  7@C was much more so, given that East was a passed hand!|

nt|In the 1992 women's Olympiad, Maria Erhardt for Austria opened 6@D with the East hand.  South led the @CA but Erhardt could ruff and take a ruffing finesse against the @CK.  This was the only lead to give the contract.|

nt|In the 1991 Cap Gemini, Branco-Chagas were North-South on this hand against Chemla-Mari of France.  Chemla led a club.  Chagas took @CAK and a club ruff.  Now cashing the @DA would have revealed the position, so he left the @DAQ in dummy and ran all the trumps.  Chemla, not knowing the position, bared the @SK.|

nt|This hand is from the 1961 Bermuda Bowl.  E-W were Schenken-Leventritt for the USA; N-S Avarelli-Belladonna for Italy.  East led a club and West put up the @CK.  The @SK was ducked.  Declarer played two rounds of hearts then led a diamond to the @DJ and @DQ.  East cashed the major-suit aces then exited with a heart (!) letting the contract make.  In the other room the USA North went for 800 in 1@CX.|

nt|This hand is from the England-Uruguay match in the 1980 Olympiad.  A heart was led and the contract made.  In the other room, East made a more sensible 5@D overcall.  This was doubled and let through with an overtrick!  (The opening lead was a spade, and North continued spades on winning the @HA.)|

nt|This was the last board of the 1996 ladies Olympiad quarter-final.  Britain were 3 imps ahead against Austria and just needed a flat board.  North led the @cQ and 3NT made with a combined 18 HCP.  A red-suit lead would have been 4 down.  This was enough to give Austria a win.|

nt|This board is from the Egypt-USA match in the 1991 world championship.  4@DX would have made, but declarer lost trump control in 4@SX and went for 1400.  A 2-suiter such as the North hand rarely plays well in the shorter suit.|

nt|This is a famous hand from the France-USA match in the 1986 Olympiad.  Hamman had to guess which ace to lead - he choose the heart and declarer had no problem bringing home the grand slam, with the trumps marked on the bidding.  In the other room, E-W played in 6@SX-1.  France gained 19 imps and went on to win the title.|
