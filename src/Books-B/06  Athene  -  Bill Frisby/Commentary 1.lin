nt|^*bMM:^*n This set of deals was created in 2007

East is entitled to bid again with extreme shape.  The Michaels cue-bid is sensible enough even with the suit disparity, but if the spades and clubs were reversed, it would be better to overcall in spades directly, as it would then be most unlikely that East would ever want to play in clubs.|

nt|West's double just shows a strong hand - it's not purely for penalties, as he can't have a trump stack.  He doubles because if East has a defensive hand for 3@S, then 4@D could easily be 500 or 800 with 4@S not certain to make!  However, as it happens, East has no useful defensive cards and bidding 4@S is sensible.|

nt|East can't double 3@H (even though it would be penalties) because his partner could have a very weak hand.  However, after the re-opening double, showing a strong 2NT bid, he is happy to pass!|

nt|After opponents bid two suits, there's only one possible 2-suiter to show - 2NT is simply the 2 unbid suits!  If North-South went on to 4@S, East would have to decide whether to "take the push" to 5@D, but they are not likely to, given the vulnerability.|

nt|North doubles to show a strong hand.  Over 3@S it's a close decision whether to pass or go on to game.  South is likely to have nothing useful so pass is reasonable.|

nt|Michaels cue-bids can be used over higher openings.  Over a weak pre-emptive bid, of course, the overcall shows a very good hand.  Here, responder could try 3NT, but 4NT (asking for partner's minor) seems reasonable.|

nt|The Michaels cue-bid here shows at least 5-5 in the majors.  East should have a reasonable hand but he doesn't need massive strength because it's worth pushing a little to make sure of finding the best fit.|

nt|In the passout seat, a cue-bid is still Michaels, but a 2NT bid is normally used to show a strong balanced hand (about 19-21 HCP) so here, with a minor two-suiter, East must simply overcall.|

mb|1cp1sp2s3c3s3nppp|
nt|If you want to make a natural overcall in opener's suit, where a direct cue-bid would be Michaels, you must pass and then bid on the next round.  (This is rare in a major, but fairly common in a minor.)  Of course, it shows a good suit.|
