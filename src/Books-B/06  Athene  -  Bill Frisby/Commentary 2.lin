On this hand from the USA-Austria world championship match in 1937, Ely and Jo Culbertson, sitting N-S, had a disastrous bidding misunderstanding.  4@H and 5@D were asking bids.  The auction proceeded similarly in the other room but the Austrian North knew what 5@D was, and 7@S was reached.|

nt|This is a famous hand from the 1931 Culbertson-Lenz match.  East was the young Oswald Jacoby.  It was auctions like this which eventually led to West, Lenz, leaving the match half-way through!|

nt|This hand comes from the Poland-India match in the 1997 Bermuda Bowl.  East had to guess between the red suits.  Eventually he led a heart, playing his partner for a void, and declarer claimed 13 tricks.  In the other room, 4@S was defeated by four rounds of diamonds, leading to a trump promotion!|

nt|This hand comes from the 1988 Pachabo Cup (an English teams event).  4NT was normal Blackwood but North was worried he had overbid so decided to conceal his ace.  Unfortunately his partner assumed he had three aces and bid the grand slam - but West trusted their bidding and sacrificed!|

nt|In the 1993 European championships, this was a critical board in the Sweden-Norway match.  Helness, South, ruffed the diamond lead, cashed the two top trumps then played @CAKJ.  West didn't ruff and Helness discarded a heart from dummy, eventually just losing a trump and two hearts.|

nt|In the 1975 Bermuda Bowl, Eisenberg-Kantar were N-S for the USA here.  East led a diamond and Eisenberg decided to duck.  This would preserve the dummy entry if East held something like @DQ10xx and the spades broke 4-1.  Instead, West returned the suit for an immediate ruff, when declarer had 13 tricks on top all along.|

nt|In the 1992 Olympiad, Estonia suffered a double disaster against the Netherlands on this board.  2@s was a weak pre-empt in any suit, but East didn't see the alert, and assumed his partner's spade bids were artificial.  In the other room, South passed, West opened 4@S and North overcalled 5@C, doubled by East.|

nt|In the 1987 Bermuda Bowl final, England (facing USA) were playing a strong pass bidding system.  1@D showed a weak hand.  East now thought 2@C showed a 2@C opening, but West took it as a normal overcall.  South led a heart.  Declarer could have made 2@C by ruffing a diamond but he played three rounds of trumps.  Now he should have gone down, but North cashed his fourth trump, so eleven tricks were made!  In the other room the English E-W stopped in 5@H, so a big opportunity was lost.|
