^-|
fp|3|cp||ht|d|at|   @2Walddk2 is Roland Wald, best known as BBO's Vugraph Coordinator.  His is the persuasive voice who cajoles and entices experts around the world into showing up at each Vugraph presentation and commentating on the play.  Now leaving Vugraphs behind, he's entering a new phase in life as he moves from Copenhagen to London and is stopping by the BIL Sunday before moving on.

On Sunday, May 23 2010 Roland spent two hours in the BIL to play and discuss random boards with us! Players changed every two boards with members of the BIL Volunteers Team getting the hot seats! He chat to kibs during the play of the hand then addressed the players.

ht|c|cp||fp||at|   @2^z@3Maureen Hall |fp|3|at|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO:

^b· Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.

^b· Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice.

^b· For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily - activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project - the BIL Library - was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

ht|d|cp||fp|3|at|^e@2Roland Wald is Danish/Swedish and, in grand European style, speaks 5 languages fluently - Danish, Swedish, German, Hebrew, and English.  He began his career as a journalist, but bridge has always been his passion.  In fact, he's a Danish Grand Master and the holder of multiple National and Scottish Open titles.

Thanks so much, Roland, for so many Vugraphs that we will never be able to count them all nor will we ever be able to estimate the learning we have gained from your efforts!

Now Roland intends to teach/play Pro Bridge from his new home in London.  Vugraph Roland is articulate, patient, and humorous, which is exactly what real life Roland is like.

Roland will be available for Private Online Lessons for individuals as well as groups - he is happy to teach any level.

Roland can be reached for further information at roland_wald@@hotmail.com or 
075 7028 1862 (+44 75 7028 1862 if you live outside the UK).

Walddk2: My last 5 days in Denmark, moving to London next Saturday...

Since I was a boy it has been my wish to move to London some day.  Blame it on cricket!  Although I was a footballer at Academical Ballclub (AB) in Copenhagen to begin with, I got hooked when I saw all those gentlemen in white clothing.  Cricket it is, they told me, and I was fascinated.  Yes, they play cricket in Denmark, and yes, I got to play for Denmark U20 before I turned to umpiring for about 20 years, but if you really want to deal with cricket, you've got to move to a place like England, South Africa, Pakistan, India or Australia.

As England is much closer to my native country (only a 90-minute flight), it had to be London where Lord's Cricket Ground, aka the Home of Cricket, is located.  I have been to London an estimated 40 times, but I did not live there yet.

An additional incitement is the English language, spoken by Englishmen I'd like to emphasize!  I think it's fair to say that I have three passions in life: cricket, bridge and languages.  No, women are no longer among them, but you never know what happens :).|pg||bm||

mb|1D|fp|3|at| North: Think I'm too strong for 2D here. Singleton S makes me like my hand.
 Walddk2: @2North's opening is perhaps a little light, but it's quite normal nowadays.
I do not recommend 2@D. Pre-empts should not contain 2 aces imo.
|pg||
mb|p1H|
at|The 1@H response is wrong, though. Always bid your longer suit first.
|pg||
mb|p2Dp2S|
at|Now South is in a spot of trouble. North will think she has 5 hearts and 4 spades, and rightly so.
|pg||
mb|p3Hp3Nppp|
pc|C4|
at|Once North opens, it's very difficult to stay out of game. However, 3NT has chances. Look at the diamond layout. It's very favourable for declarer.|pg||
pc|CT|pc|CJ|pc|C5|
nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2South could have won @CK, played a diamond to the queen, then ace and another to set up the suit. Then South would have had 9 tricks: 1 spade, 2 hearts, 5 diamonds and 1 club. It's wrong to hold up as South did, and I'll tell you why later when the players can see it.

sc||pf||sk||pn||
nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2Not a happy start for N-S :). Let's look at what went wrong.
|pg||
mb|1D|at|North's opening first. I very much agree with 1@D. This hand is too good for a pre-emptive 2@D, first of all because a pre-empt should not contain 2 aces.
|pg||
mb|p1H|
at|The response, however... |pg||
ub||mb|1s|at|Always respond in your longer suit first. If 4-4, then 1@H is correct, but with 5-4 the response should be 1@S. Then you, conveniently, show 5-4 later when you rebid 2@H. The bottom line is that when possible always bid your longer suit first. 
|pg||
at|It's not always possible. Say you have a 7 count with 4 spades and 6 clubs and partner opens 1@H. Then you will have to bid your 4-card suit because you are not strong enough to show the club suit. That's different. At the 1-level you don't have such problems with both majors.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2The bidding should go...
|
mb|p2D|pg||mb|p2h|an|forcing|
at|New suit by an unpassed responder is always forcing.
|pg||
mb|p3dp3Nppp|
at|Responder showed 5-4 in the majors after the 2@H rebid.
|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Student: After 2@H is 2NT an option?
 Walddk2: @2I would not recommend 2NT by opener over 2@H because that should promise a club stopper. 1083 is not exactly a stopper :). @0
|pg||
at| Student: South can be five-five in Majors, correct?
 Walddk2: Correct. But then we will bid 3@H over 3@D to show just that.
|pg||
at| Student: What about 3@h over 2@h?
 Walddk2: Good question. If you support actively, you guarantee a fit. So 3@H promises 4 hearts.
|pg||
at| Student: Could North bid 4@H thinking South has 5 hearts?
 Walddk2: Yes, I would have thought South had shown 5 hearts and 4 spades the way he bid.|pg||
nt||fp|3|pc|C4|at| Walddk2: @2Anyway, eventually they reached 3NT which is a very thin game.
West's club lead was natural as it was the only unbid suit. |pg||
pc|CT|pc|CJ|
at|So it went small to East's jack and .......|pg||
pc|C5|at| Do you all see what happened next?
|pg||
at|You have probably heard and/or read about hold-up play. When the opponents lead a suit you can only stop once. However, that only applies to the ace, because that will always score later. With the king, you are in big trouble if you hold up because LHO might have led from the ace as was the case here. Then your @CK will never score a trick.|pg||
up|1|pc|cK|at| So the certain chance of scoring a club trick is to win at trick 1. If you don't, you might never get one club trick.
|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2As a matter of fact, this contract is cold because of the favourable diamond layout. The play should go:

pc|d7d5dQd4|pg||
pc|dAd8s2d6|pg||
pc|dTdJs8dK|pg||
at|The defence can only take 3 club tricks from here and we have 9: 1 spade, 2 hearts, 5 diamonds (@HA is an entry to cash the last three diamonds), and @CK.|pg||

|pg||
at| North: 2@H freebid is a big bid and I don't feel my hand is up for that so I'll promise @H and see what p bids.

nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2I liked the auction until South bid again over 2@D. First, the 1NT rebid showed 12-14 balanced which South had.
Does that also promise a spade stopper? |pg||
at|I would say not. Ideally, it does, but the world is not ideal. Sometimes you are stuck and must rebid 1NT even without a spade stopper.
|pg||
at|OK, now North retreated to 2@D. That is a weak bid, telling partner that 2@D is probably a better contract than 1NT, and opener should pass. @0
 South: Agree.
|pg||
mb|p2Nppp|
at| Walddk2: @22@D has a chance although the trump break is rather awkward. 2NT, however, is not a great contract and would have been even worse if West had led @SQ rather than 4th best. @0
|at| West: And West knew it :(.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2With QJxxx  there is a case for leading small. With QJ9xxx experts recommend that you lead an honour.

|pg||
at| Student: North a Bergen hand if you play it?
 Walddk2: @2Possible, yes. 2@S is a slight underbid but not by much. Anyway, South had enough to bid again and chose a game trial bid, 3@D. Also known as a help suit trial bid. |mb|p3d|pg||

ub|3|nt||fp|3|at| Student: What would South bid if North had bid Bergen?
 Walddk2: @2South would have raised to 4@S over Bergen.

nt||fp|3|at| Student: Can you tell me how the North hand evaluates, the stronger Bergen bid?
 Walddk2: @2If you treat the North hand as limit, the Bergen raise is 3@D, around 10-12. But if you play it reverse, you bid 3@C to show the same, and then 3@D replaces 3@C @0

|at| Walddk2: @2Would you like to know why I (and many experts with me) recommend to play it reversed? Because opener may be interested in game opposite a limit raise, not so often opposite 5-9. If you bid 3@D as the limit raise, opener only has 3@H available as a game try. If you bid 3@C, however, he also has 3@D available as a game try. Do you see?|pg||

at| Walddk2: @2How should you plan the play?
Start by counting losers. You have a certain club loser. You have a heart loser, unless ... Diamonds are OK. 
Trump suit now: You don't know. Sometimes it can be played for no loser and sometimes you have one or two.
|pg||
at|Here is a piece of advice for you: Pretend the worst case scenario, that you have two losers. Then you can't afford to have a red suit loser. Can we do anything about that?|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2Yes, we can. We have two diamonds in the dummy and four in hand with KQ. So on @DQ we can discard the losing heart, just like South did.

South's double... Do you all know what that double is supposed to mean? @0
|pg||at| Students: DONT / Support for unbid suits / Penalty? / 2 suited hand / I would take it as heart takeout.
|pg||
at| Walddk2: @2DONT does not apply in this position. It only applies over a 1NT *opening*.
I'll tell you what the double shows. 
There is only one suit bid, right? So the double is a takeout double of that suit. The shape should be something like 4144, 4153, 4135, 4243, 4234 or better. Always short in the suit opened and support for all unbid suits.|pg||

nt||fp|3|at| Student: @2I am still wondering about the heart play. You said East should lead first low toward @hA. If East wins the @cA in hand, does East go to @cJ to lead first heart through? @0
|at| Walddk2: @2If they are 3-3, you will always make 4 tricks, agree? You play a heart to the ace and a low from hand intending to insert an honour if South follows small. @0
|at| Student: Just wondering how East gets there twice.
 Walddk2: East has an entry in clubs, and only needs one.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Student: On trick 3, no need for South to play the @d9 as @d6 was higher than declarer's @d4 and dummy had 10 4?
 Walddk2: @2Right. The 6 was enough to force the 10.

(Miksa: You can see any trick played pointing with the mouse to the declarer's played cards) @0

 Walddk2: @2OK, and the lead. On this auction I think it's fine to lead 4th best from your longest and strongest. Spade is also an option, hoping that partner has some goodies there, but I would also select a low club, I think.|pg||

nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: @2Yes, as it is, slam is on. But as I said to kibs during the auction, do not feel bad about it if you stop short. It's not a great slam, it just happens to make on this layout. @0
 South: Couldn't get to 33 with my hand.
|pg||
at| Walddk2: A few words about the bidding perhaps. Should North rebid 2@H or 2@S (reverse)?
|pg||
at| Students: 2@S.
 North: If SAYC, 2@s; if 2/1, 2@h imo.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Walddk2: It's not too rich on high cards, but it has a lot of playing strength.
|pg||
at| East: If there's no fit, hard to count points for a void.
 Walddk2: @2Correct, but do you agree that North's hand is much better after a 2@C response than it would have been after 2@D? That's why a reverse is not out of the question. I think 2@S would be fine, but I don't mind 2@H.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Student: But even if 2@H is bid I think South could bid 3@D?
 Walddk2: @2Maybe, but I would just raise to game. It very much depends on whether you play standard or 2/1. If 2@C is game-forcing (2/1), then you can take it easy. It's different if 2@C is not game-forcing (standard). @0
|at| South: We play 2/1.
 Walddk2: If you play 2/1, South could just have bid 3@H over 2@H if was interested in slam.
 North: If South has 4 @ss she'll bid 2@s and I'll go nuts! :).
 South: Still, with a limit rebid, I couldn't get to 33, but 3@h does give us a chance.|pg||
nt||fp|3|at| Student: After a splinter in @s?
 Student: No, you need 4 trump support for splinter.
|pg||
at|
 Student: Would an Exclusion KCB bid by North (5@D) work? .... or, is that not correct here?
 Walddk2: @2I don't think that North hand warrants any Exclusion RKCB. It's not *that* good.
|pg||
at|
Not a lot to the play with @CQ on and the suit 3-2. EW can only score @HA.
