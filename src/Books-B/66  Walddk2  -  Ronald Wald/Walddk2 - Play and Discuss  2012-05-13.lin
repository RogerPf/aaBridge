^b@2Roland Wald aka Mr Vugraph coordinator and commentator.

Roland began his career as a journalist, but bridge has always been his passion. He is a Danish Grand Master and the holder of multiple National and Scottish Open titles.
As a Cricket lover (a game he has umpired 20+ years) and admirer of the English language (spoken by an Englishman), Roland moved to England in 2010.
In 2011 he received international recognition from the IBPA and was awarded the|cp|2|at| Alan Truscott Memorial Award|cp||at|. 

For 21 years Roland managed a successful Bridge Center in his native Denmark.  Currently Roland is working on his second book (the title at the moment is "The BBO Files") which will be published sometime in 2012.  His first book was published in 1991 (only available in Danish).

Roland enjoys teaching and has more than 30 years of experience teaching bridge professionally.  He provides lessons for any level, from beginners to experienced players, at reasonable rates.  
He may be contacted at:  |cp|2|at|roland_wald@ hotmail.com|cp||at| or on BBO and Skype as |cp|2|at|Walddk2|cp||at|

On 13th May 2012 the BIL welcomed Roland for another Play-and-Discuss session.  

The following presentation has the 7 boards played including Roland's valuable comments on both the bidding and play and more.
  
Many thanks to the BIL Founder, Maureen Hall, who made this possible.

So 2 down this is, mercifully undoubled :)
Interesting first hand this
I agree with 1@C, the longer suit first
1NT is also fine, and so is 2@H (transfer)|
pg||NT||at|
Now
Burloak doubled this to show a side suit in hearts
She has, but it's better to bid 3@H to show five of them
then you will have shown 6 clubs at the same time|pg||nt||at|
Now back to double of 2@H
syllabub, when a transfer bid has been doubled, it's normal to pass with a doubleton spade and only bid 2@S with 3 or more

BabsG did not like to bid 3@H over 2@S, understandably perhaps 
but after the 4@s I don't think Babs should get involved
Hope that 4@S goes down, which it will, losing 2 clubs and 2 spades|pg||nt||at|
Finally
when 5@C comes back to you, syllabub, double it. You can't imagine that it will make
They need 11 tricks, and that looks impossible from your point of view,
particularly after your partner showed some life when she invited game|pg||nt||at|
Questions?
masse24: And if you have that agreement (Pass after Double showing 2 @S's)...."Pass" must be alerted?
Walddk2: Yes, North will correct to spades after syllabub passes,
or if you have a partnership agreement, redouble, that asks partner to complete the transfer
(to make the strong hand declarer).
Can we move on?|pg||nt||

^b{ New Gadget for Major Raises: }|fp|1|ht|f|cs|3|at|
^b@2Partner opens 1 of a Major, say 1@s

- With a 4+ spade support and 12+ HCP use ^*uJacoby 2NT^*n

but:

- with 4+ spade support, 9-11 HCP and a singleton: Use ^*u3NT^*n           


{1@s - 3NT       3NT = 4+ spade support, 9-11 HCP and an unspecified singleton}|fp|1|ht|n|cs|3|at|


1@S  ^e4@C/@D/@H    9-11, 4+ spades, showing a ^*uvoid^*n in the suit bid

Now after 3NT ......
If opener is interested in knowing about the singleton, she bids 4@C:
1@s    ^e3NT
4@c   ^e4@D = singleton diamond
        ^e4@H = singleton heart
        ^e4@S = singleton club!!

In other words if opener is not interested, responder has not revealed her singleton

And what if partner opens 1@h?
|pg||nt||
bt||
fp|1|cp|2|cs|3|at|

^b@21@h

{ 1@h - 3@s   =  unspecified singleton (4+ @h support and 9-11HCP) }|fp|1|ht|e|cs|3|at|

And now, with 3NT opener asks where (if interested):
1@h ^e3@s
3NT  ^e4@c = clubs
^e4@D = diamonds
^e4@H = spades!!

and finally .......


1@h - 3NT  ^f^*uvoid^*n in @s
1@h - 4@C/@D   ^f^*uvoid^*n in the suit bid

When you use this splinter method you must have 9-11 HCP
Stronger hands go through Jacoby 2NT!
Many advantages .....You can differentiate between singletons and voids right away, and ....
Opener does not have to ask for the singleton if she is not interested in slam.
Therefore the defender will have a blind lead not knowing where the shortage is.

It does not have a name
You may call it Roland's splinters if you like :)
But I am not the one who devised them

mandm2: what about a Bergen raise here?
Walddk2: You can use Bergen if you don't use 'mine'
I prefer 'mine',  9-11 hand with a shortage is strong enough to force to game.|pg||nt||

Usually 6-6 in the majors
That would have made it impossible for EW to bid the club slam
And a very good 6@c it is.
Should they have bid it now?|pg||nt||at|

Not so easy, but easier if EW play splinters
Do you, tjtoo?|pg||nt||at|

tjtoo: yes...I play splinters.
Walddk2: 1@C   3@S
Your hand is enormous when partner opens 1@C
My partners open 1@S when I have a hand like yours
tjtoo: I never thought about using a splinter bid after the 1@c...
Walddk2: I see|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: if don211 gets a splinter in 3@S, he will steer this to 6@C I think
As it is, even with the @SA wasted... and yet it is a very good slam.
It's a laydown, you cash one round of trumps to see if they are 1-1
when they are 2-0, you still have enough trumps to ruff all diamond losers
and only lose 1 trick to the @CK|pg||nt||at|

I don't think any other pair uses the Gitmoss gadget

Walddk2: Maybe over 2@C, you can bid 2NT rattray
which is not necessarily diamonds and hearts, the two lowest unbid suits,
but merely 2 places to play.
That's a normal agreement among experts
If partner bids diamonds, you correct to 3@H hence showing both majors

Getting to game on modest values
the hands fit very well
I agree with Ian84's double although it is quite light with the singleton @HK
Maybe 2 wee ones should have jumped to 3@S.  2@S does not really promise values after the redouble.
It is merely a preference and can be a very weak hand.|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: After a 3@S it may not be so easy for N-S,
as Karen10 would not have room to show a feature in clubs below game level anymore.
Odyssee1:  XX correct ?
Walddk2: Redouble is fine with me
I dont envisage game I must confess, but as it is, game rolls in easily enough
Ian84 bid a little too much, you told your story with your first double, don't bid 3@S...
and don't double 4@H|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: You have no reason to think that this is going down.
The heart suit is interesting in 4@H, 10 cards without KJx
There are two ways of playing the suit:
cash @HA if the King is singleton, then no loser.
Another way of avoiding a loser is to advance @HQ|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: hoping that East started with Kx and West with the singleton Jack
which the Queen will pin.
What is the percentage play do you think?|pg||nt||at|
Odds are 2:1 for cashing the Ace. Why?
Because it wins with singleton King in EITHER hand
advancing the Queen only with singleton Jack in WEST's hand|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: makes sense? Questions?
Isabelle10:  is north too strong to open a weak 2?
Walddk2: No
Karen10: LTC = 7 (with 6 I would be more carefull)
Walddk2: Fine 2@H vulnerable, I would also open 2@H non-vul
it is not good enough for 1@H
Some say you should have at least two top honours when opening a weak 2|pg||nt||at|

Then you may have to wait forever

well done!
However, 4@S may go down in practice, losing 1 spade, 1 heart and 2 clubs
Should West open 1@S, 4@S or 2@C?
2 wee ones: almost opened 4
Walddk2: Too good for 4@S|pg||nt||at|
Karen10: 2@c?
Walddk2: Yes, 3-loser hand. Not unreasonable to open 2@C
either 22+ hcp or likely game in own hand.
This is not a 2-suiter, 7-4 is a one-suiter.
What do you call AKQ10752?
Trumps!
mandm2: A Mother's Day gift
|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: Now, to the play in 5@D
Odyssee1, When you discover that that trumps are 4-0, do not play any more trumps.
Start setting up your side suit, clubs.
And use the remaining trumps in hand to ruff clubs.
Then you only go 1 down
Finally, 2 wee ones did very well as a defender|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: If West had not continued spades after the Ace
the contract can be made.
It can't after another spade. Well done 2 wee ones!|pg||nt||at|
You can play the hand Double dummy if you wish, the lead was the @hAce

Walddk2: OK, down it went.
mandm2, you have a very ordinary opening...
mandm2: yes
Walddk2: 13 HCP, 4-3-3-3  and Aceless
don't bid again over 3@C, which is non-forcing
In fact, pass 2@C, as 2NT shows game-interest, which you don't have.|pg||nt||at|
mandm2: I considered bidding 2H over the 2C
Walddk2: That is possible, 2@H that is
But trust partner to know what he is doing,
he knows you can have 3 clubs, therefore, club support should promise 5|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: dmac5?
You know declarer can get to the clubs with @HA there, right?
dmac5:  y|pg||nt||at|
Walddk2: So win the @CA earlier and don't make your partner make too many discards,
Lead a diamond through
The @d8 must have been from length.
She doubled 1@C and you know she has a singleton club when she plays the Jack|pg||nt||at|
Now 
What about the lead against 3NT?  (sallyally chose the @d8)
diamond or spade? Both could work
sallyally:  unbid suit?
Walddk2: yes, so you went for the unbid suit, fair enough
and it is also good enough to defeat 3NT
N-S should have stopped in a part-score in hearts or clubs|pg||nt||at|
moviemaker: due to undo's the table got messed up here, and Roland called it a day,
promissing an extra 15 minutes next time :) 

Walddk2: Lets call it a day then
I hope you enjoyed it anyway and that you got a few points
Bye for now|pg||nt||
