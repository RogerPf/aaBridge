zaXXon: Hi people, welcome! Nice to meet you again :)
For those of you who are joining me for the first time - my name is Zahari, or just Harry :) 
and I'll be glad to spend a few hours with you, talking about our favorite game.
Today: Secure your Contract|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
Every declarer hates to go down. 
And the feeling is even worse, when the contract could have been made but went down due to a miss guess or due to 
the wrong choice in your line of play. 
But the feeling is even worse, when the contract was cold but declarer failed to find the 100% line. 
That is why, every good player loves to secure his contracts every time this is possible.
The target is easy to be described - making the contract against all possible distributions, avoiding any risk or guess
while not taking in account possible overtricks.
To be clear - this is applicable mostly for IMPs scoring of course, not for MPs,
 ...but still some examples should be played a certain way, no matter what kind of scoring it is.

How to proceed?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|
1. First, as always, you have to count your tricks and possible losers.
From here we go to:
2A. Enough tricks - your target now becomes to limit your losers to a specific number.
Most common question in such deals is     "What could go wrong?" 
and you should plan your campaign to cover such possibilities.
Or:
2B. You need one or a few more tricks. Then you have to look for a sure way to find the needed number, 
covering most or all possible cases.
Once again, you should ask yourself "What is the worst that could happen to me?" and prevent, if possible.

Too many words - lets see what I'm talking about!

MM: Though during the sessions Harry took al 4 seats, in this presentation you will be South
Quiz questions are added and at the end of each hand you will have the option to replay "Double Dummy"
(all 4 hands shown, where you can click the cards to play, where you can try a different line as well)

If West has 4 clubs (East being singleton), you can't give a heart...
because a club ruff will be their 4th trick. (2@d  1@h  and a club ruff)
You can establish clubs
... but you can't draw trumps, because you need them as entry to your established clubs.

If you come up with the Ace, you

BUT|

up|1|pc|sj|at|
If you play the @sJ then you    a)   make if finesse works     or     b) make because you can ruff
This is called "safe finesse"   because it's always a positive outcome, whether the finesse works or not :)|

No @h- losers on this lead.|

4 @s (at least) 3 @h after the lead, 2 @d + @cA = 10
Well, the @sAK will drop or not, that doesn't depend on our play
But the @c-loser could be discarded on third diamond, true?
