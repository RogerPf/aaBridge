For example you may have the King and 2 small ones in the dummy, with 3 small ones in your hand. You try to keep the hand off lead that can lead through the King.

Of course sometimes you cannot help it, but if there is a choice of which way to finesse in a suit, then you should play with this in mind.|

pg| ***** 4 ***** |

The lead of the 10 marks North with the other top cards in the suit. You can tell this as South did not have a higher card to play. If South had the Ace or the Queen, he would have played it.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hc|dk|nt|Therefore you must try to keep South out of the lead. Once he gets in, he will play a Diamond through your remaining honour and the contract will fail. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |

However you don't mind North winning a trick, as he cannot profitable play another Diamond without giving you another trick. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


lc|dk|hs|wcec|nt|You will need club tricks to make this contract, and you cannot keep South out of the lead if he has the Ace, so just hope that North holds it.|

Therefore play a small club at trick 2. Lo and behold, North pops up with the ace. |
