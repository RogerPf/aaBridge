The most important single move that you must make before playing out a hand is to count your tricks. That seems easy enough, doesn't it? |

Lets take a simple example: 
^-{   DUMMY
@s A 4 3

YOU
@s K 5 2}
^-
Whenever you play a bridge hand as declarer, you get to see all of your partner's cards before you play. Your partner's hand is called the dummy, and that term has nothing to do with the way he may have bid his hand. 

So what you do after the opponent on your left makes an opening lead is to look at one suit at a time; look, for example, at your spades and at dummy's spades and count the number of sure tricks you have in that suit. Then you go through the same process in each suit and come up with a figure. That is a very important figure. It tells you how many tricks you can take at a moment's notice. Remember that term, sure tricks, because we are going to work with it for a while. 
|

Now let's go back to our example. In dummy we have the A 4 3 of spades, and in our own hand we have the K 5 2. The ace will take one trick and the king will take another, so we have the two sure spade tricks. |

Counting tricks has its hazards. Let's try this one: 

^-{DUMMY
@sK Q

YOU
@sA 2}
^-
Now how many sure tricks do you have in spades?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

This answer is two, not three. You see, when you play a card from your hand, you must also take a card from the dummy. Let's say you play the ace; then the queen must be played from dummy. That leaves you with the two in your hand and the king in dummy. In other words, you have two tricks, not three. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

The important thing to see is that you can never take more tricks in a suit than there are cards in the longer of the two hands. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|Look: 
^-{DUMMY
@sA K Q

YOU
@sJ 10}
^-
Between you and your dummy you have the ace, king, queen, jack, and ten. But you can only take three tricks. That is because the dummy, which is the longer hand in spades, has only three cards. |

@0|ht|l|at|^g@2(b) Four tricks. Now this situation and the following ones are a little different because you do not have the same number of cards on both sides. In this case the dummy has four and you only have two. As a general rule, whenever you have a bunch of good tricks in a suit that is unevenly divided, you should play the high card(s) from the short side first.
@0This means playing the king, which will take the eight from dummy, and then leading your seven over to the ace, queen, and jack in dummy. When cards are high it does not matter which one you play first. In this case, when you have played the king and are about to lead the seven over to the dummy, it doesn't matter if you play the jack, queen, or ace; they are all the same. In this little game we are playing, we are always assuming that the opponents have led some other suit and we have taken the trick. Now we are about to play our suit. Sometimes the trick we have taken will have been in dummy. Therefore, if the lead is in the dummy, we must play the eight of spades over to our king and then the seven back to the dummy. But in either case we are playing the high card from the short side first. |

We would play the four over to the ace (or jack), then the jack, and then the three over to our king and queen.

{ESTABLISHING TRICKS}

In most of the deals that you play, you never seem to have enough sure tricks to make your contract. Let's say you are playing three notrump. You need nine tricks to fulfill your contract, and you usually count up only five or six sure tricks. What are you going to do? Well, there is another method of getting tricks, but it involves a little work. You have to establish, or make, tricks for yourself. Study this diagram: |cs|3|at|

ht|k|at|^f@2If this is your spade suit, you do not have a sure trick in spades. But if you were to play the king (or the queen or jack) from dummy and drive out the ace, you could establish two spade tricks for yourself. This method of establishing tricks, driving out the opponents' aces and kings, is the most common method of obtaining tricks in bridge.

You may be wondering what would happen if the opponents did not take their ace; actually, it would turn out the same. Let's say you lead the king and everyone plays low. Well, you've taken one trick already. Now you lead the queen. If everyone plays low again, you have taken two tricks in the suit, and that is all you ever had coming in the first place. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||cs|3|at|
When it comes to establishing tricks, you follow the same general rule that you did when you were taking your sure tricks. Play the high card(s) from the short side first. For example:

If the opponent takes it with the ace, you will still have the deuce, and the next time it is your lead you can take the queen, jack, and ten. In other words, you should get three tricks from this suit.

You are now ready to make a little progress. Your next step in planning the play of a contract is to count the sure tricks you have and see how many more tricks you can establish. 

The important thing to remember is to keep the two counts separate until you have actually established some tricks. Once you establish some tricks, you can add the tricks you have established to your sure trick count. Take a look at this layout:

ht|i|at|^e@2Let's say you are playing a contract of six notrump. You must always ask yourself how many tricks you need to make your contract. In this case you need twelve (six plus your bid). The opponents lead the queen of spades. Now, after realizing how many tricks you need, which is really the first step, you must add up your sure tricks. So let's do that. You have two in spades, four in diamonds, and three in clubs. A total of nine. Notice that you did not count even one sure trick in hearts, simply because you cannot take a trick in that suit until you drive out the ace. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|

Well, you have nine sure tricks and you must establish at least three more tricks in hearts to make your contract. That's easy enough. You simply win the spade with your king and lead a heart. Let's assume that the opponents take it with their ace. @0Your sure trick count has just changed. You now have twelve sure tricks instead of nine, because you can add those extra three heart tricks to your total once the ace has been removed. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|

Now for the most important point in the whole lesson. When playing a bridge hand that does not have enough sure tricks, you must establish extra tricks. Establishing extra tricks should be the first thing you do. You establish the extra tricks you need before you take your sure tricks. Then, when you have established enough tricks to make your contract, you take all of your tricks at once. |

st||nt|Rules are not much good unless you know their reasons. So we are going to go back to our six notrump contract. For the first time we are going to look at all four hands.

For concealment, declarer usually plays his highest equal, or highest in a sequence, first. So you would first lead the queen of hearts. In this case you must give up the lead twice in hearts in order to establish two tricks of your own in the suit. Assume that the queen loses to the king or ace and that a spade is returned. You take this in the dummy and lead another heart, establishing your hearts before taking any of your sure tricks. |

(6) When playing equal cards (such as the jack, ten, and nine), declarer should usually play his highest equal first. This applies to both establishing and taking. By doing this, you make it harder for the opponents to know what is going on. If you have the ace, king, and queen of spades and you play the queen, naturally it will take the trick, but your opponents will know that you still have the king and ace. However, if you play the ace first, the opponents will not know who has the king and queen. 
When playing equal cards from the dummy, it doesn't matter which one you play first, because the opponents can see the dummy. However, just to stay in practice, you should take the highest equal from dummy also. |
