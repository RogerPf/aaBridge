nt||cs|3|tu||at|Leads in a NT contract.

If you are leading from a position over the strong hand ( the opening 1NT bidder for example) BEWARE of leading from tenace holdings. The dangerous suits to lead from are those with:-

^h{AQ10}  or  {KJxx}  or  {KQx}

With these holdings sit back and wait for your tricks. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

^l{10xx^*ux^*n}

The better choice is to lead from a weak suit such as 4 cards to the 10.

This may be finessing partner….BUT he was in a finessable position anyway, so no great damage will have been done.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

With a good suit say 

  {^*uK^*nQJ10xx}, 

then you should be making an attacking lead.  Here the King is the correct lead.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cs|3|at|The same applies from any suit containing a sequence of 3 cards.

A sequence is a 3-card unbroken sequence. Very often you have a suit with a broken sequence which should also be your choice in deciding a lead.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

Broken sequences come in 2 varieties:

1. ^c@2A holding where there is a break after the first 2 cards before the sequence is continued.

  {^*uA^*nKJ10(x)}  or  {^*uK^*nQ10x(x)}  or  {^*uQ^*nJ9x(x)}

Note; there may be more than 4 cards in the suit.  Here the lead again is the top card in the suit. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |

2. ^c@2A holding where there is a break after the first card in the sequence.

     {K^*uJ^*n10x}  or  {Q^*u10^*n9x}
@0
OR
^c@2Missing 2 cards

     {A^*uJ^*n10x}  or  {K^*u10^*n98}  or  {Q^*u9^*n8x}

Here the lead is the top of the interior sequence.  
@0
These leads from broken sequences are an integral part of attacking bridge. You are hoping partner has 1 or more of the missing cards, in order to establish the suit.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|If the strength is split between the 2 opps hands, then lead from your longest suit UNLESS it is a suit bid by them.

Again the lead is the 4th highest card,  UNLESS the suit is headed by a sequence of 3 cards, in which case you lead the top card.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||cs|3|at|Leads against a suit contract

Similar in some respects to the leads against NT.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

Lead partner's suit. 

Leads will be the same. Again beware of leading from tenaces over the strong hand. 

Leads from suits with honours are however, now different. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

Always lead the higher of 2 touching honours, and never the 4th highest as shown in the examples above.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at| 

Never lead from unsupported kings, and never underlead an ace. However, a lead of an honour from an unbid major is very often correct. This is usually when the opps have steered clear of a NT contract.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at| 

From a holding of 3 small, I favour the lowest card. 

From my experience this nearly always pays dividends, as declarer will place you with a missing honour card, or expect you to hold a 4-card suit.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|
Unless it can possibly be avoided do not lead from top of a doubleton.^*n
|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |

If you can get into the habit of NOT doing this, then partner should be able to recognise that the lead is from a singleton, and will give you an immediate ruff.

Therefore with a singleton, lead it.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
 

If you have a good trump holding do NOT lead a short suit. You do not want to ruff and shorten your trumps. You want to be able to force declarer, so lead your longest suit.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|


In the absence of anything better, it is often best to lead a trump.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

However never lead from a holding of Jx or Qx. Very often partner will have Qxx, or Jxx opposite your lead and so giving declarer a present of no losers.

Never lead a singleton trump.|
