^-Let's take a closer look at question 3.
Where can I develop more?
^-|ht|e|at|A) ^c{KQx} ^f@2This holding in a suit will provide at least one trick after losing one to the Ace. It may provide two tricks if you lead towards it twice and the ace is in the hand in front of the KQ combination. @0|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ht|i|at|B) ^c{xxx}

^bopposite 

^c{AKxx} |ht|i|at|^f@2This will provide three tricks if the suit breaks 3/3. Ace and then King and then a third round which will lose. The last card will be a winner. However be aware that this is against the odds. Holding 7 cards between you, the suit will normally break 4/2. Look up the book on the odds of distribution, and learn the most frequent ones.

ht|q|at|C) ^c{xxx}

^bopposite 

^c{AKxxx} |ht|q|at|^f@2Similarly this will usually provide four tricks if the suit breaks 3/2 (which is normal). If dummy holds AKxxx and no other entry. You hold xxx. How will you play the suit? It is no use playing Ace, King and another. You will hasve no entry to cash the last two winners. The solution  is to duck the first round, and take the second round with the Ace. You have given up what must be  at least one loser in the suit at an early stage rather than a later one, in order to retain control.  Variations of this theme occur very often. |

^-|ht|e|at|D) ^c@2Potential tricks are available from a finesse. Other tricks may be available from playing towards a Queen from an unguarded Ace, you hope the King is in front of the Queen. @0|

E) ^c@2Extra tricks are also available in a Trump contract by ruffing losers BEFORE drawing trumps. However, always draw trumps unless you need to use them. @0|
