^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #182 - March 6, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal took place during the second last match of the Forbo Teams Final at the recent ^*B8th Forbo International Bridge Tournament^*N in Scheveningen, The Netherlands. Complete coverage of this event, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N is available through:

While the Nations Cup is considered the main attraction of the Forbo tournament (the host Dutch team won this year), the Forbo Teams always boasts a strong and large field. The field in this year's Forbo Teams was particularly impressive as it included several top international teams as well most of the top players in Holland. We are happy to report that a team representing Canada that included our friends Drew Cannell, John Carruthers, Eric Kokish and George Mittelman emerged as the winners of this very tough event.

This week's deal took  place when Canada faced some of Poland's top players (Jassem-Tuszynski and Gawrys-Pszczola) towards the end of the Forbo Teams. The Canadians won this critical match 41-3 in IMPs, partly on the strength of their 10 IMP gain on this week's deal. The play at both tables was quite interesting and will be shown here. In both cases the deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. Make sure you read all the way to the end of this week's deal as there is a fun exercise you can try at the end.

If you are involved in running a bridge tournament and would like to see an ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N presentation of your event, please e-mail ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N for more information.

nt|In the Open Room (with the deal rotated) Carruthers made the same 1NT opening as Tuszynski, but Gawrys-Pszczola use double to show the majors (among other possible hand types). This made it convenient for Cannell to suggest a penalty with his redouble and Carruthers was charmed to double Pszczola's runout to 2@D. Gawrys made a disciplined pass and 2@D doubled became the final contract.|

nt|Do you think that Gawrys would have done better to run from 2@D doubled? Suppose he had decided to redouble for rescue. Pszczola surely would have bid 2@S and Cannell surely would have doubled when 2@S came around to him. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|ws|at|Just as surely Carruthers would have led a trump. |

nt|We are not sure how 2@S would have fared against best defense. You can do some experimenting of your own. Use your mouse to select the cards you want to play for all 4 players.
