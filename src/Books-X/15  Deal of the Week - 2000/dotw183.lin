Before you get to play this week's deal you have to bid it. You are South. Both sides are vulnerable and you are dealt the following unimpressive collection of cards:

|ht|e|cs|2|at|^o{|ia|1hd3hppdp3sp4cp?|at|}
|ht|e|cs|3|at|^c{|ih|pST8632H72D832CT54|at|}

West dealt and opened 1@H. Your partner doubled for takeout and East's 3@H was a preemptive raise. This was passed around to your partner who doubled again. You tried 3@S, converted to 4@C by your partner.

|lb|*BWhat call would you make?^^4S|
at|You should bid 4@S. Your partner has shown a very powerful hand with long clubs and without 4 spades. He is very likely to have 3 spades, however. If your partner did not have 3 spades he would have bid 4@C instead of doubling at his second turn.

You may not make 4@C or 4@S (you are going to have to play it well), but if the partnership is to be at the 4-level you might as well be in a contract that offers a game bonus if it succeeds.

West's opening lead is the @HA and dummy puts down about what you would expect. Your contract actually has a reasonable play. Well bid by you!|

Think about how you would continue as declarer before reading on.|

hs|ss|nt|Playing another round of trump is not going to work. East would win the @SQ and force you again in hearts. East would then be left with the only outstanding trump and you would go down at least 1 trick. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|nd|at|The only hope is to play minor suit winners through East in an attempt to neutralize his small trump. Can you think of a layout of the East-West cards that will make this possible?|
