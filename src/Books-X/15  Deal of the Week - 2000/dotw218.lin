^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 218 - November 13, 2000^*N }
^-
Who are the top 5 bridge players in the world? There is really no objective way to answer. We susepct that if you posed this question to a group of the world's most successful tournament players, dozens of names would be mentioned. We also suspect that Norway's ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N would be on almost every list. When you take into account that he is only 30 years old, it becomes clear that ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N is a very special bridge player.

Besides being an incredibly gifted natural player with an outstanding tournament record, Geir is a fascinating character. He comes accross as confident, yet humble. It is obvious he loves playing bridge - his smile and sense of humor are present regardless of the seriousness of the competition. A mystique has grown around the name "Helgemo" - it is almost as if Geir inhabits his own world as a bridge player.

As such, the title of ^*BGeo Tislevoll's^*N recent book:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N }
^-
is most appropriate. Geo, one of Norway's most popular bridge writers, is well qualified to write on this subject. Geo has been a friend and sometimes partner of Geir since 1982. Helgemo was a 12 year old boy at the time - he was at the dawn of his life as a bridge player. Geo has watched as Geir developed into both a man and a great player. His insights into both "Helgemo the player" and "Helgemo the person" make for fascinating reading.

^*BHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N contains many, many deals in which Helgemo's bridge genius is evident. Refreshingly, it even contains a chapter in which some of Geir's blunders are shown! There are several important themes in this book: Geir's ability to get into the minds of his opponents, his wizardry with spot cards, his strong technical skills, his remarkable ability to do the right thing at the table. All of these themes are evident in this week's deal.

This week's deal is sample of what you will find in ^*BHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N. This deal took place many years ago in a small pairs tournament in Trondelag, Norway. Geo and Geir were playing as partners. This deal is mostly about card play, but ^*BHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N also contains chapters on Geir's bidding philosophy as well as insights into what it is like to play in (and win) the toughest events in the world. Geir Helgemo himself co-authored ^*BHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N (published by ^*BFive Aces Books^*N and available through major bridge supply houses). We highly recommend this book to our readers.

nt|After West dealt and passed, Geo, North, opened 3@D at unfavorable vulnerability (you can see the vulnerability displayed above in the top left corner - red is vulnerable, white is not vulnerable). East passed and it was Geir's turn. What call do you think he made as South? Remember, Geir and Geo were playing in a pairs tournament.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Geir make?^^3NT|
mb|3n|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|nt|Geir bid a practical 3NT which became the final contract. While it is true that 6@D might have been a good contract (less likely in Norway where light preempts are common), Geir knew that he could not really find out. He certainly could not investigate 6@D without going above 3NT and playing in 5@D rated to be a disaster at matchpoints. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|Furthermore, Geir suspected that even if 6@D was a good contract, most of the field would play in 3NT. Perhaps Geir and Geo could earn a good matchpoint score if Geir was able to win more tricks than the field in 3NT. You will not be surprised to learn that this is exactly what happened!|

hc|hk|hc|cq|hs|nd|nt|West led the @SQ and Geo put down a reasonable dummy. The diamond suit was not exactly what Geir was hoping for, but Geo's @HK and @CQ provided some compensation. Still, it looked like 3NT could fail if there were 2 diamond losers. |

ls|ss|up|32|
hs|ec|hs|wc|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Geir's play of leading the @CQ from dummy effectively transferred the defensive club guard from East to West. At the same time, getting the @CA out of the South hand was a ^*BVienna Coup^*N, an unblocking play that was required for any squeeze against West to materialize.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


md|0,ck4,,cjt|nt|Are you wondering how Geir knew to lead dummy's @CQ instead of simply cashing the @CA as a "simple" Vienna Coup? After all, Geir's play would fail if West was dealt the @CK instead of the @CJ10. Doesn't that suggest that Geir's play of the @CQ was very much against the odds (as it required 3 cards to be well placed instead of just 1)? |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


up|15|ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|ls|wc|hc|sj|hc|da|hc|dq|nt|If we back up to the start of the deal we can see that Geir's @CQ was clearly correct (again no surprise) despite the anti-percentage feel of this play. At the time of decision Geir knew that West had been dealt the @SQ, @SJ, @DA, and @DQ. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hc|ck|at|If West held the @CK too (making Geir's @CQ play wrong), then West would have opened the bidding.|

lc|ck|lc|sj|lc|da|lc|dq|hs|ec|hs|Wc|nt|The above layout of the club suit was impossible given West's pass in first position. |

md|0,cjt,,ck4|nt|It was possible, however, for West to hold the @CJ and @C10. That is the position that Geir played for and his clever thinking was rewarded. Get yourself a copy of ^*BHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N and you will learn much more about the thinking process of this great player!|

Clicks on the cards you would like to play and use the  ^$6  button on the toolbar below to take back the last card you played. Note that Geir's plays of the @HK, @CQ, and @HA were all needed in order for him to come to 12 tricks.|
