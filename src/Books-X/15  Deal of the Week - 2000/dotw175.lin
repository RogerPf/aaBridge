The Orbis World Bridge Championships are currently taking place at the Southampton Princess Hotel in Bermuda. Full coverage of this event, including online vugraph, is available through:

This week's deal was played during the Bermuda Bowl quarter-final match between Poland and USA II. Poland had a commanding 31 IMP lead when this deal, the 5th last of the match, was played. This deal was the start of one of the most dramatic last minute comebacks in recent memory.

The Deal of the Week usually features a well-played hand, but this deal was all about the bidding. Watch how Americans Zia Mahmood and Michael Rosenberg conducted a beautiful auction to a very difficult slam.|

Looking at all the cards we can see that 6@S is an excellent contract, but getting there is very difficult. It is rare to bid to slam after the opponents open the bidding at the 1-level and balancing auctions are among the hardest in bridge. Can you think of any intelligent way for Zia and Michael to bid to 6@S with confidence?|

lb|*BWhat call did Zia make?^^2D|mb|2d|an|Michaels cuebid|hs|sh|hs|ss|nt|Zia did not have any way to describe his powerful hand so he improvised. His choice of 2@D was a Michaels cuebid suggesting a good hand with at least 5 cards in both major suits! As you can see, Zia did not exactly have the major suit length that his 2@D bid promised. He had a plan, however, and that plan worked brilliantly.|

lb|*BWhat did Michael bid?^^5S|
ls|ss|mb|P|mb|5S|hs|ns|nt|Michael came through by raising Zia to 5@S. Zia's sequence convinced Michael that his heart cards were golden and his trumps were also very strong in the context of the auction. When Nike did their "Be like Mike" campaign we are pretty sure it was Michael Rosenberg, not Michael Jordan, that they were referring to!|
