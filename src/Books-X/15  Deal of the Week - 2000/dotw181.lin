cs|3|at|^-{ ^*BBIG NEWS!!!^*N You get to be the declarer in this week's deal! }
^-
In all previous ^*BDeals of the Week^*N all the user has been able to do is watch the bidding and play take place, read our analysis, and answer the occasional quiz. This week's deal is different. You actually get to play the hand as declarer and you can play the cards in whatever order you want. The deal that you will play is from ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, a highly acclaimed educational software product that was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc^*N. If you enjoy free online bridge content like ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N you can support these efforts by purchasing our software. You can find out more about ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N and download a free demo version through this web site.

^*BBridge Master 2000^*N is similar in many ways to this week's deal. This program presents the user with a series of lesson deals to declare at various levels of difficulty. What makes ^*BBridge Master^*N special is that the program will allow the user to make his contract ^*Bonly^*N if the correct line of play is taken. If the user makes ^*Bany^*N technical error the program will respond by defeating his/her contract. The applet version is not that smart yet and still makes some mistakes. Nonetheless, we think you will enjoy playing this week's deal.
