^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 216 - October 30, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal is one of the rare ^*BDeals of the Week^*N that is more about bidding than card play. Whenever we focus on bidding, the e-mail feedback we receive is mixed. Some readers want to see more bidding discussion and some would prefer if we stuck with card play. Please keep the feedback coming so that we can make sure that nobody is happy all of the time!

^*BGeorge Cuppaidge^*N, of Queensland Australia, sent us this deal in which he and partner, ^*BIshmael (Ish) Del'Monte^*N, conducted a very impressive relay auction. George has been successful in Australia's major events for many years, but Ishmael (originally from New Zealand) is a relative newcomer to these ranks. Ish is still in his 20s, but he is widely considered one of the Australia's best players (as well as one of the top young players in the world).

A relay auction is characterized by one player making the cheapest bid (a relay) whenever it is his turn to bid. His partner responds to these relays by describing his hand in a very structured way. If everything goes according to plan, the relayer will eventually have enough information about his partner's hand to place the final contract with great accuracy. Relay auctions can be remarkably precise, as you will see with this week's deal.

The Australians have played a leading role in the development of relay theory. ^*BRoy Kerr^*N invented the ^*Bsymmetric relay^*N many years ago - an idea that has inspired great Australian players from ^*BDon Evans^*N in the 1960s through ^*BPaul Marston^*N, a world class player and theorist of today.

George Cuppaidge developed the relay system (named ^*BJorj^*N) that he and Ish were using when this week's deal was played. The main advantage that the Jorj system has over most relay systems is that it is relatively easy to learn and remember. The entire Jorj system is described in only 12 pages of system notes - quite a contrast to the several hundred pages that most "complex" systems require. George is eager to share his ideas and talk system with other relay players. If you would like to learn more about Jorj, please e-mail George directly:

at|Designing complex bidding systems can be one of the most stimulating and rewarding parts of bridge. We greatly respect the intellectual achievements of system designers and we believe their claims that artificial systems are often more effective than "natural methods".

As far as we are concerned, that is what "the great debate" in bridge should be all about - the needs of the average player. In our opinion, the game as it is now played at its highest levels is too complex for the vast majority of the world's bridge players to understand.

^*BFred Gitelman^*N, the President of ^*BBridge Base^*N, has a mother who has been playing duplicate bridge for a few years, but played socially back in the 1950s when ^*BCharles Goren^*N was successful at attracting millions of new players to the game. Goren succeeded by making bridge relatively simple for the average person to learn. In those days, even when the game was played at its highest levels, it was simple enough for the average person to understand.

That is not the case anymore. Fred's mom is bright and studious and would love to be able to talk to her son about his experiences in major tournaments. Unfortunately they are not playing the same game anymore. "Modern expert bridge" has become too complex for the average player to have any interest in following.

In our opinion, this has really hurt the game. Bridge is having trouble attracting new players and in holding the interest of those that have already learned to play. Other sports (such as tennis and golf) have been successful partly because the major championships of these sports can be shown to average players (and potential players) on television. The members of the TV audience see these games "at their best" and it all makes sense to them - they play the same games themselves! Not so with bridge. Major corporations are very interested in sponsoring the championship events of most sports. Not bridge. There are enough bridge players in the world to give these companies value for their advertising dollar, but 99% of these cannot possibly follow the game as it is played by experts today.

We do not know the answer to this problem, but we know that it is a problem. It is too late to try to put the genie back in the bottle by completely eliminating artificial bids. A line has to be drawn somewhere. The concept of "the line" may be philosophically unappealling for the lawmakers and system inventors, but, if making bridge more popular is to be a primary goal, then this line must exist (and it has to be drawn in a much different place than where it is right now).

The system makers of the world don't understand and there is a good reason for this. For the most part they are gifted players. As such, they find it close to impossible to imagine that average players could have trouble understanding their brilliant (no sarcasm intended) inventions.

If you are a regular reader of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N chances are that your skills place you in the top 1% of all bridge players in the world. You are likely a natural card player who has studied the game extensively and played in major tournaments for years. As such, it is very hard for you to get into the head of someone from the other 99% - the bridge players out there who do not (and cannot) understand bridge the way that you do. Have a game with your mom sometime. It will not be bridge as you know it. Show her this week's deal. She won't get it.

Our apologies to George Cuppaidge for launching this diatribe when he went to the trouble of sending us a very well bid pair of hands. The Jorj system is quite simple as relay systems go - George goes so far to call it a "natural relay system". We really do admire the accomplishments of the George Cuppaidges of the world. Our fear is that they are going to run out of people to play against before long.

nt|East dealt and passed, and Ish, South, opened 1@D. The Jorg system is essentially a 5-card majors system, but major suit openings are made 1 step below their "natural" place. Ish's 1@D therefore promised 5 or more hearts and 10-19 high card points (2@C, the strong bid in the Jorj system, is used for all hands with 20+ HCP). |

mb|P|mb|1S|
an|10-14 HCP without 4 @Ss|
at|Ish's 1@S response said that he was in the minimum (10-14) range for his opening. By inference Ish was denying 4 spades as he would have opened 2@D with a minimum opening bid including 4 or more cards in both majors. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


mb|P|mb|1N|an|Relay|mb|P|mb|2S|an|10-12 HCP any 5332|
nt|George relayed against with 1NT (notice George never "wastes" a step) and Ish's 2@S showed any 5332 hand with 10-12 HCP. If instead Ish had bid 2@C or 2@D he would have been showing 4 cards in the suit bid. 3@C and 3@D are used to show side 5-card suits. 2@H would show 6 or more hearts. 2@S (10-12) and 2NT (13-14) show 5332 hands. That's about as natural as a relay system can get!|

nt|George relayed with 2NT and Ish's 3@D response showed exactly 3523 shape (3@C for 3532, 3@H for 2533). |

The first step for 10-12 hands (3@S here) would show 0-2 controls. 3NT would show 3 controls, 4@C 4 controls, so Ish's 4@D showed 5 controls.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


lc|hadack|nt|George was now in a position to place the best contract with complete accuracy. He knew that Ish held either his actual hand (shown above) or the same hand with the @HK instead of the @CK. How did he know? There are 12 controls in the deck and 11 of them were accounted for (6 with George, 5 with Ish). Therefore, the partnership must have all 4 Aces and 3 of the 4 Kings.
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|Furthermore, the @SQ must be missing. How did he know this? Ish had shown 10-12 HCP and was already known to have 11 HCP in the form of the @HA, @DA, and either the @HK or @CK. If Ish held the @SQ he would have at least 13 HCP. George knew that 6@S would always be a good bet and that 7@S rated to be poor.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4H|an|Relay|mb|P|mb|4N|an|1 Control card in the majors|hc|ha|nt|George could have signed off in 6@S now, but he decided to keep relaying in order to test how well his partner knew the system! George is actually a nicer partner than this, but this deal did come up in a practice session. Better to get the kinks out of the system there than in the heat of battle... 4@H was a relay and 4NT showed 1 "control card" (the @HA) in the majors.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


mb|P|mb|5C|an|Relay|mb|P|mb|5S|an|1 Control card in each minor|
lc|ha|hc|dack|nt|George relayed a final time with 5@C and Ish bid 5@S to show 1 control card in each of the minors. We are not fully confident that we understand this aspect of the Jorj system, but George still could have asked Ish if he held any Jacks!. Ish could not hold any Queens given the earlier bidding or George could have asked for those too. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


lc|dack|nt|George kindly let his partner off the hook and signed off in 6@S. One of the disadvantages of relay systems is that the declarer's hand has sometimes been completely described during the bidding (as was the case on this deal). On the other hand, sometimes the declarer has done nothing except relay, leaving the defense with almost no idea what the declarer's hand looks like. |mb|P|mb|6S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

West's opening lead was the @C10. Think about how you would play before reading on (but don't think too hard about it if your head is still spinning from the bidding).|
