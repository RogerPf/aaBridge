bt||nt||cs|3|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 213 - October 9, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BKit Woolsey^*N, a two-time World Champion and many time National Champion.  Kit is also an excellent and very successful bridge author as well as one of the leading bridge theorists in the world. It is fun to about bridge with this guy - his knowledge is very deep and his passion for the game is high.

Kit was playing with ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N on ^*BSwan Games Bridge^*N when this week's deal was played. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Swan Games Bridge has only been open for a couple of weeks, but the early indications are that this service is going to a big success. The Swan bridge software is rich is features and we like many aspects of the user interface. There are a few small kinks in the software, but we expect that they will be worked out soon.

Swan Games will be working with some of North America's best players, including Kit Woolsey, ^*BBobby Levin^*N, and ^*BDrew Casen^*N to help with the educational and content aspects of this site. Swan Games Bridge is free so you should definitely have a look. The software is easy to install and can be downloaded through:

Kit didn't do anything brilliant on this deal, but he exhibited the kind of solid technique that has helped to make him such a successful player for such a long time.

pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|2c|ls|ss|ls|nh|hs|wc|at|Fred was all set to jump rebid 2NT when West made a nuisance of himself by coming in with 2@C. What call do you think Fred made?|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|wc|lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^2nt|
mb|2n|nt|Fred bid 2NT anyways. If the vulnerability had been reversed he might have preferred a penalty double. Kit and Fred had not had time to discuss system so they had no agreements concerning either double or 2NT. The best way to survive under these conditions is to assume that if a bid ^*Ican^*N be natural then it ^*Iis^*N natural.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|ec|mb|3c|nt|East raised to 3@C giving Kit a serious problem. What would double by Kit mean (it cannot really be penalty given the auction)? Is 3@D forcing? These are difficult questions even for experienced partnerships. What call do you think Kit made?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|ec|lb|*BWhat call did Kit make?^^3D|mb|3d|hs|sd|nt|Kit chose to bid 3@D. Kit wasn't sure if how Fred would interpret either double or 3@D. On Kit's actual hand he didn't mind if Fred wanted to pass 3@D. The risk in 3@D was that Fred might read this bid as forcing and get the partnership too a poor game contract. As game might not be so poor (and because of he was vulnerable at IMPs) Kit judged that bidding 3@D was the percentage action.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|sd|mb|p|nt|West passed and Fred had another problem (especially as he did not know if 3@D was forcing). What call do you think Fred chose to make?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^3S|
hs|ns|nt|Fred chose to make the slightly obscure bid of 3@S. He had no idea if Kit intended 3@D as forcing, but he did not want to Pass and risk missing a vulnerable game. Why 3@S with only 2-card support instead of 3NT? That was a judgement call. Fred suspected that the hand might play better in a 5-2 spade fit than it would in 3NT. Fred was right about that, but passing 3@D would have been more right!|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|ls|ns|nt|Kit made a disciplined Pass of 3@S which became the final contract. Kit correctly assume that if Fred had a "great hand for spades" (ie similar to his actual hand but with 3-card support) he would be sensitive to the ambiguity of the auction and bid 4@S instead of 3@S. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|Fred later admitted that he was uncertain as to the nature of Kit's 3@D call. Kit then admitted that he wasn't sure either.  If Kit Woolsey has any uncertainty about the meaning of a bid, it is a good bet that nobody really "knows" the answers!|

West's opening lead was the @CK. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|

hs|nc|hs|ss|hs|es|at|By refusing to ruff East's club return Kit was able to maintain trump control (a good move given the 4-2 trump break). Kit didn't mind losing a club trick, along with 2 diamond tricks and a trump trick as long as he kept control. Dummy's @CJ would now prevent the defense from forcing Kit in clubs.|
