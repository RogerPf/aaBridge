^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #199 - July 3, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by Toronto's ^*BGavin Wolpert^*N at a recent game at ^*BDoubles Duplicate Bridge Club^*N. Gavin, who is only 17 years old, is one of the top young players in North America. Gavin was recently awarded the ACBL's ^*BKing or Queen of Bridge Award^*N (King in Gavin's case) for having won the most masterpoints of all ACBL members who are graduating from high school this year.

Gavin is not the only Wolpert to have made his mark on bridge recently. His brother ^*BDarren^*N (aged 28) was a member of the team that won the ^*BCanadian National Team Championships^*N last week in Halifax. Darren and his partner, Jurek Czyzowicz, along with their teammates, Kamel Fergani, Nick L'Ecuyer, Jeff Blond, and Doug Fraser, will represent Canada in the 2001 Tri-country Playoff. This event, between Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda offers a berth to the 2001 Bermuda Bowl as the prize for the winning team.

Congratulations to all of our friends who won the 2000 CNTC - the youngest team to win this event in many years. Darren, Nick, and Jeff have all played for Canada's Junior Team within the past few years.

You definitely will be seeing Gavin play for the Canadian Junior Team for the next several years and we are confident that he will eventually be a CNTC winner himself. His partner for this week's deal is ^*BDavid Grainger^*N, another of Canada's top young stars. As you will see from this week's deal these guys never stop bidding, but they often manage to win enough tricks to justify their aggressive choices in the auction.|

hs|ws|hs|wd|hs|wc|at|Gavin had almost a complete count on the hand. Gavin was assuming that West was dealt 4 spades and he now knew that West also had 4 diamonds. West had followed to 3 times in hearts and had led the @CA. West's only unknown card was either the 13th heart or a club.|

We especially like this deal because declarer has to ruff a winner and then discard a winner on a loser in order to make his contract. Usually in bridge it is the other way around. Nicely played Gavin!|
