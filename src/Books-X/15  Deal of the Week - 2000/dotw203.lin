^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 203 - July 31, 2000^*N }
^-
This is an unusual ^*BDeal of the Week^*N because it does not contain a deal. This week we will be presenting some bidding ideas that we hope you will find interesting. These methods could be added to just about any natural system, but they were designed with ^*B2/1 Game Force^*N in mind. Variations of the methods presented here have been used successfully by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N in his partnerships with ^*BBrad Moss^*N, ^*BGeorge Mittelman^*N, and ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N.

We tried presenting some bidding theory in one prior ^*BDeal of the Week^*N (February 14, 2000 - available through this web site) and received a fairly positive response from our readers. Please let us know your thoughts on this. Would you like to see more (or fewer) ^*BDeals of the Week^*N in which the focus is on the bidding? Please e-mail your comments to:

hs|sd|cs|3|ht|c|at|^M{|ih|psA2h6ct8543dQJ983|at|}

and that East has a minimum hand with good support for diamonds, like the above example.

mb|2d|mb|p|lb|*BWhat call would you make?^^3D|at|Many players make the mistake of passing 2@D in this situation. East should keep the bidding open by raising to 3@D. West still could have quite a good hand, despite his non-forcing 2@D rebid and game (or even slam) is possible. Opposite this 14 HCP hand, for example, 6@D is a big favorite.

So far so good, but the responder could have a much stronger hand, especially playing ^*B2/1 Game Force^*N where the 1NT (forcing) response could me made with as much as 12 HCP. For example:

lb|*BWhat call would you make?^^2s|at|
For many years experts have used responder's 2@S rebid in this auction to suggest a "stronger way to raise diamonds" than a direct 3@D raise. This makes good sense since the 2@S bid is normally idle - responder cannot have long spades or he would have bid 1@S over 1@H. On this particular hand 4@D would be a reasonable altnerative to 2@S, but it is dangerous to go above 3NT (especially playing ^*B2/1 Game Force^*N where opener could be 3532).

|at|Using responder's 2@S rebid here as a strong diamond raise has become very popular, but most partnerships are not getting very good mileage out of this bid. Here is what we suggest:

|cs|2|at|^-{ Use the 2@S rebid to show several possible hand types, most of which are diamond raises. 
 2@s asks the opener to bid 2NT over which the responder can clarify his hand type. }
^-
The concept of 2@S forcing opener to bid 2NT in this auction does not cause any problems in terms of "wrong-siding" the deal for notrump purposes - responder has already bid 1NT.|

ht|m|cs|2|at| { 3@C }    @2^M@3
|ht|m|at|Shows an ^*Iinvitational^*N hand with at least 6 clubs. To ^*Isign of^*N in clubs bid 3@C directly over 2@D. The exact ranges of ^*Iinvitational^*N and ^*Isign off^*N depend on the range of the 1NT response. 
|ht|l|cs|3|ls|sd|hs|sc|at|@0@1^n{|ih|ps654h9cakjt84dkt7|at|}


This example hand (and those that follow) assume that the partnership is playing ^*B2/1 Game Force^*N. In other natural systems the responder would bid 2@C directly over 1@H with this hand. If your system allows a direct 2@C response with less than game forcing values it is less important, but still useful, to differentiate ^*Igood hands^*N with long clubs from ^*Bbad hands^*N with long clubs.

We will soon see what responder can do when his hand is too strong in support of diamonds for the non-forcing sequence described above.

|ht|m|cs|2|at| { 3@H }    @2^M@3

|ht|l|cs|3|hs|sh|at|@0@1^n{|ih|ps7hk7dkjt94cat543|at|}

4@H will often be the best contract when responder holds this hand and the opener's hearts are strong. This sequence will usually place opener in a good position to either select the best game contract or to explore for slam.|

|ht|m|cs|2|at| { 3@S }    @2^M@3
|ht|m|at|Shows a hand that is too strong to follow up with a non-forcing 3@D after 2NT. Responder promises at least 5 diamonds and denies as much as a doubleton honor in hearts (with this he would bid 3@H instead of 3@S).

|ht|l|cs|3|ls|sh|at|@0@1^n{|ih|psa7h5dAjt945cq543|at|}


This sequence tells the opener that responder has just about the best possible hand for diamonds given the initial 1NT response. The bidding is still below 3NT which could easily be the correct contract for East-West.|

Here is a summary of responder's actions after his 2@S rebid forces opener to bid 2NT:

|cs|1|ht|d|at|^-{|ia|1hp1np2dp!2sp!2np?|at|}
^-

|cs|2|at| { 3@C }    @2Shows an ^*Iinvitational^*N hand with at least 6 clubs. To ^*Isign of^*N in clubs bid 3@C directly over 2@D. The exact ranges of ^*Iinvitational^*N and ^*Isign off^*N depend on the range of the 1NT response. 
@0@1
|at| { 3@D }    @2Shows a better raise of diamonds than a direct 3@D over 2@D, but is not forcing. This call strongly suggests at least 5 diamonds, but may be the least-of-evils choice on some hands with only 4-card diamond support.
@0@1
|at| { 3@H }    @2Shows a hand that is too strong to follow up with a non-forcing 3@D after 2NT ^*Band^*N that contains a ^*Idoubleton honor in hearts^*N and ^*Iat least 5-card diamond support^*n.
@0@1
|at| { 3@S }    @2Shows a hand that is too strong to follow up with a non-forcing 3@D after 2NT. Responder promises at least 5 diamonds and denies as much as a doubleton honor in hearts (with this he would bid 3@H instead of 3@S).

The same general idea works when opener's rebid is 2@C instead of 2@D:

|cs|1|ht|d|at|^-{|ia|1hp1np2cp!2sp!2np?|at|}
^-
The main difference here is that responder does not need the 2@S bid to differentiate ^*Igood hands^*N with long diamonds from ^*ibad hands^*N with long diamonds. Responder can simply bid 2@D over 2@C as an attempt to sign off in diamonds and jump to 3@D to suggest long diamonds and a maximum for 1NT.

When the opening bid is 1@S (rather than 1@H) these auctions become much more difficult for responder. It is possible to use various relays in these auctions as well, but only at the expense of some useful natural bids. If the response to this week's presentation is favorable then we will consider publishing more articles along these lines in future ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.
