^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 215 - October 23, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a double dummy problem. We would like to tell you who composed this problem, but we don't know. As you will see shortly, the composer must have been a brilliant analyst. If you have seen this problem before and know who created it, please let us know so that we can give credit where credit is due! 

^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will follow shortly, but first an important announcement:

at|^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N is pleased to announce the release of ^*BBridgeVu^*N, a Windows program that is available for free download through this web site:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Bwww.bridgebase.com/bridgevu^*N }
^-
^*BBridgeVu's^*N function is similar to that of the software that is used to present the ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N.  We use the term ^*Bbridge movie^*N to describe these sorts of presentations and refer to ^*BBridgeVu^*N (as well as the program you are using now) as ^*Bbridge movie viewers^*N.

One of the main advantages of using ^*BBridgeVu^*N to watch bridge movies is that you do not have to be connected to the Internet when you use this program. This is especially nice for those in Europe who have to pay for local phone calls.  ^*BBridgeVu^*N is also prettier and nicer to use than the bridge movie viewer that you are using now.

nt|Your mission is to find a way for South to win 12 tricks against any defense. You should be warned that this is a very difficult problem in terms of discovering the correct solution. The actual solution is relatively easy to understand and is extremely elegant. We just love this deal!

hs|ns|hs|ws|hs|es|nt|The critical moment in this deal has now been reached. One of dummy's high spades must be cashed. The rest of the play will be radically affected by the spots cards that both defenders choose to play to this trick! Suppose first of all that West follows innocently with the @S6. In this case it doesn't matter if East follows with the @S2 or with a middle spade spot.|
