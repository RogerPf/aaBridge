This week's deal is a declarer play problem that came up in the first session of the Final of the Olympiad. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. In this presentation you will be "walked through" the correct play sequence. The reasons why the recommended line is correct are presented at the end of the correct (and winning) line of play.

Congratulations if you found the ^*Bdummy reversal^*N and ^*Bsqueeze^*N against East to make your contract! |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|nd|nt|The recommended line of play is better than the "obvious line" of discarding dummy's diamonds on your hearts with the intention of later ruffing your diamond loser in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|wh|hs|ws|at|The "obvious line" requires hearts 4-3 and will fail on the actual layout as West is able to ruff the third round of hearts. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|nd|hs|ws|ls|ws|hs|eh|md|0,h2,,c4|nt|The recommended line also works when hearts are 4-3 |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|wh|hs|ed|md|0,c4,,h2|at|and on the actual layout where East is dealt heart length along with the @DKQJ. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


md|0,dk,,ck|ls|eh|ls|ed|hs|ec|at|This line also gains when the @CK and @CQ ruff out |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


md|0,dj,,c9|hs|eh|at|or if East guards the 4th round of clubs along with heart length (in this case East will be squeezed in hearts and clubs |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|ed|md|0,ck9,,dkj|at|- a more likely squeeze than the heart-diamond squeeze that existed on the actual layout). |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|eh|hs|wh|hs|wd|nt|Note that either a heart or diamond opening lead by West would have left declarer with no chance on the actual layout. Both of these leads mess up the entries required to complete the dummy reversal and heart-diamond squeeze against East. |
