bt||nt||cs|4|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 214 - October 16, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem that was shown to us by our good friend ^*BBeverly Kraft^*N. Beverly has been a member of Canada's Women's Team for many years. The Canadian Women have always turned in respectable performances at the World Championships, consistently qualifying for the knockout stages and sometimes advancing to the later rounds.

At the recent ^*BWomen's World Teams Olympiad^*N in Maastricht, The Netherlands, the Canadian Women made a breakthough and advanced to the Finals of a World Championship for the first time. Canada eventually lost to the United States in a close match, but we Canadians are still very proud of our team and the Silver Medal that they earned. The strong play of Beverly and her long time partner, ^*BRhoda Habert^*N, contributed greatly to Canada's success. Full coverage of the recent World Championships, including lots of ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is still available through:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*Bwww.bridgeolympiad.nl^*N }
^-
Beverly and husband ^*BEric Kokish^*N are a very dynamic duo. They are both recognized as world class players and Eric is widely thought of as one of the best bridge writers and theorists in the game today (and arguably the best bridge coach in history).

We know better. Beverly is really the brains behind this operation. In all seriousness, Beverly has played an integral role in all of Eric's successes. The top women players rarely get the credit they deserve and the same as true of the women who work in the bridge business (^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N is another example - President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N would be lost without Sheri).|

You, South, are declarer in 6@D. West's 2@D is a Michaels cuebid showing at least 5-5 in the majors. East's 3@S response is preemptive by agreement. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||pc|SK|nt|West's opening lead is the @SK. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. 

Hint: Have your morning coffee (the kind with caffeine) before you read the answer.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


sk||hs|ns|hs|sh|hs|wh|nt|It is reasonable to assume that West has the @HK making the finesse in that suit wrong and leaving you with 3 possible heart losers. One of these can be discarded on dummy's @SA. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|wh|hs|nd|hs|ed|at|You can afford to lose a heart trick, but if you try to ruff your remaining heart loser in the dummy, there is a good chance that the defenders' @DJ will be promoted into the setting trick.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ed|ls|Sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ed|hs|wd|hs|ec|hs|wc|nt|You can get much better odds by trying to establish dummy's clubs, but  the bidding suggests that at least one of the minors is not breaking. Careful timing is required in order to maximize your chances against as many distributions as possible.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ed|ls|wd|ls|ec|ls|wc|hs|ns|hs|sd|nt|The first critical move is to play a low spade from dummy at trick one and win the trick by ruffing in the closed hand (you will see why this is critical much later). |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|sd|pc|s|pc|s|pc|d|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|sc|nt|It would be wrong to draw even 1 round of trump. Start clubs at once by cashing the @CK. |

ls|sc|pc|ck|md|0,dj3hj,,hkc93|hs|wd|hs|sh|hs|eh|at|In the unlikely event that West is void in clubs, he will ruff your @CK and you will need the heart finesse after all. |

ls|nc|ls|sd|pc|c|pc|c|pc|dt|md|0,dj,,d2|hs|wd|at|West can have 1 diamond at the most and, if it is the @DJ, he is welcome to overruff. |

pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|ns|at|West can do no better than to retrurn a spade to dummy's @SA (ruffing in hand is also OK). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|pc|sq|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|h|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|It is safe (but not necessary if West has his bid) to draw 1 round of trump now |

ls|nc|ls|ed|ls|sd|pc|c|pc|D|pc|d|pc|s|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|You can now draw East's last trump with dummy's remaining honor |

pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|Sh|at|and use dummy's last 2 clubs to take care of your 2 remaining heart losers. |

ls|nc|ls|sh|up|17|md|0,d2,,dj|hs|wd|nt|If West's singleton diamond is a small card (instead of the @DJ) the play will continue in a similar manner. |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|Hs|wd|at|and you can now play a diamond to the dummy to draw West's only trump (if West is void in diamonds you will need the heart finesse). |

hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|Ed|at|You will then be able to draw East's last trump in the dummy |

pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|nc|hs|sh|at|and claim an overtrick (dummy's @SA and remaining clubs will take care of all 3 of your heart losers). |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|nc|ls|sh|up|19|hs|wd|md|0,dj,,c9|nt|Suppose now that West was dealt a singleton club and ruffs in when you lead the second round of clubs toward the dummy. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d|pc|c|pc|c|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|ns|hs|sh|at|West's best defense is to return a spade to dummy's @SA as you discard a heart. |

ls|ns|ls|Ws|ls|sh|pc|sq|pc|sa|pc|S|pc|h|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sd|at|You should now ruff a club in the closed hand to establish the suit, but you have to guess whether to ruff with the @DA or with a middle diamond. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|Nc|pc|c|pc|c|hs|sd|hs|wd|nt|If West was dealt the doubleton @DJ it is necessary to ruff with the @DA, |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|Ed|md|0,h3,,dj|at|but if West was dealt 6-5 in the majors with a small singleton diamond it would be fatal to ruff with the @DA (East's @DJxx would be promoted). |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


md|0,d3,,h3|ls|ed|hs|wd|at|If West was dealt a small doubleton in diamonds, it doesn't matter whether you ruff with the @DA or with a middle diamond - the contract will be made in either case. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|sd|up|9|hs|ws|hs|nc|md|0,dj,,d3|nt|Finally, consider the case where West discards on the second round of clubs. You should win  dummy's @CA |

ls|nc|ls|sd|pc|c|pc|c|pc|dt|hs|wd|md|0,h3,,d2|at|If West can overruff with a singleton @DJ the contract will fail (unless East has the @HK). |

hs|nc|Hs|ns|hs|sh|at|You will end up with an overtrick as dummy's @SA and 2 last clubs will take care of all 3 of your heart losers. |

up|19|md|0,s8,,dj|
hs|ws|nt|What if West has 1-1 in the minors and discards on the second round of clubs (we have already shown that you would succeed if West ruffs in this position)? |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s|pc|ca|pc|c|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|We find it remarkable that the contract can no longer be made when West's 6 card suit is spades! Do you understand why it would be fatal for West to ruff in on the above layout?|
up|3|hs|wd|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|D|pc|c|pc|c|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|wh|nt|It is not because West has ruffed a loser for you (which is a bad strategy for the defense on many deals). The reason is that West endplays himself by ruffing the second round of clubs as he has just run out of safe exit cards. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ns|ls|ws|hs|sh|nt|A heart return into your @HAQ takes care of one of your heart losers and the other 2 will go on dummy's @SA and @CA. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|sh|hs|ws|ls|nc|at|A spade return instead does not give up a trick directly, but it does provide an extra entry to the dummy (which is why it is right to ruff West's spade opening lead, preserving dummy's @SA). |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|pc|sq|pc|sa|pc|S|pc|h|

up|27|md|0,h3,,s8|hs|wh|nt|The last variation (we promise) was something that we missed when we first wrote up this week's deal. Thanks to ^*BAndy Lewis^*N for letting us know how declarer can (and should) succeed when West's 6-card major is hearts.  When we first posted this week's deal we claimed (incorrectly) that declarer had no chance against best defense when West was dealt 1-1 in the minors. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


hs|nc|nt|West discards on the second round of clubs (best) as dummy's @CA wins the trick. |

pg| ***** 86 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|eh|at|As Andy Lewis pointed out, South should now cash the @HA! This play cannot cost and, when West started with 5611 distribution, it is necessary to strip East of his singleton heart |

pg| ***** 90 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ed|nt|If trumps had been 2-2, you could claim an overtrick at this point. When East turns up with 3 diamonds the situation looks grim, but a club lead from dummy will still see you home (as long as West's 6-card major was hearts). |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |

hs|es|hs|ns|hs|sh|nt|East has been given a trump trick he was not entitled to, but you will win 2 tricks in return. East, down to just spades, will be forced to lead to dummy's @SA as you discard another heart loser (here is another reason why it was necessary to ruff the spade opening lead). |
