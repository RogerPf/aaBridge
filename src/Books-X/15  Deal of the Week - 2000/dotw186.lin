^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #186 - April 3, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by our friend ^*BBernard Marcoux^*N of Montreal. If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appear as ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N please e-mail all of the details to:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N }
^-
Bernard's main claim to fame is that he is one of the premier French language bridge writers in the world. Bernard has previously been awarded the ^*BBols Prize^*N for the best bridge article of the year by the International Bridge Press Association for his article ^*BA Man About Universe^*N. ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N was the subject of this article (which is available through the ^*BArticles^*N area of this web site). As you will see from this week's deal, Bernard is also a fine player.

Bernard was responsible for translating our ^*BBridge Master^*N software product into French. Additional information on this product is available (in English) through this web site. If you are interested in the French version of ^*BBridge Master^*N and you live in Quebec, please e-mail Bernard:

If you live in France (or anywhere else outside of Quebec) e-mail ^*BPaul Farizy^*N for more information about the French version of ^*BBridge Master^*N:

pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|sd|nt|It appeared that Bernard now had 3 certain trump losers as well as a certain loser in diamonds. Assuming that West was dealt a singleton heart, can you think of any distribution of the East-West cards that would give Bernard a chance to make his contract?|

nt|Bernard was able to come up with a layout and a plan that would allow him to succeed. He was fortunate that this layout was the one that actually existed when this deal was played (he deserved ^*Isome^*M good luck given the very unlucky lie of the trump suit). Can you see how Bernard was able to come to 10 tricks?|

nt|Bernard made the fine play of leading his singleton diamond. He knew he was going to have to win some tricks with ruffs in his hand in order to make his contract and voiding himself of diamonds was the way to start this process. |
