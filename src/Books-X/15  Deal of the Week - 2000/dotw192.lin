^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #192 - May 15, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N during last week's ^*BCavendish Invitational Teams^*N in Las Vegas. Fred had the pleasure of playing with San Diego's ^*BGrant Baze^*N in this event. When this week's deal was played Fred and Grant faced ^*BMichael Courtney^*N and ^*BCharles Wigoder^*N, high stakes rubber bridge players from London. Full coverage of the 2000 Cavendish is available through:

^-
The Cavendish is the only bridge tournament in the world that offers serious cash prizes. As such, most of the top players in the world are regulars at this event. ^*BWorld Bridge Productions^*N, the company that runs the Cavendish, did a great job (as usual) with the organization of this year's edition. The ^*BDesert Inn^*N made a perfect venue for this tournament and we hope that the Cavendish will return to this hotel in the future.

The main event at the Cavendish is the Invitational Pairs in which Fred was playing with his regular partner, Brad Moss. Fred and Brad were sitting 4th going into the last session, but dropped to 10th place (the last position that paid a prize) largely due to the strong play of their opponents. A 10th place finish may not sound like much, but in a star-studded tournament like the Cavendish (with a field of 50 top pairs) it is not bad at all.

nt|There was not much to the bidding of this week's deal. Fred, South, dealt and opened 2NT (20-21) which was passed out. What card do you think Michael led as West? Michael and Charles lead 4th best against notrump.|

pc|C6|
nt|Michael found the lead of the @C6. It is usually a good idea to lead from your longest and strongest suit (diamonds here) against notrump, but when a 2NT opening bid is passed out it is often best to lead passively (especially from a hand with no 5-card suit). The idea is that you should try to avoid blowing a trick on the opening lead - the declarer will usually have a hard time winning 8 tricks without some help from the defense.|

nt|Charles switched to a heart. At first glance this looked like a pretty good (and brave) play as the defense was able to set up several tricks in the heart suit. As you will see, this return was not as effective as it first appeared. A diamond return would have been best, leaving Fred with no chance to make his contract given subsequent accurate defense. All 4 suits were returned by players in the Cavendish who faced this problem.|

We are back at the moment of truth. Do you think Fred played the @D10 or the @D7 from dummy?|

nt||lb|*CWhat did Fred play?^^d7^dt7|ls|nd|pc|d7|pc|d8|mc|7|nt|We are sorry to tell you that Fred played the @D7 and claimed down 1 when Charles followed with a spot card. Fred did make the percentage play as Charles was roughly twice as likely to have been dealt honor third in diamonds (20 combinations) than 3 small diamonds (10 combinations). It was a fun hand to play, even though the final result was a not very satisfying -50!|
