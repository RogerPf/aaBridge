^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 221 - December 4, 2000^*N }
^-
It will come as no surprise that our web site receives more visitors from the United States than from any other country in the world. In second place is The Netherlands, where there are over 100,000 competitive bridge players out of a population of only 15 million. We have some good news for our many Dutch friends: ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N has officially opened an office in The Netherlands and much of this web site (including ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N) has been translated into Dutch. You can visit the web site of ^*BBridge Base The Netherlands^*N through:

We are pleased to announce that ^*BLex De Groot^*N will be running the offices of ^*BBridge Base The Netherlands^*N in Arnhem. Lex was born in The Netherlands, but he spent his formative years as a bridge player in Canada in the 1970s. He won a North American Championship in 1976 and represented Canada in the World Open Pairs in 1978. Soon after, his bridge career was put on hold for many years as Lex focused his time and energy on his "real career" (a Professor of Electrical Engineering).

When Lex moved back to The Netherlands in 1993 he found that he had more time for bridge again, but he has since concentrated more on writing about the game than playing it. Lex's articles, in both Dutch and English, have been published widely. He has served as Daily Bulletin Editor of major tournaments, the webmaster of IMP Magazine's web site, a vugraph commentator for ^*Be-bridge^*N, and as a translator of educational software products. 

Lex's most recent project was the translation into Dutch of our highly acclaimed ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N software. That product is now available for sale in The Netherlands. Additional information about the Dutch version of ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N can be found through:

This week's deal was played by Lex way back in 1969.

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N is pleased to announce the release of our latest software product:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BPlay and Defend with Eddie Kantar^*N }

This educational product consists of 100 advanced problems (50 on play and 50 on defense) by one of the most popular bridge authors in history.

ls|sc|at|Barring some kind of miracle, the 12th trick would have to come from some sort of squeeze. Lex had been playing bridge for only a couple of years in 1969, but he had already spent some time studying squeeze play. He carefully considered various end positions before playing a card from the dummy.|

nt|Lex paused for thought after 5 rounds of diamonds. Both defenders had followed to 2 rounds of diamonds and both had discarded 2 small hearts (confirming Lex's suspicion that West was dealt the only defensive heart guard). West had also discarded a small club while East had pitched a revealing @SJ. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |

hs|es|hs|ws|nt|Lex had every reason to be proud of his first double squeeze. At the time he realized his line of play required some guesswork - he had to guess which defender was holding on to spades. Many years later Lex realized that 7NT was makable even if both defenders guarded the third round of spades (and clubs) as in the diagram above. Can you see how 7NT can be made on this layout?|

hs|ns|Hs|ss|hs|es|hs|Ws|at|The @SA and @SK will bring down all of the defenders' remaining spades and the @S10 will take the last trick. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


up|39|ls|ns|ls|ss|nt|The advantage of playing for a ^*Bcompound squeeze^*N on this deal is that this line will guarantee the contract regardless of the distribution of the East-West cards (assuming West has the @HQJ10). The problem with the ^*Bcompound squeeze^*N line is that it will often be difficult to guess the layout at the critical point in the play. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|Lex's line of guessing to play for either a ^*Bdouble squeeze^*N (when East guards spades) or a ^*Bsimple squeeze^*N (when West guards spades) will not always result in success on a double dummy basis - Lex's line would fail when both defenders guard spades and defend accurately. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ws|nt|The nice thing about Lex's line is that cashing 2 spades early would often make it much easier for declarer to guess the spade distribution at the critical point of the play. Lex's line is technically inferior to playing for a ^*Bcompound squeeze^*N, but as a practical matter, we suspect that Lex's line would be at least as effective in "real life".|
