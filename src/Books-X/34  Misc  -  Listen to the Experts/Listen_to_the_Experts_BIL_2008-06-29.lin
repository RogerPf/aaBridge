^C@2This movie is compiled from a  Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL)  Bridge Session held on 29 June 2008. @E@3Seven Random Deals were played. Over 100 members attended the session and were enthralled as players explained their reasons for bidding and the play of hands. Members were given the chance to ask questions at the end of each hand. This movie is an attempt to reproduce the session as closely to the live event as possible. 

The table of content has links organized in two columns. "Help Notes", "Introduction" and the Boards played are in the first column. Additional teaching material relevant to the boards and provided by Mr. Howard Schutzman are in the second column. You can see each section when you click its link. Use this page as an index while using the forward arrow to view the movie in its entirety. When done with any board or topic or anywhere in the movie you can click the   ^$119  box located second from left on the bottom of the screen to return here. Now, please first click the "Help Notes" link to start.

^c@2You can enjoy this movie as in a teaching mode by clicking the forward arrow to the end. All hands are @E@3open. During the bidding and the play of hands the chats by the player are made to the kibitzers. The chats are public any other time. At the end of each board, the viewer is able to play the hand|CP|8|FP||AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| before clicking the forward arrow and moving to the next board.

Additionally, as a reference, links in the second column represent synopsis on major topics discussed by the players during the play. Mr. Howard Schutzman whose generous help has been instrumental in making this movie, has provided all the information. In some boards, the relevant link is also embedded in the chat box when appropriate. Clicking the link then will take you to the page discussing the topic. Click    ^$119  box to return to the first page and then click the link to your desired board. 

The web site links in this file are clickable and change color when you move your cursor over it. The buttons at the bottom of the page (BBO tool bar) have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  

Finally, send this file in ZIP format if you wish to e-mail it. And to read all the text in the chat box, you must be in BBO |CP|8|at|"wide screen"|CP||at| mode. To set this mode, log in to BBO, click on the options button (yellow gear) at the bottom of page, go to the |CP|8|AT|"General"|CP||AT| tab, and check the |CP|8|AT|"wide screen" |CP||AT|then click |CP|8|AT|"Apply"|CP||AT| and |CP|8|AT|"OK" |CP||at|in succession.

^C@2Howard Schutzman |CP||at|(hondo717 -Teacher) is a teacher and expert player on Bridge Base Online. He has been @e@3playing duplicate bridge for more than 40 years. Over the years, he has developed articles and notes on learning to play bridge. This material is presented at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N and is available for anyone to download at no charge. Howard runs several free weekly teaching sessions on BBO.  His current schedule is posted on his web site and on the BIL Calendar of Events.|CP|8|AT|

Lee Goodman |CP||AT| (lgkc1 -Teacher) is the owner of The Bridge Studio ^*Hwww.kcbridgestudio.com^*N, Kansas City's main bridge club. Lee's bridge career peaked when he won the National Collegiate Bridge Championship back in the Dark Ages. Taking solace from the maxim that "Those that cannot do, teach" he is also Kansas City's most popular bridge teacher. He also plays on Bridge Base where kibitzers are encouraged to watch and make snide private comments as he frequently errs. |CP|8|AT|

Desiree Sergeant|CP||AT| (aspiring -BIL Grad) is an accomplished bridge player. Currently she has two students.  Des did a grand job for the BIL  running the BIL's Mentoring programme for a couple of years - it was she that really got that underway  |CP|8|at|

Brandon Einhorn |CP||AT| (Arclight -BIL Grad) has been playing Bridge for a few years.  He admits to reading many bridge books. He has an uncanny  ability in to count and predict opponents hand distribution from the bidding and after the first trick played. He wishes to have  more practical bridge experience. 

The above information in most part has been provided by the players. The organizer has made minor changes only because of space constraint.  Please note, as to be expected in any live sessions, there were a few minor typos which were corrected later. Also, there were clarifications which were added by the participants. Now please click the forward arrow where Maureen opens the session.

^C@2^*BBILmanager^*N (Lobby): => Club: @D@DThe Listen to Experts session  LGKC1(teacher) with BIL Grad Arclight @e@3Playing 2/1 and  Hondo717 (teacher) with BIL Grad Aspiring playing SAYC is now to start. 

There shall be NO private messaging the players - it is an unacceptable distraction, they will have their time cut out thinking about what they want to do and typing to tell you ( the audience)  what and why they are making each bid/ play of the cards.

Have your questions typed up and ready to send  To THIS ROOM at the end of the hand so all the players and kibs can see the question. The players will respond to the questions, then I will deal the next hand. The hands are randomly dealt  - the players are playing|CP|8|at|    'blind' |CP||AT| just as you do at a table.

^*Blgkc1:^*N hi guys
^*Baspiring:^*N hi lee 
^*Barclight:^*N we use 2/1   4th best leads    standard count/attitude. discards = odd/even  odd = like this suit.  even = don't like it.

^*Bhondo717:^*N Des and I are playing SAYC, to make it easier for the BIL members to follow our bidding, although we usually play weak NT and 2 over 1.  Because of that, we will on occasion chat alert each other to clarify bids that are ambiguous. We also play standard carding, no odd/even.

^*BBILmanager: ^*NI just dealt the first hand. Kibs start concentrating -  Lee, Arc, Howard and Des the floor is yours let us play Bridge.

mb|p|NT|^B@2
^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N of course, most people use this for 5-5 hands but arc is quite aggressive in his use of DONT.  Marty Bergen who invented it would probably approve. DONT-- 2@C=clubs and a higher suit, 2@D=diamonds and a higher suit, 2@H=hearts and a higher suit (obviously spades) |CP|8|AT|@D@D ^*GR01, Click me if you wish to read more on DONT ^*N|

^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N you should be counting his losers--2 losing spades, two losing diamonds and, he hopes, only one losing club if they split 3-3, but here there are two losers in clubs.  he also has ...a problem with the diamonds.  he will be lucky to go down one or two.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|C2|pc|SQ|AT|
^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N I suspect the Q is a false card by W, because she lead the 3,  if it was true, it means East opened 1NT with a 5 card spade suit and a good hand,  possible, but unlikely, and she ...might rebid 2@S over 2@c.|

^*B^*Baspiring->Kibs:^*N^*N another 1nt hand.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N nice clubs, too bad I'm vulnerable.  No bid this time.  I could DBL, and then pard must bid @c and I would pass,  but vulnerable, with so few HCP I may get killed.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|
^*Bgrizz->Kibs:^*N DONT is designed to find the lowest playable fit, and 4-3 is considered playable - the downside of DONT is that sometimes you don't find the BEST fit.|

^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N double of artificial bids is standard to show that suit. Just like doubling 2@C Stayman or the 2@D response to Stayman.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


mb|2S|AT|
^*Baspiring->Kibs:^*N transfer, so with 3 I simply just bid 2@s. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


mb|p|AT|
^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N because pard bid, they may play him for the @S Q. I will lead the stiff heart because of the DBL.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717->Kibs^*N: with 5 card major, better to play in the major, especially with a weak hand. So you should always transfer if you have a 5 card major.|

^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N else I'd lead the @C.   Like slogging through mud.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N gl, not much to work with here.
^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N HCP  4-16 them, pard has around 15, so that can happen.
^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N wonder how many hearts pd has--the 6 is unclear--also my diamonds look lousy in front of the declarer.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


pc|H4|pc|HJ|AT|
^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N Jack is correct play--third hand--lowest of equals.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717->Kibs^*N: hopefully, lee mentioned why he played the J, but if not, as 3rd hand, always play the lowest honor in a touching sequence. that way pard can often tell you have higher honors.|

^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N @cs are 2-2.   we use Count signals.  pard is playing hi-low.|

pc|S6|AT|
^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N don't play Q pd.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


AT| 
^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N If I duck, and the Spade J wins, I lose the Q as well.  This is a tough play.  may be deceptive. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


AT|
^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N if declarer had AK of trumps, she would play them both.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|
^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N for the 2@s bid over the X, that implies 3@s the way most play it.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|
^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N also,I kind of think pd has Q since declarer didn't go to dummy to finesse me.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Blgkc1->Kibs:^*N BTW--Des has shown A@H, A@S, A@C for 12 pts--only 3-5 left.  obviously not in hearts, pd has QJ of clubs--therefore, K or KQ of Diamonds.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


AT|
^*Barclight->Kibs:^*N if East has 3 spades to AK, then I think she would have  played them. I may be crashing my pard's King if I play my Q here.  @d@d = don't like it.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


pc|SQ|AT|
^*Bhondo717->Kibs^*N: brandon had a tough play on the spades, but it is unlikely des would play spades that way from AKx, so duck might be better.|

anitap1054: when arclight signaled that he didn't want a diamond lead, why didn't like play the Q of hearts instead of the club?

^*Blgkc1:^*N double of 2@H showed hearts--sort of a stolen bid but goes under the name of "lead directing double."  Just like doubles of Stayman 2@C or Stayman 2@D response or responses to Blackwood.

^*Bhondo717:^*N a double of an artificial bid, such as a transfer or Blackwood response, usually asks partner to lead the suit bid.|

PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N the basic answer to formulating a plan is to count your winners and losers, and come up with a way to take the appropriate number of tricks. 
^*Blgkc1:^*N typically, one counts winners and potential winners at NT and counts losers at suits--also note it's more difficult to play a hand after a transfer because you are looking at the ...hand "upside down."
^*Bwoodwork:^*N easier way to say that is this.. figure out a way to get rid of the losers before you ever begin to play the hand.|at|

^*Bhondo717:^*N I could take the spade finesse, but I had a sure way to make 3, and probably 4, so I wanted to draw trumps to make sure I didn't go down in case they got some ruffs, unlikely, but no real benefit to one extra trick. I would only lose 1 spade and make 5. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |

cp||fp||at|^-Mr. Howard Schutzman has provided this and all other teaching topics  
^-|
CP||FP||AT|
^C@2Let me review how DONT works. If my right hand opponent opens 1N, and I bid a suit, that shows a 2 suited @e@3hand, the suit bid and a higher suit. 
^C2@C shows clubs and any of the other suits;
^C2@D shows diamonds and either hearts or spades;
^C2@H shows hearts and spades specifically.
 
If partner has 3 card support in the suit I bid he passes. If he does not have 3 card support, he bids the next higher suit. The next higher suit does not promise that suit, it only says, partner does not like the suit I bid. I then pass if the next higher suit is my second suit, otherwise I bid my suit.

If I have a single suited hand, I double the 1N bid. Partner is obligated to bid 2@C, which I pass if my suit is clubs, otherwise I bid my suit. One other small wrinkle, I can bid 2@S directly with a single suited spade hand, or double. I usually prefer to bid 2@S, as that is more preemptive.

now, let me briefly discuss why I prefer DONT as opposed to Capp, which is the other popular method of interfering over 1N. DONT lets you compete on more hand types, and keeps the bidding at a lower level with many hands.

However, Capp gives you the advantage of showing a good hand by being able to double 1N for penalties. My feeling is that you rarely want to double 1N, so I think giving that up to show a single suited hand instead is not much of a cost.

For points, If vulnerable, you probably should have an opening hand, but you can even be 4/4. If you are 5/5, you can have as few as 9 points.|

^-Rabbi's Rule

CP||FP||AT|
^C@2This is more of a joke. "If the singleton K is offside, play the A." Its name derives from a fictional bridge kibitzer @e@3named "The Rabbi". Many articles have been written where a brilliant declarer figures out the only way to make the hand is to drop the singleton K offside. 

However, in real life that rarely happens (although it did happen on the last hand in the session, so Arc applied the rabbi's rule). As a counter example, a few days before, my partner was silly and tried to drop a singleton K offside in a grand slam, and we went down when we should have made, turning a top board into a bottom board, and costing us first place in the event.|

^-Pushing Opponents Into Makable Games
^-| 
CP||FP||AT|
^C@2This is more a bidding tactic that I espouse rather than a hard and fast rule. The idea is that in a competitive @E@3auction, do not make a bid that might push the opponents into bidding game unless you are pretty sure that they are going down in game. Again, it is a risk/reward calculation. 

If you push them into a makable game they were not going to bid, the amount of points you lose far outweighs any potential gain if they let you play the hand. The most common application of this rule is to not bid 4 of a minor in a competitive auction if you are not prepared to double them if they bid 4 of a major. 

On the hand in question, Des should not bid 4 hearts because she was not prepared to double 4 spades. It turns out, because of the 4-0 break, they don't make 4 spades, but if I had one less spade, or had my spots been lower, they would have made 4 spades, so the principle still applies. |

LTC
^-|
CP||FP||AT|
^C@2LTC stands for Losing Trick Count  This is a hand evaluation tool favored by some players. The idea is that @e@3each suit can have up to 3 losers in it. For each A, K, or Q in a 3+ card suit, you deduct one loser (so, for example, xxx is 3 losers, Qxx is two losers, KQx is one loser). Similarly, a two card suit can have at most two losers, and you deduct one loser for each A or K (so, for example, Qx is two losers, Kx is one loser, AK is no losers.) 

In the same vein, a singleton is one loser or zero losers if it is the singleton ace. Therefore, the maximum number of losers one hand can have is 12 (4 suits x 3 losers), and the maximum number of losers a partnership can have is 24 losers (12 losers in each hand). 

By subtracting the combined losers in both hands from 24, you come up with the number of tricks that the combined hands are likely to take. For example, a weakish opening hand is usually 7 losers, and if each partner has an opening hand, the number of combined losers is 14, which means they can make 10 tricks, 24 max losers - 14 actual loser = 10 winners,  which jives with the fact that an opening hand vs. an opening hand usually makes game. 

A weak opener (12-14) typically contains 7 losers, a medium opener (15-17) 6 losers, and a strong opener (18-20) 5 losers. A weak response (6-8) typically contains 9 losers and an invitational response (9-11) contains 8 losers. Personally, I feel you need to be careful using LTC, as it is an imperfect tool. However, combined with other hand evaluation techniques, such as Law of Total Tricks, it can be useful.

For those interested, Ron Klinger wrote an excellent book on LTC.|

CP||FP||AT|
^C@2This is a special way of using Stayman when responder has a very weak hand, and has at least 4 diamonds @e@3and at least 3 cards in each major. The idea is that with a weak responder hand, it is better to play in a suit than 1N. With such a hand, over a 1N bid, responder bids 2@C, intending to pass whatever partner bids (including the artificial 2@D response, denying a 4 card major.)|

^-2nd Hand Low
^-|
CP||FP||AT|
^C@2Almost always, it is right to play low as defender when playing the second card to a trick. If you decide not to  @E@3play low, you must have a very good reason. When in doubt, play low. Declarer does not know what you have, and must play 3rd hand high to win the trick By playing low, you often make him guess what to play. The other reason to play low is that it is best to use your honors to capture declarer's lower honors. However, if you can beat the contract, it is ok to play 2nd hand high.|

^-Preempts
^-|
CP||FP||AT|
^C@2My philosophy is to preempt with any long suit, regardless of quality. I tend to open 2 with a six card suit, 3 @E@3with a  seven card suit, and so forth. Vulnerable I might be slightly more cautious, but not much. I feel the risk/reward calculation favors aggressive preempts. The havoc you create to the opponents' auction more than outweighs the risk that you will be doubled and go down. This is particularly true in modern bridge, where many doubles are no longer penalty, making it difficult for the opponents to double for penalties.

Some people use a more disciplined style of preempting. For example, they require a certain number of honors in their suit, they don't preempt with an outside 4 card major, or they don't preempt with a void. I personally see little value in these rules, particularly the 4 card major and outside void rules.
