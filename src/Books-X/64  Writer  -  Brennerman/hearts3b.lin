You were first to play to the trick.

This week you move across the table and are now in the position referred to as ^*Ithird hand.^* 

Your role is important because you play last for your pair to the trick.

Let's see how you make your choice.|

PG| ***** 2 ***** |


At|^B@2^Z@3One of the sayings handed down from the days of whist is  ^*ithird hand high.^*


This implies that third hand should play as high a card to the trick as he can afford.

It helps to consider the circumstances in which they are best applied.

A typical situation is when partner leads a low card on the opening lead and a low card is played from the dummy.|
