I would like to thank the many people who make CC (Cardpotato College) possible.

Fred Gitelman is the greatest promoter of Bridge ever!

Without Fred and his staff, CC would be only a reform school.

The Bridge world owes Fred a great debt of gratitude!

Thank you Fred, from the bottom of all our @h's.|

The title of this course is ^*uThe ACBL Heart Series - Defense^*  by Audrey Grant.

Her copyrights apply as 99% of what I present is her wording and property.

Her comprehensive text is appropriate for the advancing player.

It is well worth purchasing and I hope you do.There is much in it that I do not cover. 

Please remember this is a lecture and can become lengthy.

Another thing you need to know is that this lecture abbreviates the Grant text.

It is more than an introduction, not something you read once and understand ompletely.|

HT|h|fp||AT|^b @2 ^z@3Defenders need to work as a team to defeat declarer's contract. 

They work try to overcome their main disadvantage - they cannot see each other's cards.

A defender tries to describe his hand to his partner through the specific card he plays to each trick.

We have already seen how this works when the opening lead is made.

For example, if you lead the Queen against a notrump contract, you are telling your partner
that you have the next lower card, the Jack but not the King.
 
The one card you lead gives partner information about two other cards!

The type of information defenders want to give each other through the cards they play falls into three basic categories.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3

You might want to tell partner your ^*Battitude^*  toward a specific suit; if you like it or not.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

You might want to tell partner about your ^*Bdistribution^*   - how many cards you have in the suit.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


at| 

Or you may want to tell partner you have a  ^*Bsuit preference^*  for his next lead.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|


Giving each other such information will help steer the defense.

The more you know about partner's hand, the more you can deduce about declarer's hand.

If you know what declarer holds, you will know which suits to lead and which suits to avoid, which suits to keep and which suits to discard.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |

Let's see how you go about signalling such information to each other (without whispering it across the table).|

AT|^B@2^Z@3Even if you cannot contribute a card that will win the trick or promote winners for your side, every card you play is important.

 Partner may not know whether he has led a suit that you like.

 Your "attitude" can give him the help he needs.|

If you automatically play your lowest card partner has to guess if you like the suit.

Naturally he could go wrong about half the time.

PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT|^B@2^Z@3It is not always necessary to give an attitude signal.

Your partner may already know it.

For example, if declarer is trying to develop a suit, attitude is assumed.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


at|
(If partner sees a lot of high cards he knows your negative attitude).|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


at|

Likewise, if you and partner have bid and raised a suit a positive attitude is already established.

If there is no point in giving attitude the next priority is to give a count signal.

Count is very useful. Your count shows declarer's count.

When you can count the hand out you have power tools.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


nt|^b@2^Z@3The mechanics of high then low are used to show an even number of cards in the suit.

Low then high shows an odd number of cards.

The word ^*Uhigh^*  has an ^*Ueven^*  number of letters and ^*Ulow^*  has an ^*Uodd^*  number of letters,
if that helps you remember.

You cannot tell exactly the number of odd or even cards, but many times it will be obvious.|

AT|^B@2^Z@3As with attitude signals, there is no point using count signals unless both partners are paying attention.

One partner has to give the signal, the other has to receive it.

This exercise offers an opportunity to interpret partner's count signal.|

at|^b@2^Z@3Sometimes the situation does not call for either an attitude signal or a count signal.

You may be able to give a ^*Isuit preference^*  signal.|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


at|

A suit preference signal tells partner which of ^*Btwo^*  suits you prefer.

This assumes that there will only be two available suits to choose from.

Usually trumps and the suit you are discarding are the not the options.

The high - low system is again used.|
pg| ***** 248 ***** |


at|

A high discard shows a preference for the higher remaining suit.

A low discard shows a preference for the lower remaining suit.|

It has been my pleasure to be here with you.
