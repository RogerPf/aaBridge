fp||at|^b @2 ^z@3Welcome to Lesson 4. Today we will look at Second hand play by defenders. 

The title of this course is ^*uThe ACBL Heart Series - Defense^*  by Audrey Grant. 

Her copyrights apply as 99% of what I present is her wording and property.

Her comprehensive text is appropriate for the advancing player.

It is well worth purchasing and I hope you do.There is much in it that I do not cover. 

Please remember this is a lecture and can become lengthy.

Another thing you need to know is that this lecture abbreviates the Grant text.

It is more than an introduction, not something you read once and understand completely.

Good Bridge requires lots of study and work.|

pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ht|f|fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Last week you were third hand and generally played high, trying to win the trick.

Tonight you will be sitting in the second chair.

Declarer is leading from his hand or dummy and you have to decide which card to play.

When you are sitting second seat the defense is in a favorable position.

Your partner is sitting fourth and plays last to the trick.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

Most of the time second hand wants to play low, leaving the trick taking to partner.

A popular maxim is ^*bsecond hand low,^*  the opposite of ^*bthird hand high.^*  

Like most guidelines, this one is most useful when we understand how it came about
and how to apply it.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Since partner plays last to the trick play low. There is no use wasting high cards early.

Wait until declarer plays a high card which you can capture.

When declarer plays a low card it is usually best to follow low.

If declarer plays an honor, another maxim, ^*Icover an honor with an honor^*  is likely to apply.|

at|^b@2^z@3High cards are most powerful when they win a trick ^*Band^*  capture an opponents' high card.

Aces are meant to take Kings - and Kings are made to take Queens.

If declarer plays a small card and you are second hand to play, most of the time it is best to play low also.

Let's go to a table and see why this works so well.|

AT|^B@2^Z@3Cover an honor with an honor when you think you can promote a trick for your side.

When it looks like there is no chance to promote a defensive trick you are probably better off playing second hand low.|

AT|^B@2^Z@3We just saw that it is best not to cover honors with honors if there is no chance to promote our low cards to winners.|AT|^B@2^Z@3

Sometimes there are touching honors with some room left to promote a lower ranking card.

The general rule is to wait until the last honor is led before covering.|

nT|^B @2 ^Z@3Well students, I just heard the old school bell ring ending today's lecture.

It has been my pleasure to be here with you.

One of the best tips I can give you to end this lecture is that:

Good habits make good Bridge players!

The best habit I can suggest is that you develop good study habits.|
