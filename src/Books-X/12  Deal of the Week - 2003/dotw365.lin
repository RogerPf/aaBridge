^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 365 - September 8, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both of this week's deals were played by me last week at an ACBL Regional tournament in Costa Mesa, California. I was playing with either ^*BBilly Miller^*N or ^*BAlan Sontag^*N when these deals were played. I played extensively with both Billy and Alan during the past week, but I am not sure which of them I was playing with when this week's deals took place.

I have sung the praises of Billy Miller in past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N and, as usual, we had a lot of fun (and a lot of success) playing together last week. This was the first time that I had ever played with Alan, but being his partner was an experience that I am unlikely to forget any time soon. Alan is easily the fastest great player that I have ever seen. I would not have thought it possible for anyone to play as quickly and effectively as Alan is somehow able to do.

The way that Alan treats his partners and opponents is also worth mentioning. There are a few professional players out there whose personalities do damage to our game, but pros like Alan Sontag help to make up for this. It is hard to imagine anyone not enjoying themselves at a bridge table with Alan, regardless of the results. He absolutely loves playing bridge and this is clear, both from his level of play and his demeanor.

Both of this week's deals are presented as declarer play problems. These 2 problems share a common theme, but they are not as difficult as most of the problems that appear in this feature.

sk|s|nt|In this week's first deal, the opponents were silent and I became the declarer in 3NT. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


pc|C9|at|West's opening lead was the @C9. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|C3|pc|CK|hs|sc|at|East followed suit with the @CK and I won my @CA. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|CA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|Think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hs|sc|nt|I had already won a club trick and I still had the @CQ. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|sc|Hs|nd|at|Dummy's 3 diamond winners brought my total up to 5 tricks. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|Barring a really bad heart break, it looked like I would be able to win at least 4 tricks in that suit. Establishing enough winners for my contract rated to be easy, but there still was a danger - can you see it? |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|The best play for 4 tricks in the heart suit is to start by cashing the @HK. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|nh|pc|hk|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h2|at|Suppose that both defenders follow small |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|sh|at|and that the @HJ continuation |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|hj|pc|hq|hs|nh|at|is covered by West's @HQ. Dummy's @HA wins the trick |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|ha|pc|h3|at|as East follows. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|nh|at|On the third round of hearts, |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|ht|pc|h6|pc|c2|pc|c5|at|West discards a club |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|nh|at|and the fourth round of hearts |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|c4|pc|c6|at|is won by East. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


sk||hs|ec|hs|sc|nt|Everything would be fine if East was to return a club at this point, |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|ec|hs|ed|at|but a diamond return (before or after 1 or more rounds of spades) |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|es|hs|ws|hs|wd|at|would leave the defenders in a position to win 3 spade tricks and 1 diamond trick. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|es|ls|wd|hs|sc|mc|8|at|The declarer would never win a trick with his @CQ and his contract would fail. Do you see how I was able to avoid this danger? |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|sc|up|16|hc|hk|nt|Instead of leading the @HK at trick 2, |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


lc|hk|hc|hj|at|I led the @HJ. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


lc|hj|pc|hj|hs|wh|
at|West covered with the @HQ |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|hq|hs|nh|at|and I allowed him to hold the trick. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|h4|pc|h2|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|sh|at|By retaining the @HK entry to my hand, |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|wd|at|the threat of a diamond return by the defense was neutralized. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d4|at|On that defense (no other defense is any better), I could win in the dummy, |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|da|pc|d2|pc|d5|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|cross to the @HK, |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hk|pc|h9|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|sc|at|cash the @CQ, |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|cq|pc|c5|pc|s7|pc|cj|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|nh|at|and win the next 5 tricks in dummy. |mc|9|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sd|ls|nd|up|16|hs|sh|hs|wh|hs|eh|nt|Leading the @HJ on the first round of the suit (and ducking when West played the @HQ) was necessary in order for me to win 9 tricks against the actual layout. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


md|0,h6,,hq|at|Note that if East's four hearts included the @HQ, he could defeat the contract only by making the difficult play of allowing my @HJ to hold. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|eh|ls|wh|pc|hj|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h2|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


up|3|ls|eh|hs|wh|md|0,h2hq,,d4c5|at|Similarly, if West was dealt 4 hearts to the @HQ, he must duck my @HJ for the defense to prevail. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |

The problem that I faced here was similar in some ways to the one that was presented in the deal that you just saw. While the theme of the first deal is something that I have seen before, I don't think I have ever seen anything quite like the theme in the deal you are about to see. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


mb|1D|mb|P|mb|1H|
hs|sh|nt|My partner opened 1@D as North, East passed, and I responded 1@H. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|sh|mb|1S|at|West overcalled 1@S |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|and I ended up as the declarer in 3NT after no further bidding by the opponents. |mb|2C|mb|P|mb|2S|mb|P|mb|3C|mb|P|mb|3H|mb|P|mb|3S|mb|P|mb|3N|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


pc|SK|at|West's opening lead was the @SK (a low spade would have worked better, but perhaps the tenuous sound of our auction suggested that we might not have had a true spade stopper). |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


pc|S7|pc|S4|pc|S6|nt|East followed with the @S4 |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


pc|SA|at|and West continued with the @SA |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


pc|S8|pc|S3|pc|SQ|at|as East completed his echo by playing the @S3. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|S9|hs|ss|at|West continued with the @S9 (apparently a suit preference signal for hearts). I won the trick in my hand |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|ST|pc|D5|pc|SJ|at|as East discarded a diamond. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|Think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sh|nt|Having won one trick already and with 4 top winners in hearts and diamonds, |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|I needed only 4 club tricks in order to make my contract. If clubs were 3-2 there would be no problem. If East had all 5 clubs I would have no chance. Setting up a 4th club trick when East was dealt @CJxxx would be easy, but as on the last deal, there was danger lurking. Do you see it? |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|Suppose that I had started clubs in the "normal" fashion, by winning the first club trick in the dummy |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|ck|pc|c2|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|nc|Hs|sc|at|and the second round of clubs with my @CA. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|ca|sk||hs|ws|at|On the layout shown above, West would have to discard one of his spade winners in order to defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s2|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


hs|sh|at|I would be unable to cash my @HAK |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ec|at|while setting up a club trick without allowing the defense to win 5 tricks first. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|up|8|hs|ec|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|So playing clubs in the "normal" fashion was not going to work if East was dealt 4 clubs headed by the @CJ. Can you see how I was able to guard against this layout of the cards? |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at|I started clubs with the strange play of leading low to the dummy's @C10 on the first round of the suit. This play would have picked up @CJxxx with West and I did not mind losing the trick if East had the @CJ. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|pc|C3|pc|C7|pc|CT|pc|CJ|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|ls|eh|nt|
There was no return that East could make that would threaten my contract. I had established my game-going trick in clubs |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|nc|hs|sh|at|while retaining the @CA as an entry to the @HAK in my hand. |mc|9|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


up|15|hs|nc|ls|sh|nt|I find it amazing, given the number of bridge deals that I have played, studied, or watched during the past 20 years, that I have never seen this play before (at least as far as I can remember). It is not rare for me to encounter new card play positions, but it is strange that something so "simple" had eluded me until last week!|
