^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 335 - February 10, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I just got home from Yokohama, Japan where I had the pleasure of playing in the ^*B8th NEC Bridge Festival^*N. While the results that my team achieved in this tournament were not very impressive, I really enjoyed my trip. Not only is Japan a fascinating country, but I was most impressed at the organization of the tournament and the warm hospitality that we received.

My thanks go out to the ^*BJapan Contract Bridge League^*N for inviting me to play in this tournament and to the ^*BNEC Corporation^*N whose generous sponsorship helped to make this event possible.

If you want to find out more about the ^*B8th NEC Bridge Festival^*N, click on the blue rectangle below. You will be taken to the official tournament web site in a new browser window. I strongly suggest that you take a look at the fabulous daily bulletins created by ^*BEric Kokish^*N and ^*BRich Colker^*N. As a former daily bulletin editor, it is hard for me to imagine how Eric and Rich are able to pack so much quality bridge writing into each of their bulletins.

I was the declarer when this week's deal was played during the 4th match in the qualifying round of the ^*BNEC Cup^*N, the premier event at the ^*BNEC Bridge Festival^*N. My partner was Montreal's ^*BJoey Silver^*N who I have written about many times in past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N. Joey and I faced Polish stars ^*BKrzysztof Martens^*N and ^*BMarcin Lesniewski^*N in a 20-board IMP match when this week's deal was played.

mb|?|nt|Neither side was vulnerable and, after 2 passes, Marcin opened 3@S as West. Joey, North, doubled for takeout and Krzysztof passed as East. I was sitting South and I had to decide what to bid. What call do you think I made?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^5c|
hs|sc|mb|5C|nt|I chose to jump to 5@C as I did not think that 4@C (the only alternative that I even considered) did justice to my hand. It should be noted that several strong players did bid only 4@C with my hand when they faced the same problem (the boards were duplicated at all 42 tables that were playing in the ^*BNEC Cup^*N). |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|If I had bid only 4@C, it would be reasonable for Joey to play me for some useful values, but I did not think I could expect him to play me for quite as much as I was dealt. We would sometimes play in 4@C when 5@C was a desirable contract. Another advantage to bidding 5@C was that this call would sometimes put Joey in a good position to raise me to 6@C if he was dealt a suitable hand.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|nt|Everyone passed so 5@C became the final contract. |

at|Marcin selected the @H10 as his opening lead and when Joey lay down his dummy, I was pleased to see that we had arrived in a reasonable contract. Think about how you would play this hand as the declarer before reading on. Marcin is a disciplined bidder and he would normally have a 7-card spade suit for his 3@S opening bid.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|I thought that my best chance would be to try to establish the dummy's diamond suit |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nh|At|so I won the first trick in the dummy |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|HA|pc|H3|pc|H2|

at|How would you continue from here? |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|I crossed to my hand by playing the @C9 to my @CK |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|ck|pc|c2|at|and, when both defenders followed small, |

ls|sd|pc|dk|pc|dj|pc|d3|pc|d5|at|(Marcin followed with the @DJ). |

hs|nc|hs|sc|at|I returned to the dummy with the @CA |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c4|pc|ct|pc|ca|pc|c5|at|as both defenders followed. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sc|at|My next move was to ruff a diamond in my hand. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sc|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|c7|pc|s4|at|Marcin's spade discard marked him with 2 cards in both minors (and very likely an original distribution of 7222). |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|nc|nt|There wasn't much more to the play. I ruffed a spade in the dummy |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nc|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|c6|pc|sj|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sc|At|and ruffed another diamond in my hand |

ls|sc|pc|cq|pc|st|pc|h5|pc|cj|

hs|nh|hs|sh|At|and crossed to the @HK. |

ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hk|pc|h6|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


mc|11|at|The dummy's @D10 represented my 11th winner so I claimed my contract for a satisfying +400. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


sk||up|39|hs|ed|nt|Both of my opponents are very strong analytical players and after this deal was played we had a discussion about what might have happened if Krzysztof had ducked his @DA at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|d5|at|At first glance we thought that I might have gone down as a result, but it did not take long for us to realize that I still could (and probably would) have prevailed. Can you see how?|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|I would have won the @DK |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|dk|pc|d8|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|wd|at|and I suspect that I would have exited with a diamond to Marcin's @DJ. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|wd|pc|d4|pc|dj|pc|d3|pc|d9|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|wh|hs|nh|At|Marcin's best defense would be to lead back a second heart and I would win that trick in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|nh|pc|h8|pc|hk|pc|h6|pc|h4|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|ns|at|I could then prevail by cashing the @SA |

hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and drawing 2 rounds of trump ending with dummy's @CA. |

ls|nd|ls|sc|pc|d7|pc|da|pc|c8|pc|s8|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


hs|sc|Hs|ec|hs|nd|At|I could then draw the last trump (discarding dummy's winning diamond)  |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|ec|ls|nd|pc|cq|pc|st|pc|dt|pc|cj|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|eh|at|and exit with the @HJ to East's @HQ. |

ls|sh|ls|eh|pc|hj|pc|sq|pc|h5|pc|hq|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|nh|mc|11|at|Krzysztof would have to lead a heart to dummy's @H9 at trick 13 to give me my 11th trick and my contract. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|eh|up|41|hs|wd|nt|Let's look at one other interesting variation. Suppose that Krzysztof had ducked his @DA and that Marcin had then decided to unblock his @DJ under my @DK. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|Wd|pc|dj|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|ed|At|Now Krzysztof could win the second round of diamonds |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|ed|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d9|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


hs|ed|at|and lead back a third round of that suit |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|da|hs|ec|hs|wc|at|to promote a trump trick for the defense. Do you see how I could still make my contract after this start? |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|ec|hs|sc|nt|In order to get home I would have to start by ruffing high. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|ck|pc|s2|pc|d6|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|wc|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|There are several possible winning sequences from here. For example, I could draw 2 rounds of trump, |

hs|ss|hs|nc|at|and ruff a spade in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nc|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|c9|pc|sj|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


hs|nd|at|The lead of the winning diamond from the dummy |
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|dt|hs|eh|hs|ec|at|would leave Krzysztof with no good answer. |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


ls|eh|nt|If Krzysztof ruffs in this position, |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|cj|hs|ss|at|I could discard my losing spade (or the @HJ) from my hand. |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|s9|pc|st|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|sh|hs|nh|at|East would be endplayed into leading away from his @HQ. |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |

pg| ***** 80 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|h6|hs|sh|at|I would discard a heart as well. |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|h4|pc|sq|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


hs|nh|at|I could then cash dummy's high heart |

ls|nh|pc|hk|pc|h7|pc|hj|pc|h8|
