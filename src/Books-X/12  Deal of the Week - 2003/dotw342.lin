^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 342 - March 31, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Another week, another bridge tournament...

Last week's tournament was the ^*BGlitter Gultch Sectional^*N that took place right here in sunny Las Vegas. Those of you who live outside North America may not know that Sectional tournaments are the smallest class of tournaments that the ACBL runs. Las Vegas Sectionals, however, are far from typical. These tournaments last almost a week and they are always very well attended. Top players from all over the United States often come to Las Vegas for its Sectional tournaments.

My partner for this tournament was ^*BBilly Miller^*N (who lives about a mile from me). We played on a team with ^*BCarolyn Lynch^*N-^*BDennis Dawson^*N and ^*BJohn Sutherlin^*N-^*BFred Hamilton^*N. I am happy to report that our team won 3 of the 4 events that we played in and that we placed 2nd in the fourth event. This week's deal was played by Billy (who's partner was Dennis at the time) in the Open Swiss Teams event on Sunday.

Billy Miller is both an A1 player and an excellent partner. This alone makes him a pleasure to play with, but there is something else about Billy that makes him very special. Billy is the author of ^*BDear Billy^*N, a monthly column in ^*BThe ACBL Bulletin^*N. His column is intended for players at the beginner to intermediate level and it is extremely popular. Billy runs into a lot of his fans during a typical tournament and he is ^*Balways^*N happy to meet them and to answer their bridge questions. When one of these people leaves our table, it is clear that meeting Billy helped to brighten up his or her day. Billy Miller is a great ambassador of our game and a model of how experts should behave.

hs|es|sk||hs|ss|nt|The appearance of the @SK made the rest of the deal an open book for Billy. East still had the @SJ108 left which meant that Billy would have some work to do in order to lose only one more trick. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|es|hs|ed|at|Although he could not be certain about the heart count, East appeared to have been dealt a 5242 hand. In any case, Billy needed East to have 3 diamonds left for there to be a chance.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|ss|hs|es|nt|Regular readers of Billy's columns might think it impossible to avoid losing 2 trumps tricks in this position, but for a technician of Billy's calibre this was not a very difficult problem. |
