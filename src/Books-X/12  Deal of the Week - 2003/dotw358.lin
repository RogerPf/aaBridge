hs|ss|nt|In this week's deal, East dealt and passed and I opened 1@S as South. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


hs|sc|at|Why 1@S instead of 1@C? Good question! The issue of which black suit to opening with hands of various strengths containing 5 spades and 5 clubs is one that has been a subject of fierce debate since the earliest days of bridge. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|In all honesty, I have given very little thought to this issue. The late great ^*BEdgar Kaplan^*N who was a mentor of both Brad and myself was an outspoken advocate of opening 1@S on hands like mine. When Brad and I developed our bidding system, we chose to defer to Edgar on this issue rather than spending a lot of time thinking about it ourselves. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|P|mb|2D|an|Forcing to game|mb|P|mb|3C|

nt|West passed and Brad responded with 2@D which we play as a natural game force. The science of bidding after a game-forcing 2/1 response has not been fully developed yet. One open question is how good a hand must be for a "high reverse" like the 3@C rebid I chose on my actual hand. For Brad and myself, a 5-5 hand with 2 strong suits is sufficient for 3@C here.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3H|
ls|sc|nt|Brad's 3@H rebid can be be described as a "quasi-natural grope". His 3@H bid denied the ability to rebid diamonds, to support either of my suits, or to suggest a final contract by bidding 3NT. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hs|sc|mb|P|mb|4C|at|I had little choice other than to rebid my clubs |

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^6s|ls|sd|ls|sc|mb|6S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|I chose to play in 6@S which became the final contract. I had 2 reasons for making this choice. First, I expected Brad to have a spade holding like @SAx and, opposite that, my @SJ was a very strong card. Second, we were playing a matchpoint event so there was additional incentive for us to play in the higher-scoring major suit slam.

hs|ns|hs|ss|at|West's opening lead was the @H10 and, when the dummy came down, it appeared that we had arrived in a pretty good contract. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nh|at|Our opponents were playing that the lead of a 10 promised either 0 or 2 higher cards. Given that the dummy had the @H9 and that East had not opened the bidding with a weak 2@H, it was likely that West's @H10 was from a holding headed by the @HKJ10. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nh|nt|You can think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before you read on, but you should know in advance that I am not going to offer any definitive suggestion on how this hand ^*Ishould^*N be played. If I had any strong feelings about the best line of play on this deal, I would let you know, but here I am just going to tell you what happened at the table. |

pc|SJ|pc|S9|hs|nd|at|On the 4th round of trump, I made what turned out to be a key play of discarding a diamond (as opposed to a heart) from the dummy. |

ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|it appeared that I was going to have to win a 2nd diamond trick to make my contract. It turns out that the position of the @DQ was not relevant. In fact, I could have claimed my contract at this point. Can you see why?|
