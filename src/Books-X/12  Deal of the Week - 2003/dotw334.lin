I would like to thank the ^*BJapan Contract Bridge League^*N (and especially its Executive Secretary, ^*BMr. Tadayoshi Nakatani^*N) for making these broadcasts possible. Another person who was instrumental in this process was my friend ^*BBob Geller^*N who just happened to be the declarer in this week's deal.

According to Bob, we met in person in the mid-1980s when I was in Japan playing in my first international tournament. I am afraid that I don't remember meeting Bob at this time, but we have become quite well-acquainted during the past year or so through extensive contact by e-mail.

Bob has been the driving force behind the Japanese translation of the ^*BLearn to Play Bridge^*N program that I wrote. The ^*BACBL^*N and the ^*BACBL Educational Foundation^*N provided the original funding for the English version of this program (which is available as a free download through ^*Hwww.acbl.org^*N). ^*BLearn to Play Bridge^*N is a comprehensive course on bridge that is intended for complete beginners. If you have any friends who are interested in learning to play our game (or friends who played years ago and are looking to brush up on their skills), I strongly suggest that you tell them about this free program.

The ^*BACBL^*N deserves a lot of credit for helping to finance and distribute ^*BLearn to Play Bridge^*N. Since this program was released in 1999, over 250,000 people have downloaded it from the ^*BACBL's^*N web site. This program has already been translated into Danish, Dutch, and German and the Japanese version should be finished within the next few months. I am just about finished with the sequel to ^*BLearn to Play Bridge^*N (which again was financed by the ^*BACBL^*N and the ^*BACBL Educational Foundation^*N). ^*BLearn to Play Bridge 2^*N should be available as a free download through the ^*BACBL^*N web site by the end of February.

The Japanese translation of ^*BLearn to Play Bridge^*N has been a real programming challenge for me since the Japanese character set is fundamentally very different from that of English (not to mention the dozen or so other languages that I have written programs for). I have to admit that I would have given up on this project long ago if it had not been for the inspiration and support that I have received from ^*BBob Geller^*N.

Given that you are an astute bridge player, you no doubt drew the inference that Bob's name doesn't sound very Japanese. In fact, Bob was born, raised, and educated (both in geophysics and in bridge) in the United States. Bob has been a faculty member at the University of Tokyo since 1984. He specializes in the study of the mathematical theory of seismic wave propagation and determining the structure of the earth's interior.

Bob has been a member of the ^*BJapan Contract Bridge League's^*N Board of Directors since 1990. He has also established himself as one of the leading players in Japan, having won 17 national titles, and representing Japan 4 times on its National Team. He was on the team that placed second in the ^*BCavendish Teams^*N in 1988.

When this week's deal was played, Bob's partner was ^*BSetsuko Ogihara^*N, another one of Japan's leading players. Setsuko is actually responsible for the massive job of translating the text of ^*BLearn to Play Bridge^*N into Japanese (Bob is the project coordinator). Her tireless efforts and patience with my inexperience with the Japanese language have been greatly appreciated.

Bob played this week's deal at a recent IMP event in Tokyo. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

hs|sc|nt|Bob continued by leading the @CJ out of his hand. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|sc|
pc|CJ|pc|C7|pc|C2|pc|C5|at|When this held, he correctly drew the inference that that @CK had been dealt to West (as East would have almost certainly won the trick if he had been able to do so). |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Furthermore, Bob now realized that the @DA was sure to be on his right (since West would not have passed in first position with the @DA in addition to the @HKQ, the @CK). |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|sc|nt|It looked like Bob was going to need to set up a further club winner in order to have a chance to make his contact. He decided to lead the @C6 next in the hope that East would win the trick (since East could still have the @DAQ). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|C6|pc|C9|pc|C3|pc|C8|at|At the table, West actually won the @C9 as East followed |

pc|CQ|pc|D3|pc|D7|pc|D9|at|Both of the defenders discarded diamonds on this trick. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|When Bob led the @SJ out of his hand, |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|ss|
pc|SJ|pc|D8|at|this card was greeted by a diamond discard from West. At first glance the 4-2 spade break suggested that Bob's contract was doomed, but East had actually been the victim of a rare ^*Bsteppingstone squeeze^*N on the previous trick. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


sk||hs|es|hs|ed|at|Here are the cards that remained. East, who had to keep both of his spades, had been squeezed down to a singleton @DA. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ed|hs|ns|nt|Bob had no trouble reading the end position. He played low from the dummy and won the trick with his @SJ. |

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


up|12|ls|ns|ls|es|hs|ed|hs|sc|nt|Here was the position when Bob led his last club and East was forced to bare his @DA. As was mentioned, this end position is known as a ^*Bsteppingstone squeeze^*N. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|ed|md|0,s86,,d83|hs|ws|at|If it turned out that West had been dealt 4 spades (instead of East), a different type of squeeze would have occurred when Bob cashed his last club winner. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|ws|pc|cq|hs|ws|nt|In this position, West would be forced to keep both of his spades. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|wd|at|Therefore, he would have to discard down to a singleton @DQ |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|dt|hs|nd|at|and Bob would discard dummy's last small diamond as before. |

pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|d8|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|ed|hs|wd|at|Bob could continue by leading the dummy's @DK to East's @DA while West's @DQ would be pinned. |

ls|ed|ls|sd|up|12|hs|sc|nt|The end position shown above is a variation of the ^*Bvice squeeze^*N. Both the vice and the steppingstone are 2-loser squeezes that were originally analyzed and (aptly) named by ^*BTerrence Reese^*N (who is one of my favorite bridge authors). |
