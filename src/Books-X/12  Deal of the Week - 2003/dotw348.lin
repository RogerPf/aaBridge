^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 348 - May 12, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
My partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and I just won the ^*BCavendish Invitational Pairs^*N - how about that! There were a lot of interesting and exciting deals in this event and I will be describing several of these in upcoming editions of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N.

This week's deal took place when 2 of America's top pairs (^*BBobby Levin^*N-^*BSteve Weinstein^*N and ^*BBart Bramley^*N-^*BSidney Lazard^*N) faced each other in an early match in the ^*BCavendish Teams^*N. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

We set all sorts of attendence records on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N during our live Internet vugraph broadcast of the 2003 Cavendish. We had over 1600 people logged in at one point and almost half of these were watching our vugraph broadcast. Our next live vugraph broadcast will be of the finals of the ^*BFrench National Mixed Teams^*N on May 18. Session starting times can be found at:

hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|The essence of this problem is to find a way to avoid 3 club losers. That rates to be difficult since Bramley is marked with the @CA (Lazard opened with a weak 2 bid and has already shown up with most of the top heart honors and the @DK). Watch how Weinstein was able to hold his club losers to 2.|

pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|CJ|
hs|sc|hs|wc|nt|On the actual layout, Weinstein was the one with the @C10 and he was able to win a trick with that card by covering Lazard's @CJ with his @CK. Bramley won the @CA, |

pg| ***** 52 ***** |

pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|sc|hs|wd|hs|ns|hs|sc|at|and a diamond ruff, conceding a ruff and discard, would be equally ineffective. |

ls|wc|ls|sc|at|Lazard did miss a much earlier chance to defeat the contract. Did you spot it? |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


up|38|


hs|eh|nt|Lazard's play of overtaking his partner's @HK opening lead with the @HA was necessary for the defense, |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|ha|pc|h3|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


hc|c9cj|at|but Lazard had to switch to the @C9 (or the @CJ) at trick 2 to defeat the contract! Such a play would break up the endplay potential of the club suit and subsequent accurate defense would then leave the declarer without recourse. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|It is hard to fault Lazard for not finding the 4th dimension defense of the @C9 (or the @CJ) return on this deal since the bidding told him very little about the layout of the minor suits. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


lc|cj9|hs|ed|at|His actual switch to the @DK is more than reasonable with only his hand and the dummy in view. In any case, none of this takes away from the fact that ^*BStevie Weinstein^*N really played this hand well!|
