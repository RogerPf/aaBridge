^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 368 - September 29, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BKrzysztof Jassem^*N in a tournament to select the Polish team for the upcoming ^*BBermuda Bowl^*N World Champions in Monte Carlo. Jassem was playing with ^*BPiotr Gawrys^*N when this week's deal was played. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N (not to mention fans of high-level bridge) know that Krzysztof Jassem really stand outs as a great declarer in a country that boasts a remarkable number of world class bridge players.

I would like to thank ^*BMarek Wójcicki^*N for bringing this deal to my attention. Marek is one of the key people behind the ^*BBridge Base Poland^*N web site. One of the main purposes of this web site is to help serve the many Polish members of ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N), but ^*BBridge Base Poland^*N also has an English language area which you can go to in a new browser window by clicking the yellow rectangle below:

^*BBBO^*N continues to grow at a remarkable pace. We now have over 1800 people online at peak times each day, over 1000 people online more than half of the time, and over 500 people online even when it is the middle of the night in North America. During the past week people logged in to our site from over 17,000 computers. During the course of any given day there are close to 140,000 logins made to ^*BBBO^*N!

nt|^*BBBO^*N is an entirely ^*Bfree^*N service that allows people to play various forms of online bridge (including several types of tournaments), to watch ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcasts of major tournaments, and to experience a variety of educational, training, and social areas. You can download the software that will install the ^*BBBO^*N program on your computer for ^*Bfree^*N through the following web site:

On October 4th and 5th, the ^*BGerman National Team Qualificiation^*N will be broadcast as ^*Blive^*N vugraph through ^*BBBO^*N. It is also very likely that the ^*B2nd EBL Champions Cup^*N will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N from Rome on October 10th, 11th, and 12th. 8 of Europe's leading bridge countries have been invited to send teams to participate in this event and the bridge rates to be outstanding.

I also am very excited to report that the ^*B2003 World Bridge Championship^*N will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N from Monte Carlo on ^*BBBO^*N from November 2 to 15. This will be the first time that we will feature either the ^*BBermuda Bowl^*N or the ^*BVenice Cup^*N on our site. We are fully expecting to break all kinds of attendence records during this tournament (hopefully our poor server will be able to handle it!).

The details of our broadcasts of the ^*BEBL Champions Cup^*N and the ^*B2003 World Championships^*N have not been completely worked out yet. When we have more information about the exact dates and starting times of these broadcasts the information will be posted at:

nt|In this week's deal, ^*BPiotr Gawrys^*N, North, dealt and opened with a Polish 1@C. The 1@C opening is the cornerstone of the Polish Club system. In that bidding system, 1@C can be based on 3 possible types of hands: a minimum balanced hand without a 5-card major, a hand of any strength with long clubs, or a very strong hand with any distribution. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|2H|an|Weak with either spades or hearts and a minor|
nt|East's 2@H overcall showed either a weak hand with long spades or a weak 2-suiter with hearts and one of the minors. My friend Marek called this the ^*BTutti Frutti^*N convention when he sent me his report of this deal. |

hs|nh|hs|sh|at|no doubt lamented briefly that he was not in 6@H, |

ls|nh|ls|sh|at|and then tried to think of a way to win 12 tricks in notrump. How would you play as the declarer?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Jassem had won the first trick and he had 4 sure winners in hearts. |

ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Even if he could win 4 diamond tricks, |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|Hs|sc|at|it looked like he was going to have to win a 3rd club trick in order to come to 12 winners. At first glance it appeared that a singleton @CQ was his only legitimate hope. Jassem saw another chance - can you see it?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Jassem started out investigating the East-West distribution by cashing 2 rounds of hearts. He played a heart to dummy's @HQ |

at|The chances of there being a singleton @CQ were now very remote so Jassem decided to make use of the other string on his bow. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|The time had come for Jassem to try to win 4 tricks in diamonds. There were several possible layouts of the diamond suit that make it possible to win 4 tricks, but the way that Jassem played diamonds |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|was a function of the distribution that he needed in the club suit. I am not going to tell you why just yet, but Jassem needed East to have 4 clubs to the @CQ in order to have a chance.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|Jassem already knew that East had been dealt 6 spades (from the bidding) and 1 heart (from the early play). He was assuming that East started with 4 clubs |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|so there was only room for him to have been dealt 2 cards in diamonds. Do you know the percentage play for 4 diamond tricks given that East started with 2 cards in the suit?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|Not surprisingly, Jassem took the correct percentage play for 4 diamond tricks (which would ^*Bnot^*N be the correct play if a 3-3 diamond break was possible!). He cashed the @DK |

ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|hs|es|hs|ss|at|He therefore had to come down to a singleton @SA and, when Jassem exited with a low spade, East won the trick with that card. |
