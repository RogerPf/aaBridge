hs|sc|nt|In this week's deal North, dealt and opened 1@H and South responded with a game-forcing 2@C. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|sh|mb|P|mb|2H|mb|P|mb|3H|at|North's 2@H rebid did not promise any extra length in hearts and South's 3@H was a slam try. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sc|mb|P|mb|4C|an|Cuebid|mb|P|mb|4N|an|Roman Keycard Blackwood|
at|When North cuebid 4@C (clearly showing the @CK given South's club holding), South judged that his hand had improved to the point that he could take control via 4NT (Roman Keycard Blackwood). |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|sc|mb|P|mb|5D|an|1 or 4 keycards|
nt|In this variation of Blackwood the King of the agreed trump suit (hearts in this case) counts as an Ace. North's 5@D response showed either 1 or 4 of the 5 "Aces". |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|sh|at|South now knew that either the @HA or the @HK was missing so he signed off in 6@H. |mb|P|mb|6H|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|sh|mb|P|mb|P|mb|D|at|This was passed around to East who doubled. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|South retreated to 6NT which became the final contract. |mb|6N|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||pc|D9|at|West's opening lead was a friendly @D9. Think about how you would play this hand as the declarer before reading on. You can assume that East has a powerful heart holding for his double of 6@H (a double that he clearly should not have made since he chased you from a contract that had no chance into a contract that you can make if you play correctly). |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|There are only 8 top tricks (the @SA, |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|nh|at|the @HA, |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|nh|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|3 diamond tricks given the opening lead, |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|Sc|at|and 3 club tricks). |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|East's double suggests that it would be possible to win a trick with the @HQ by leading toward that card, but East's likely heart length means that you will not be able to depend on that suit for any more than 2 tricks. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nc|Hs|sc|nt|Therefore it appears that you will need a 3-3 club break to come anywhere close to the 12 tricks that you need. If clubs are 3-3 you will have 10 certain winners. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|Although you can bring your total up to 11 tricks by playing on hearts, it is far from clear where your 12th winner will come from. Can you see any way to bring home this slam?|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|nt|Obviously you should play a low diamond from the dummy at trick 1. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|DT|pc|DQ|hs|sd|at|When East produces the @DQ, you should win your @DA |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |

pc|C4|pc|C9|pc|CA|pc|C6|

pc|CQ|pc|CT|pc|H3|pc|CJ|at|When both defenders follow to 3 rounds of clubs, the contract has a chance. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|nh|at|Finish the clubs and make sure to discard hearts from the dummy. |

pc|C7|pc|S4|pc|H6|pc|H9|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|ns|at|It is essential to keep all 3 of dummy's spades (you will see why soon). |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|ls|ns|
nt|You should continue by cashing the dummy's diamond winners. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|D3|pc|D2|pc|DK|pc|D4|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


pc|DJ|sk||hs|es|at|For the contract to have a chance, East must hold the @SK. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|eh|at|If this is the case then the dummy's last diamond will catch East is an unusual type of ^*Bstrip squeeze^*N. East will be forced to come down to a doubleton King in either hearts or spades. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|eh|at|Suppose East discards a spade in the position shown above. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|es|pc|S9|pc|D5|pc|D6|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|You can now play a spade to your @SA |

ls|ns|ls|ss|
pc|S3|pc|SJ|pc|SA|pc|S6|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|es|at|and then duck a spade to East's now singleton @SK. |

ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|
pc|S2|pc|S7|pc|S5|pc|SK|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|ns|at|In this way the dummy's @SQ will become established as your 11th winner |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ns|hs|eh|hs|sh|hs|nh|at|and East will be endplayed into leading away from his @HK to give you your 12th winner. |

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


mc|12|at|The play sequence just described illustrates why it is essential not to discard any spades from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


up|15|hs|eh|nt|If East had discarded a heart (instead of a spade) on the last diamond, he would have suffered the same fate. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |

ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|Eh|pc|h8|pc|hk|pc|h7|pc|s6|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|sh|at|will result in South's @HQ becoming established |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|es|hs|ns|hs|ss|mc|12|at|as well as East being endplayed so that he has to lead away from his @SK. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|up|36|hs|eh|nt|On the assumption that East has the hearts locked up, |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|eh|hs|es|at|the only chance for the contract is to hope that East has the @SK and to play as described. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|es|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|It would be a mistake to cross to the dummy at trick 2 |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|ck|pc|c2|

hs|nh|hs|sh|at|in order to lead a heart toward the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|h3|hs|eh|at|This would give East a chance to defeat the contract by rising with the @HK. |

pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|es|pc|d8|hs|eh|hs|es|hs|ns|hs|nh|at|but the dummy would be squeezed before East (who could defeat the contract by discarding from the same suit as the dummy). |
