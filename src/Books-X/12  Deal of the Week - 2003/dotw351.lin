^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 351 - June 2, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I had a new kind of victory last week. A team that my wife, ^*BSheri Winestock^*N, and me coached came second in the ^*BUnited States Women's Bridge Championships^*N thereby qualifying to represent the USA in the upcoming ^*BVenice Cup^*N World Championships. Congratulations to ^*BCheri Bjerkan^*N-^*BSue Weinstein^*N, ^*BStasha Cohen^*N-^*BPam Wittes^*N, and ^*BRenee Mancuso^*N-^*BBecky Rogers^*N!

Sheri and I are proud to have been the coaches of this team, but it should be noted that the material we used was created by my friend ^*BEric Kokish^*N. The teams that have been exposed to Eric's coaching program have performed remarkably well and the Bjerkan Team's qualification represents yet another feather in Eric's already feather-laden cap. Thank you Eric!

During the next couple of weeks we will be presenting ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcasts of the ^*BSouth American Championship^*N, the ^*BCanadian National Teams Championships^*N and hopefully the ^*BUnited States Bridge Championships^*N (the team trials for America's 2nd ^*BBermuda Bowl^*N representatives). A schedule of these upcoming broadcasts can be found at:

This week's deal was played by ^*BMarty Bergen^*N. Marty, a 10-time National Champion, was one of America's most successful players in the 1980s. However, Marty retired from active tournament play about 10 years ago. Since that time he has demonstrated that his talents for bridge go beyond simply playing the game as Marty has established himself as one of the most popular and prolific bridge writers in the world today.

Marty's books are intended for "average players" and they are filled with the wisdom that Marty gained during his distinguished career as a player. Marty has a gift for explaining important concepts in a clear and simple manner and his unique sense of humor really comes across in his writing. The bottom line is that "average players" will not only win more as a result of reading Marty's books, but they will find themselves entertained in the process.

Within the past year or so my company converted 2 of Marty's best-selling books, ^*BPoints Schmoints!^*N and ^*BMarty Sez...^*N, into interactive software products. For a limited time we are offering a ^*Bspecial^*N deal when people buy these products directly from us. If you buy either of these software products you will receive a ^*Bfree^*N autographed book by ^*BMarty Bergen^*N (an $8 value).

nt||ls|ss|pc|SJ|hs|sc|hs|ns|at|West's opening lead was the @SJ. Rats! On any other lead, Marty would have been able to arrange to ruff a club in the dummy and easily make his contract (assuming the necessary 3-2 trump break). West's trump lead complicated matters. Think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before reading on. |

pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|ss|nt|Marty then embarked on an unusual ^*Bdummy reversal^*N by ruffing all of the dummy's hearts in his hand. A dummy reversal is characterized by the declarer taking enough ruffs in the hand with the longer trump holding such that the hand with the short trump holding ends up being the hand that is longer in trump. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|ss|hs|ns|nt|This particular dummy reversal was unusual because of the dummy's trump holding. In most dummy reversals, the short trump hand has a strong trump holding (like @SQJ10 for example). A short trump holding like @S653 is not exactly typical for employing this technique. On this particular deal, dummy's weak trumps didn't matter. Marty's dummy reversal worked beautifully - watch...|
