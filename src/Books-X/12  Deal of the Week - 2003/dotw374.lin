^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 374 - November 10, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BSabine Auken^*N in the 7th round-robin match of the ^*BVenice Cup^*N (the ^*B2003 World Bridge Championships^*N are currently running in Monte Carlo).  Sabine and her partner, ^*BDaniela von Arnim^*N, are arguably the world's strongest women's partnership.  Sabine now lives in Denmark but plays under the flag of Germany, her native country.  This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Every segment of the World Championships is being broadcast as ^*Blive^*N online vugraph through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N).  In last week's deal I predicted several records being set during these broadcasts, but the numbers we have experienced have been beyond my expectations.

As of the time I am writing this (Sunday morning in Las Vegas), we have not had 4000 people online at the same time, but we have come very close.  I would be surprised if we did not cross the 4000 barrier this afternoon.  There were over 2600 people online for the first broadcast today, and this was in the middle of the night for North Americans! About 60% of the people logged in to ^*BBBO^*N during a vugraph show have been watching one of the three tables we have been broadcasting (I suppose most of the rest have been playing some form of online bridge).

The World Championships are only about half over and I am not sure I want to think about how many people will be logged in to our site later in the week. Thanks to the efforts of my partner, ^*BUday Ivatury^*N, we know our server can handle a lot of bridge players, but we don't know exactly when it will run out of gas.  Keep your fingers crossed for us, please!

nt|In this week's deal, ^*BDaniela von Arnim^*N dealt and opened 1@S as North and ^*BSabine Auken^*N, South, responded with 2@C, an artificial game force in her partnership. |

at|After West doubled (showing clubs), Sabine and Daniela continued with a series of artificial bids (sorry - I don't know what 2@D, 2NT, or 3@S meant) ending in 3NT with Sabine as the declarer. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


pc|cQ|hs|ns|nt|West's opening lead was the @CQ (showing the @CK) and the dummy that Daniela laid down was not a thing of beauty.  While 11 HCP and a 6-card major are usually enough for me to opening the bidding at the 1-level, I would have passed with Daniela's hand (especially given that she was vulnerable against not - see the graphic in the top left corner above for the vulnerability).|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|If I had the @S10 (or maybe even the @S9) I would have opened with a weak 2@S, |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|ns|hs|nd|at|but singleton Kings give me the creeps when I have a marginal opening bid. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|ns|at|Regardless of my style in this area, Sabine and Daniela are very aggressive when it comes to opening the bidding.  For them the North hand is a clear 1@S opening and I would have been surprised to see Daniela do anything else.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ns|nt|Meanwhile, the vugraph commentators (both online and at the playing site, I am told) were wondering why it was taking Sabine so long to play on what look like a relatively uncomplicated hand. What was she thinking about? How would you play this deal if you were the declarer. Think about your answer before reading on. |

sk||hs|wd|hs|ed|at|On the actual deal, however, Sabine would run out hand entries and she would need the @DQ to be doubleton in order to make her contract. |

up|8|hs|nd|md|0,d5,,h7|
nt|If you are a serious student of the game then you have probably already spotted a better chance in the diamond suit itself. 5 diamond tricks can be won whenever that suit is 3-3 by cashing the @DA on the first round of the suit (eating dummy's @DK). |

ls|nh|ls|nc|hs|sd|hs|ed|Hs|wd|at|Then, since you would be in your hard for the last time, you would have to run the diamonds. The 3-3 break is good news, |

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|ns|hs|nh|Hs|nc|nt|The bad news is that you are going to have to make 3 more discards from the dummy. |

ls|sd|ls|nh|pc|d4|pc|c7|pc|h9|pc|h8|

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|d6|pc|h3|hs|ns|hs|nh|hs|nc|mc|8|at|the dummy will be squeezed in 3 suits. No matter what you discard, accurate defense will defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


up|26|ls|ns|ls|nh|ls|nc|hs|wd|hs|ed|nt|Of course Sabine Auken knew that the a priori odds of a 3-3 diamond break were about 36%. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


md|0,h7,,d5|at|She also knew that a priori, the @DQ would be doubleton about 16% of the time (one third of the 48% for 4-2 breaks). |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|ed|hs|wc|at|No doubt Sabine also had at least a rough idea of the degree to which West's known club length impacted the a priori odds. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|wc|md|0,d5,,h7|hs|wd|Hs|ed|nt|Yes, Sabine is good at math, but more impressively, she realized that math had nothing to do with this deal. Despite the fact that a 3-3 diamond break was more likely than a doubleton @DQ, Sabine saw the impending suicide squeeze and knew that her contract could not be made against best defense on the layout shown above.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


md|0,h7,,d5|nt|Sabine therefore decided to play for the @DQ to be doubleton. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|wd|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|I was impressed that Sabine figured this out more quickly than our vugraph commentators (who could see all 52 cards), but I was even more impressed when she ducked a heart at trick 2! |
