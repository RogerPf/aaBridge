^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 367 - September 22, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
On Thursday I received a long distance phone call from an excited ^*BMarc Jacobus^*N (Marc and I both live in Las Vegas, but he spent most of last week playing bridge in Los Angeles). "I have a great play problem for you!", said Marc. Not surprisingly, he was correct. This week's deal is the play problem that Marc told me about.

I have met only a handful of bridge players who rival Mark in terms of kindness, but I have met only two other world class player who rivals Marc in terms of speed of play. They would be ^*BAlan Sontag^*N who I played with in a recent tournament and mentioned in a recent ^*BDeal of the Week^*N and ^*BGrant Baze^*N. I like to think that eventually I might learn to play as well as these guys play, but I know that I have absolutately no hope of playing both as well as they do and as quickly as they do at the same time!

hs|ss|nt|"Suppose you open 1@S as South and West overcalls 2NT, showing exactly 5 hearts and 5 clubs", said Marc. "What kind of convention is that?" I asked. Marc's answer wasn't appropriate for a family publication like ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and, for the sake of the declarer play problem you are about to see, his answer is not really relevant.|

nt|Marc's faith in my analytical skills was touching, but misplaced as it turns out. It didn't take me long to call him back with what I thought was the correct answer. Think about how you would play as the declarer before you read the rest of this story.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|When I called Marc back, I said something like this: "I have lost one trick already and, given the bidding, it is almost certain that I will have to lose a club trick. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|A diamond loser is also inevitable as I have no way to get to the dummy to finesse in that suit. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|It appears that this problem boils down to avoiding a loser in the trump suit."|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


md|0,s5,,d3|sk||hs|es|nt|Marc continued to listen as I continued to misanalyze, "Finessing against the queen third of spades with East is not going to work. |

ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|It is true that I can force an entry to the dummy in diamonds, |

pg| ***** 17 ***** |


up|8|ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|es|nt|"No, I cannot make my contract if East has the guarded @SQ," I continued. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


md|0,sq,,s5|hs|ss|at|"My only chance is to lay down the @SA and @SK in the hope that West was dealt a doubleton @SQ.  If that doesn't work then I will either need West to have a singleton @DK or East to have a singleton @CQ." That was the end of my analysis. I awaited Marc's congratulations for coming up with the correct solution.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|ss|md|0,d3,,sq|nt|It was not forthcoming. Instead I received a question - "What is the most likely layout of the trump suit?" Marc asked. That was not a hard one. West's singleton was more likely to be in spades than in diamonds (because North-South started with 8 spades and 7 diamonds) and the @SQ was a big favorite to have been dealt to East. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|"But you cannot make 4@S if you have to lose a trump trick", I claimed for the 2nd time in 5 minutes. "You're wrong about that", countered Marc. Although Marc's statement was not immediately obvious to me, it became clear that he was correct when he explained his line of play. Can you see how 4@S can be made against the layout of the East-West cards shown above?|

hs|es|hs|ss|at|"A trump return would allow me to draw trump and enjoy my high club at the end |

hs|es|hs|ss|Hs|nc|at|With the lead in the dummy, East's remaining @SQ doubleton would then be picked up via a trump coup."|mc|10|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|ls|es|nt|I thanked Marc for sharing this deal with me as I knew that it would make an excellent ^*BDeal of the Week^*N. It wasn't until I started to write up this week's deal that I realized that Marc had made a rare analytical error (which I had missed as well when we discussed this deal). Did you spot the flaw in Marc's plan and how Marc's line could have been improved?|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


up|20|hs|es|hs|ss|nt|Suppose that, after winning the @DK, East had returned a trump instead of a diamond. The best the declarer could do from there would be to finesse the @SJ |

hs|nc|hs|ed|at|If a club was led from the dummy now, East would discard his last diamond (you can work out why this would be fatal for the declarer). |

hs|eh|hs|ss|at|A heart return from East would force South to ruff, |

pg| ***** 62 ***** |


hs|es|mc|9|at|promoting East's @SQ into the setting trick. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|es|up|47|nt|So I phoned back my friend Marc and told him the bad news. He had not given this deal any more thought during the past few days, but remarkably, it took him no more than a few seconds to figure out how the declarer could have come out on top against the above distribution of the East-West cards. You can have as many seconds as you want - do you see the answer?|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |

pg| ***** 66 ***** |


pc|hk|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|s2|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|ed|hs|Nd|at|the declarer should surrender a diamond trick to East (cashing a top club first does not hurt, but cashing a top trump first leads to defeat against best defense). It should also be noted that a low diamond at trick 3 leaves the defense without recourse if West was dealt a doubleton @DK. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |

pc|D5|pc|D3|pc|DJ|pc|DK|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


hs|es|hs|ss|nt|There is no winning defense from here, but let's assume that East returns a trump - the only play that allowed the defense to defeat Marc's original line. Declarer wins with a high trump in his hand (finessing the @SJ is an unnecessary risk) |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ss|pc|s5|pc|sa|pc|s9|pc|s3|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |

pg| ***** 82 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c6|hs|es|nt|We have seen this position before - there is no way for the defense to come to more than one trick from here. East's best defense is to ruff |

hs|eh|at|and return a heart, |

hs|nc|Hs|es|hs|ss|mc|10|at|East's remaining @SQ doubleton is caught in a trump coup - there is nothing the defense can do about it when the declarer plays this way. |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


up|40|ls|nc|ls|ss|ls|es|hs|ws|nt|Well, if the truth be told, there is something that the defense could have done. If West had found the impossible switch to his singleton trump at trick 2, even ^*BMarc Jacobus^*N would still be trying to come up with an answer for the declarer. After Marc was kind enough to share this deal with me, the least I could do would be to phone him yet again and tell him to give up!|
