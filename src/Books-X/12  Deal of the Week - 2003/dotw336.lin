^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 336 - February 17, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals are declarer play problems based on deals that took place at the recent ^*B8th NEC Bridge Festival^*N in Yokohama, Japan.

If you enjoy solving problems like these, you should consider buying ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, our best-selling educational CD-ROM. This program allows you to play problem deals at various levels of difficulty against your computer. What makes this program so good for learning (and so much fun) is that ^*BBridge Master^*N will allow you to make your contract only if you play correctly. Any mistake you make will be "punished" by the defeat of your contract. Regardless of your current level of play, using ^*BBridge Master^*N will improve your declarer play skills.

^*BBridge Master 2000^*N is really a wonderful learning tool, but since I am the author of this program (and the problem deals that it contains), you may not want to take my word for it. On the next page you will be able to read some testimonals about ^*BBridge Master^*N from various respected sources.

To find out more about ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N as well as over 20 other bridge software products that my company has developed, click on the yellow rectangle below. You will be taken to a web page in a new browser window where you can read about and/or order any of our products.

pc|H6|
at|West's opening lead is a 4th best @H6. Think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before reading on. Don't worry about overtricks.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hc|sakhaqdak|nt|Given West's opening lead, you have 2 winners in spades, hearts, and diamonds. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


lc|sakhaqdak|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|In order to bring your total up to 9 tricks, you will have to establish 2 extra winners in the club suit. Given that West's @H6 is the lowest outstanding heart, neither defender was dealt 5 cards in that suit and you can therefore afford to lose 2 club tricks (and no more than 2 heart tricks).|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cj|pc|c9|at|However, that play might not work out very well if the club finesse wins. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk||hs|wc|at|The contract will now have little hope if West was dealt 4 clubs headed by the @CKQ. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|wc|up|2|hs|nc|hs|ec|nt|The way to guard against this distribution is to duck the first round of clubs completely. The defense is welcome to win this trick cheaply. |

ls|nc|ls|ec|pc|C4|pc|C9|

hs|ed|hs|sd|at|If they return a diamond (a heart return will prevent any overtricks, but it will not defeat the contract), make sure to win the @DA in your hand |

hs|nc|Hs|sc|Hs|wc|at|By doing so you will retain communication in the club suit. This play is necessary when West started with either the distribution shown above |

nt|While the concept of ducking the first round of clubs is not that difficult, it is counter-intuitive and I don't think I have ever seen this play before. A world class player who faced a similar problem in the recent ^*BNEC Cup^*N failed to find the solution at the table. My friend ^*BEric Kokish^*N deserves the credit for spotting the correct answer to this problem. |

nt|In this week's second deal, East opens 1@H and you overcall 1@S as South. West raises to 2@H and North's jump to 4@S ends the auction. |

at|How would you play as declarer from here? |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|You have lost 2 tricks already and there is at least 1 certain loser in the trump suit. You will need trumps to break 2-1 in order to have a chance |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and you will also have to avoid losing a club trick. You must hope that East was dealt the @CK, but your chances of playing clubs for no losers are not very good if you have to play that suit yourself. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|The key to this problem is finding a way to force the defenders to play clubs for you. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|The way to achieve this is to start by leading a diamond to dummy's @DA |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|
pc|D2|pc|D4|pc|DA|pc|D9|

ls|sd|ls|ns|
pc|D3|pc|D6|pc|S3|pc|DJ|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


hs|ns|nt|Now exit in spades and hope that whichever defender wins the trick will be endplayed. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|S4|hs|es|sk||at|On this layout, for example, East wins the @SK |

hs|eh|hs|ec|at|and has to surrender a trick regardless of the suit he returns. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|sc|hs|ns|at|A heart (or a diamond if East had any cards left in that suit) would yield a ruff and discard. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|ns|ls|eh|pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|d8|pc|st|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|Hs|ec|mc|10|at|You can then finesse East for the @CK to make your contract.|

pg| ***** 55 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ec|ls|sc|
pc|C4|pc|C2|pc|CT|pc|CQ|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|Hs|ec|mc|10|at|and continue with a club finesse as before for your 10th trick. The position of the @C10 becomes irrelevant if East has to lead a club for you. That would not have been the case if you had to play the club suit yourself. |

ls|ns|ls|sc|ls|wd|hs|wc|at|His only chance is to return a club, |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|c6|hs|nc|at|but you should counter with a low club from the dummy (playing West for the @C10). |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|c9|hs|ec|at|On this layout, regardless of whether or not East plays the @CK, you will avoid losing a club trick. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|ec|up|1|hs|nc|nt|Note that if you make the mistake of playing the @CQ or the @CJ from the dummy in the position shown above, |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|cq|hs|ec|at|the defenders can prevail. East can (and should) defeat your contract by refusing to cover with the @CK. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|c4|pc|c2|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ec|hs|Wc|at|You will be left without any way of avoiding a club loser (your 4th loser) and your contract will thereby fail. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|ec|up|20|md|0,dq,,sk|nt|It should be noted that taking a club finesse before returning to your hand with the @SA cannot hurt (and actually helps on one very obscure layout). |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


up|12|ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|es|hs|ws|at|Also note that a spade switch by the defense at trick 2 leaves the declarer without recourse on this layout. In fact, I think East should figure out to overtake his partner's @HK with the @HA at trick one in order to return a trump.|
