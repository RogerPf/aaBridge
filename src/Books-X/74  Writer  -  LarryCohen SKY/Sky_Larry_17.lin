pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|p|at|and pass (players using a fancy convention like Polish 2-bids, could open this hand).|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|1h|nt||ht|c|at|Your LHO opens 1@H |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|x|at| and partner doubles.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Immediately, I am thinking of a spade game. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|I have a beautiful hand opposite a takeout double. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|4h|nt||ht|c|at|RHO jumps to 4@H. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|And you? |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||cq|1|lb|*mYour call is?^Pass~Double~4@s^3|
nt||ht|c|at|I already gave you a hint. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


mb|4s|at|You should bid 4@S. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Even if you weren't going to insist on game, now you have a 2-way shot. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|It might make or it might be a good sacrifice. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|A good rule of thumb that I use is: "When in doubt, bid 4@S over 4@H." |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|You will be right if ^*Ieither^*N contract makes. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


mb|ppp|nt||ht|c|at|Everyone passes |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


pc|hj|at|and the @HJ is led. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|what should you play at trick 2? |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||cq|1|lb|*CWhat do you play now? ^^d2^d2h7sast|nt||ht|c|at|Another good rule of thumb is: "When in doubt, set up your long suit."  |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|Whoever made up these rules must have been in doubt a lot. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hc|d2|nt||ht|c|at|Play a diamond |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


lc|d2|pc|d2ddq|at|to your queen |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


pc|da|at|and LHO's ace.  |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|sdnd|at|You want to develop diamonds |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ndsd|at|and you shouldn't worry about a diamond ruff-if they are 4-1 you have serious troubles anyway. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||ht|c|pc|hthh|at|Back comes another heart, |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


pc|s|at|which you ruff. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Now what?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||cq|1|lb|*CWhat do you play now? ^^sq^dksqs5c2|pc|sq|nt||ht|c|at|This was a tough one. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|Yes, you want to continue to work on diamonds, |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|but it must be best to play the next diamond from dummy (in case RHO started with a singleton, you don't want to lay down the king and get it ruffed). |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Furthermore, you are quite sure the @SK is on your left. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|East opened the bidding and doesn't seem to have the King or Queen of hearts (from his lead of the @HJ). |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|He must have the @SK. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|West, who jumped to 4@H could easily have shortness in spades. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|This is your way to avoid losing 2 trumps tricks. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


pc|sksas|at|The queen is covered by the king and ace. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||ht|c|sk|y|at|Now you can see the full deal. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hc|sjdj|nt||ht|c|at|You will lose another diamond and a spade, |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


lc|sjdj|at|but will make 10 tricks. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|You had to be careful to set up the diamonds and eventually draw trumps in the correct way. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|I suspect when this deal is played in the Sky Club Tournament, many will fail in 4@S. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


up|16|nt||ht|c|at|Note West's LAWful raise to 4@H - a bid which I expect will be made at most tables. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Next week we continue with deals where you (it was West on this deal) should raise to the proper LAW level.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |
