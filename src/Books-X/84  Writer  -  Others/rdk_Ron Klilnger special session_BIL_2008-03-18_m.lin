%% ---------- INTRODUCTION ----------
qx|Introduction|
fp|1|cp||ht|f|at|@4BILMANAGER: WELCOME back RON it is a privilege to have you with us today, thank you for making time to share with us.

RON: Happy to be here ...

Notes for the user:

In order to encourage the user to try to evaluate, bid and play every hand yourself a few features have been added:

   @2During the bidding only the actual hand (the one that is to bid) is displayed.

At the end of the auction only the hand of the leader is shown.

During the play you can see only declarer's hand (and dummy, of course).

You can display any hand at any time if you click on the player's name.
Double clicking the name will show all hands.

After the hand is played you can repeat it on your own playing all four hands, trick by trick.|

up|52|nt|RON: At pairs the challenge would be to find 7NT. Not easy. Well done, East-West.
Q: Would 4@C as cue bid be sensible before 4NT?
A: No, 4@C not cue-bid until trump suit has been agreed; 4@C over 3@D suggests not sure of best spot; a strong hand 4th suit.
BILMANAGER: Great start to the session - watch out world the BILlies are coming :).|

qx|P02, Board 02 Postmortem|
rh||ah|Board 02|
ah|Postmortem|
up|52|nt|RON: It was reasonable to reach 4@H and the spade break made it an unlucky hand. As West I would only invite game, but East would accept anyway. To invite, after 2@H you can bid 3@H or bid a new suit as a long suit trial, such as 2@S by West.
Q: Why would west bid 2@S?
A: It invites game in @Hs and asks for help in @Ss.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|Q: Help suit game try, right? Then I go directly to 4@h?
A: Exactly.
Q: This @S invitation is only done after you have agreed a suit, right?
A: Basically only after major suit agreement at the two-level, so after 1@H : 2@H or 1@C : 1@S, 2@S or similar.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|Q: Would you have jumped with East's hand, has 6 losers after the heart fit found?
A: No, 2@H was plenty for East, wasted @CQ; if partner could not move over 2@H, game is unlikely.

Q: Should South double?
A: No, I would not double 4@H, even though it looks a strong chance to beat it.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|RON: The @D switch was dangerous from South. I'd be inclined to take the @CA and shift to a low heart. If declarer ducks, @HQ, @H to Ace and a third @H leaves West with no chances.

nt|RON: Well bid by all. I'd be reluctant to lead the @DA, danger of setting up the K for declarer, even though partner supported my suit. Here it did not cost.

After ruffing the first diamond I'd be inclined to go for the clubs right away with @CA. You need either to set up clubs or aim to ruff a spade in dummy. You did well to reject the club finesse.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|Q: Why open one heart, why not 2@h?
A: Maybe there is a spade fit for N-S; prefer not to open weak 2, even in 3rd seat with 4 in other major.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|Q: Should N-S go to 4@H?
A: No, 3@H was just right. Without the @CK singleton 4@H would be down easily. Yet, note that 4@H was not a bad spot; that happens often when you have a 9-card fit and one partner has 10+ cards in two suits.

ah|Postmortem|
up|52|nt|RON: Advice: Avoid overcalling on 4-card suits (except if very strong suit and at the 1-level only). 2@H was way out of line. Recommended for East is to pass and when West bids 2@C you can try 3NT. After 2@H by East I'd bid 4@H as West, you can hardly be any better than this. A 2-level overcall is close to an opening hand; if reluctant to bid 4@H, bid 2@S showing a very strong raise to 3@H. That would be the expert choice.|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|Q: Why not a double by East?
A: Unsuitable for double with so much in opener's suit. If you want to do something unorthodox as East over 1@S, bid 1NT. Pass is normal when you have length and strength in their suit and not suitable for NT.

up|52|nt|RON: Advice: Do not compete a parts-score to the 4-level. Do not bid your same values twice. Having bid 3@D that was enough. You need as much strength to make 4@D as to make 4@H or 4@S. Be satisfied to defend at the 3-level.

West: Better to double 2@D to show the spades than to bid 3@C.|

A heart lead would have worked better, but I would also have chosen the @D2 lead, East. Bad luck. After that North had nine tricks. Bidding was fine. 8 tricks always there in NT, so very well stopped; also good pass by West over 1@S... 3@C or 3@D by South after 2NT would be forcing...|

up|52|nt|RON: Advice to E-W: If you Dbl for 1-suiter, then West must bid cheaply at the two-level; I suspect West was not familiar with this use of the double. Dbl of 1NT can be for penalties or have some other meaning depending on partnership agreement. Important both partners know the agreement.
East: A bit skimpy to come in against 1NT despite the good suit. About an extra K would make it OK.|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


nt|South: You might have doubled 4@S, given partner's 1NT opening and your values.
Advice to West: When you have very few trumps to work with prefer to ruff losers in dummy than to draw trumps.
South: After taking @D ace, a trump return is best to reduce dummy's ruffing power.
Nice switch to a trump, North.|

up|52|nt|RON: East: You need to emphasise your @Ds at some point. If 4@C Gerber, why not 4@C over 2@H?
Suggest: 4@D over 2@H sets @Ds for sure and asks for cues. Or: 3@C is 4th suit forcing and then 4@D over 3NT seeks @D support still. East is worth 6@D after the 1@S opening... Only question is whether 7@D is a good bet. AKQ10xxx = 7 tricks about 90% of the time... except for the pessimists in the world. After 5@C still had chance to bid 6@D.|

After @C3 to @CQ and king and @SQ to the ace, North returned the @C8, good card, to show top from doubleton.

nt|I would choose to lead the unbid suit, @Ds, or dummy's second bid suit. I know, 1@C can be short but once East fails to support @Ss, has only a doubleton there. Failure to support @Hs means not 4 @Hs, with 2-3-4-4 pattern would open 1@D not 1@C and so the bidding reveals that East began with 5 clubs. Very important to put together the evidence from the bidding. 1@C initially might be 3, but not after failure to support either major. Sounded like East was 2-3-3-5 ...|

up|52|nt|RON: Very well defended for two down after declarer slips...
Advice: Do not compete a part-score hand to the 4-level... Chance of success about 20% in our experience.
South: If available, double of 2@D would show the spades; 2@S implies 5 @Ss. If you want to show a strong club raise bid 2@H, enemy suit.|
pg| ***** 333 ***** |


nt|North: I would not overcall 2@C with that quality club suit... I do have some standards...
Recommended for a 2-level overcall is 5 suit and 3+ honours or 6-suit and 2+ honours, at least a Q-high suit. You have 5-suit and only 2 honours, not enough for me.
In the play: after @DA, @CA, @CK, should play @S10 next: set up suit before taking ruffs. That holds it to one off.|
pg| ***** 334 ***** |


nt|Kibitzer suggested finessing in @Cs after East shows 6+ @Ds; possible, not a sure thing, but a good idea.

Nice defence by E-W after N ruffs D in dummy...|

up|52|nt|RON: Suggestion: East, if you want to open 10-11 point hands, then almost all your high cards should be in your long suits. Make the @SQ the @HQ and 1@H opening is reasonable.
Great lead, North. When dummy appears, it is better to attack dummy's weaker suit, especially as West has shown no support for @Hs, but might have support for @Ds. After the super lead, I'd play the @HK to cater for West maybe having @HQ singleton.|
pg| ***** 367 ***** |

up|52|nt|RON: North suggested using 2@C. A good idea and one you do not need to agree with partner if playing simple Stayman. North bids 2@C and passes South's reply, even 2@D. Worst scenario is partner is 3-3-2-5 with 2@Ds, but the risk is worth taking. Garbage Stayman is used when you are short in @Cs and have support for the other 3 suits. Note that if North bids 2@C, South bids 2@H, probably passed out. Might make 2@H while E-W make ten tricks in @Cs.|
pg| ***** 388 ***** |


nt|If playing extended Stayman, cannot also play garbage Stayman. 1NT : 2@C extended Stayman has replies at 2-level if minimum and 3-level if maximum.

Well defended, E-W.|
pg| ***** 389 ***** |


nt|Q: Can E-W make 3NT?
A: E-W are close to 3NT but not on spade lead and @H switch.

My choice would be to overcall 2@C and bid 4@S on the next round. That way partner can give me preference to clubs when that is suitable and I have also revealed my actual minor.
West: Better to rebid 3@D than 3@H, which suggests 6+ hearts.|

"LTC" is available for Acol or for Standard American. Choose either edition.
