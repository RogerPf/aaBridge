My name is ^*BMichael^*N and my BBO User Name is ^*B'Jake'^*N. The BIL management team has asked me to do something primarily for their membership.

^b @2East won the first trick with the @HA.|
pg| ***** 266 ***** |


at| In view of the bidding, this was unexpected.|
pg| ***** 267 ***** |


at|

Since East has zero to five high card points and has just shown up with the @HA|
pg| ***** 268 ***** |


at|, it is unlikely that he has much more.|
pg| ***** 269 ***** |


at|

Having acquired lots of information, you have to decide if the ^*Bnormal^*N finesse in spades is the winning play.|
pg| ***** 270 ***** |


at| On this hand it is easy to see that your only play is the ^*Bantipercentage^*N play of leading the @SA.|
pg| ***** 271 ***** |


at| You know that East does not have the @SK|
pg| ***** 272 ***** |

Let's delve into some of the reasons for ^*B'thinking'^*N that it is a difficult game.|
pg| ***** 294 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|^b@2 Perhaps you have been told that in order to play this game you have to have the mind of...|
pg| ***** 295 ***** |


at|

Albert Einstein|
pg| ***** 296 ***** |


at|

or Bill Gates|
pg| ***** 297 ***** |


at|

or Groucho Marx|
pg| ***** 298 ***** |


at|

or Isaac Newton|
pg| ***** 299 ***** |


at|

Not true!|
pg| ***** 300 ***** |


at|

In fact, look who has become not too shabby at this game!|
pg| ***** 301 ***** |


at|

Fred Gitelman|
pg| ***** 302 ***** |


at|


The point (other than the joke about Fred) is that you ^*Bdo not^*N have to be a genius to play this game well.|
pg| ***** 303 ***** |


at| 

This is not a game ONLY for the super intelligent people.|
pg| ***** 304 ***** |


bm||nt||ht|c|at|^b @2Think about it in these terms:|
pg| ***** 305 ***** |


at|

There are only 52 cards in the deck.|
pg| ***** 306 ***** |


at|

There are only 4 suits.|
pg| ***** 307 ***** |


at| ...and to make it easier for us, 2 of them are black and 2 of them are red!|
pg| ***** 308 ***** |


at|

There are only 13 cards in each suit.|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |


at| ...and to make it easier for us, all the cards in each suit have the same 13 designations and ranking.|
pg| ***** 310 ***** |


at|

To make it even easier for us, the higher ranking cards in each suit all have pictures.|
pg| ***** 311 ***** |


at|

We don't have to play by ourselves, we even have a partner to help us.|
pg| ***** 312 ***** |


at|

We only have to count to 13.|
pg| ***** 313 ***** |


at| You must admit we do not have to be Einstein to do that.|
pg| ***** 314 ***** |


at|

We only have to remember the cards until the hand is over, normally a few minutes.|
pg| ***** 315 ***** |


at| Don't have to be Newton or Gitelman to do that.|
pg| ***** 316 ***** |


at|

If it is so mentally tough that you have to be Einstein or Newton or Gitelman to play it well|
pg| ***** 317 ***** |


at|

... then why are there millions of people around the world getting great enjoyment from the game?|
pg| ***** 318 ***** |


nt||ht|b|at|^b @2So why do ^*Bwe think^*N it is difficult?|
pg| ***** 319 ***** |


at|

Allow me to suggest the following:|
pg| ***** 320 ***** |


at|

So often, ^*Bbefore^*N we even start to learn the game|
pg| ***** 321 ***** |


at| we are told by others that this is a difficult game...|
pg| ***** 322 ***** |


at| and the sad part is we often ^*Bbelieve^*N them|
pg| ***** 323 ***** |


at| so before we even start we form this preconceived notion in our minds.|
pg| ***** 324 ***** |


at| What are our chances of somewhat mastering this game with that initial attitude?|
pg| ***** 325 ***** |


at|... not to say anything about how much fun this will be!|
pg| ***** 326 ***** |


at|

Folks, approach this fun pastime with an open mind and enjoy it.|
pg| ***** 327 ***** |


at|

Also, once we get introduced to the game|
pg| ***** 328 ***** |


at|, friends|
pg| ***** 329 ***** |


at|, partners|
pg| ***** 330 ***** |


at|, opponents|
pg| ***** 331 ***** |


at|, teachers|
pg| ***** 332 ***** |


at| and everyone else (maybe even your favorite taxi driver)|
pg| ***** 333 ***** |


at| start firing a gazillion rules, percentages and conventions at us...|
pg| ***** 334 ***** |


at| and to compound the situation|
pg| ***** 335 ***** |


at|, much of the information that we are being flooded with is conflicting|
pg| ***** 336 ***** |


at| and we don't know who to believe.|
pg| ***** 337 ***** |


at|

The first thing we know, we are asking ourselves|
pg| ***** 338 ***** |


at|, ^*B"If this is supposed to be fun, why does my head hurt?"^*N|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


at|

In my opinion, it is a ^*Bfun^*N game|
pg| ***** 340 ***** |


at| and it should be for you also|
pg| ***** 341 ***** |


at| ...not one that requires headache medication at the end of a session.|
pg| ***** 342 ***** |


at| As I said at the start of this myth, bridge is not difficult, it is simple! |
pg| ***** 343 ***** |


at| 

Well let me concede that it is challenging!|
pg| ***** 344 ***** |


tu|Y|nt||ht|e|at|^b @2
