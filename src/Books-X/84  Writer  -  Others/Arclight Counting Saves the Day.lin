nt|Not so bad. If clubs break 4-2 or 3-3, I can get 6 clubs, and 3 Aces.|

ls|ncsc|lc|hasada|pc|H2|pc|HT|pc|H3|nt|I hold up the first round of hearts in case I want to finesse in diamonds. If I lose and WEST started with 2 hearts, then I could be in big trouble. |

nt|Is it time to take a spade finesse?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at| Well, is it?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|I finessed in spades at the table for a not completely insane reason, but without actually counting the discards of EAST. 12:30 AM is not a good time for me.|

nt|What is the evidence?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||lb|*mHow many Hearts did EAST start with?^6~5~4^1^|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|WEST showed out on the 2nd round of HEARTS, so EAST started with 6.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||lb|*mHow many diamonds did EAST start with?^6~5~4~3~2^3^|nt|West showed out on the 2nd round of diamonds, so EAST started with 4|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||lb|*mHow many CLUBS did EAST start with?^6~4~2~0^4|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


lb|*mSo how many spades did EAST start with?^5~4~3~2~1^3^|at| EAST started with 6 hearts, 0 clubs, 4 diamonds, and therefore 3 spades.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|Have you been paying attention to the discards of EAST on the clubs?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at| If EAST still has 2 spades, there is a 100% play for the contract. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


lb|*mHow many spades has EAST pitched?^3~2~1~0^3^|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|So EAST has 2 spades left.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


lb|*cWhat card should South lead now?^^h8^SJH8H5C8C5^|at| So now you must lead a heart to put EAST on the lead. After hs cashes 3 top red truicks, he must lead a spade to the board into the @SAQ! |

nt|I have backed it up 7 tricks. Note that at this point, all I need to do is look for EAST spade discards. I already have a full (shape) count of the hand. If EAST holds onto 2 spades, I can lead a heart later on and EAST will have to lead spades to the board for the 100% free finesse as I just showed you!|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |

nt|However, this time, EAST will pitch 2 spades. I will then be forced to guess whether he has the @SK or not.|

nt|This time EAST has pitched 2 spades. Does EAST have the @SK ready to drop or does WEST, who started with 4 spades, have the King, ready to be finessed?|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|They only clue is the following question:|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


lb|*hWhich hand fits a 1 Heart overcall?^^2^St87HKQJ643Dk754^Skt8hkqjt54dk754|nt|MAYBE not the hand with the 9 "HCP". Without the @SK, EAST might overcall 2H. That would be one of the clues in this hand. That and the strange @ST8 falsecards on this particular deal if holding @ST8x. |
