at| In principle when one opponent opens a preempt and partner overcalls - the advancer is expected to have 7-8 points. And this is what I had: minimum points (8), 4333 shape. However, all the points were "working " points - @DA, @HK and even the @SJ - so I bid 3@s|mb|3s|

pc|dT|nt|On the lead of a diamond the contract can't be made because of the bad split in trumps - so declarer has to lose 2 diamonds, 2 spades and 1 club.|

nt|I was asked about the lead - and of course it depends on how the bidding went. I would not lead the singleton trump as sometimes that may give away a trick. Leading a club may work well in case partner has the @CQ and a side trick so that would have been my choice. The alternative would be the @d10 - passive lead :).|

sv|b|pf||sk||mb|p|nt|The first question is either to open the North hand or to pass: ten points, nice shape...|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


sk|n|at| I would suggest Pass as we are not well placed if partner responds 1@S. If the hearts were spades I might have considered opening. As it is, we may have a chance to get into the bidding later showing the shape and lack of points.|mb|p|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ub|1|mb|1c1s|sk|e|nt|If North opens 1@C, East does well to bid 1@S as his hand is not strong enough for a double first and later suit bid because of the @CQ. As a general policy: Queens and Jacks in suits bid by opponents should not be counted unless partner bids NT.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


sk|s|at| South can bid 1NT now...|mb|1n|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


sk|w|at| and West should support spades.|mb|2s|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


sk|n|at| Now North's hand should make a takeout double as there must be a fit for their side too.|mb|x|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


sk||nt|It's very hard for the E-W pair to stop in 2@s which is the limit for the hand. So this hand should be a partscore battle with N-S making 3@d or 4@d and E-W competing to 3@S.
Q: At our table it went p - p -1@S - p - 4@S - 4NT - p - 5@D - p - p - Dbl
A: I think 4@S is a bit misguided with such a balanced hand. And North should double to show 3 suits. 4NT is a 2-suiter, usually minors.|

The 4441 hand should be able to see that 3 Aces may be enough for a grand
