nt|^^^b@2West leads the @s9, won with the ace.  The contract is secure unless West has all the clubs, but East is marked with the honours in spades and diamonds, so can be endplayed.  You cash dummy's trumps, lead the @SJ, covered and ruffed, draw the last trump, cash the @CA then play a diamond to the queen.|

nt|^^^b@2West leads a spade.  You cash the top trumps and West shows out.  East must have all the missing strength; you could duck diamonds, hoping his ace is singleton or doubleton, but a better plan is to overtake the @CK and continue with the @CJ, pitching your remaining spade honour.  East can cash his trump but is then endplayed.|

nt|^^^b@2West leads the @DJ.  Best is to cash your minor-suit winners and lead the @SQ, which will guarantee a dummy entry or no spade losers if the @SK is singleton or doubleton.  Even if a defender ducks from @SKxx, you may still succeed by cashing the @SA and @HAK and exiting with a spade.  If the defender with the @SK started with two or fewer hearts, he will be forced to give you an entry to dummy.|

nt|^^^b@2West leads the @S5 to East's jack and your ace.  You cash the @CA, dropping West's queen.  The danger is that spades are 5-2, in which case you can't reach dummy with a ruff, as East will over-ruff.  You have a possible endplay, however, if East holds the @DA.  Cash the @HAK and the @SK, and lead a diamond to the king.  East can win, but is endplayed.|

nt|^^^b@2West leads the @hK.  Best is to ruff in hand.  Now cash the @SAK and @CAK and exit with the third trump, endplaying West.  (Even if East had the long trumps this would give you the diamond finesse).|

nt|^^^b@2West, who is presumably void in hearts, leads the @SK.  You must duck, to preserve the dummy entry; then you will able to endplay him if he has the @DQ.|

nt|^^^b@2West leads the @DQ to your king.  Your aim is to strip East's red cards then endplay him to give you access to dummy.  Cash the @CAK and lead the @HQ.  West takes the king and continues diamonds, East showing out.  Cash the remaining hearts then duck a spade.|
