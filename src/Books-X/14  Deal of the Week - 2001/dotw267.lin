^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 267 - October 22, 2001^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem based on a deal that was played in one of ^*BShep's Mentoring Sessions^*N on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. They don't make bridge teachers any better (or people any nicer) than ^*BShep^*N aka ^*BShelagh Paulsson^*N. Shelagh has represented Canada in several World Championships, but she has also spent a lot of time working with new players (including ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N when he was a new player).

Shelagh is offering 7 ^*Bfree^*N mentoring sessions each week. These sessions take place at 11:30 AM EDT (16:30 GMT) Monday through Thursday and at 5:30 PM EDT (22:30 GMT) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Players of all levels of ability are welcome to attend these sessions. 

The way they work is that 4 players sit down and play 3 deals of online bridge through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. Shelagh and the rest of the class get to watch all 4 hands. After each deal Shelagh discusses various points of interest and answers questions from the players and other members of the class. ^*BShelagh^*N types very fast and explains things very well. She is very sensitive to both the nervousness of new players and of the bridge egos of more experienced students.

You can find out more about ^*BBridge Base Online^*N and download a ^*Bfree^*N copy of the software by clicking on the blue rectangle below. You will be taken directly to the download web page in a new browser window.

hs|sc|nt|We know, you think the South hand looks "constructed", but this is a "real" (computer dealt actually) random bridge hand. The bidding is not real, but assume you are the declarer in 6@C after a fast and unrevealling auction. |

pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|There are 4 lines of play that are worth considering. In order to choose between them we are going to have to do a little math. The math you see here will be similar to the "ballpark estimates" that some experts are able to make at the table. The computations given in this week's deal are not meant to be rigorous or exact.|

hs|sd|nt|Fortunately, it does not take any math at all to figure out that winning the @DA at trick 1 is a good start. |

md|0,cksk,,s97|hs|wc|hs|ws|ls|ec|at|Line 1 also succeeds if West has the @CK and the @SK is singleton. We know you never get this lucky, but the cards will lie in this manner about 2% of the time. Total odds of success for line 1 are a little over 50% - not so bad. |

up|1|md|0,s2,,ck|sk|s|ls|ws|ls|wc|hs|sc|hs|nc|nt|Line 2 starts the same way as line 1, but a small club (instead of the @C8) is led from the dummy at trick 4 for a finesse. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c2|hs|ec|sk||at|This line will work whenever East was dealt a singleton or doubleton @CK (39% - half of 78% for 2-1 breaks). |

ls|ec|md|0,cks875,,skd4d2h6|hs|wc|hs|es|at|The remaining 61% of the time (that is, when West has the @CK or when East has @CKxx) declarer will need East to have a doubleton (or singleton) @SK to succeed.|

ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|es|hs|ss|hs|ns|at|The favorable spade position allows declarer to play that suit for no losers with just 1 finesse. |

ls|es|ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|wc|hs|sc|up|32|md|0,h2d2,,c53|
nt|So we saw that line 3 (leading the @CA at trick 2) will work whenever the @CK is singleton (26%). |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|sc|md|0,c3,,h2|hs|es|at|For the remaining 74% of the time when the @CK does not fall, line 2 will bring home the contract almost half of that time (that is, on most layouts in which the @SK is with East). When you work out all the numbers line 3 comes in at pretty close to 60% - a big improvement over lines 1 and 2.|

hs|sc|hs|wc|at|declarer will have to hope that the @CK is singleton (and that West does not give East a spade ruff). |

pg| ***** 68 ***** |


hs|es|at|it would be reasonable to assume (against most defenders) that the @SK was with East. |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|wc|at|It would be tempting for South to lay down the @CA at this point, but this would jeopardize the contract (for the reason that we saw before) if the clubs are 3-0 and when East was dealt at least 3 small spades to go with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


ls|es|nt|Declarer does better to continue with a middle club from his hand, conceding a trick to the @CK. If the defender's take their @CK, |

ls|sc|ls|wc|pc|cq|pc|ck|pc|c2|pc|h6|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|es|at|declarer will be left with a dummy entry as well as enough trumps to take care of East's remaining spades. |

ls|wc|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|h6|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|wc|at|declarer should continue with another middle club in order to force the defense to take the @CK. |

pg| ***** 77 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|Sc|hs|es|at|As before, there will be enough trumps remaining in the dummy to ensure that a spade trick will not be lost to East's @SK. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


hs|ec|ls|nc|up|8|md|0,h6d2,,cks5|
nt|There are a few layouts that make line 4 look pretty silly. Consider this one where East was dealt 5 spades to the @SK and a singleton @CK. After playing 2 rounds of hearts followed by a spade finesse, if declarer tries the "safety play" of a middle club he will be sorry. East will gratefully win his singleton @CK |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


ls|es|ls|sc|ls|ec|pc|cq|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|ck|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


hs|es|hs|wc|at|and give West a spade ruff. |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


up|19|md|0,s5ck,,d2h6|ls|wc|nt|As a practical matter, however, line 4 will work almost all of the 50% of the time that the @SK was dealt to East. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


md|0,sk,,ck|ls|es|hs|ws|hs|ec|at|Line 4 will also succeed on most layouts when the @SK is with West and the @CK is singleton. This works out to an additional 13% (half of one third of the 78% for 2-1 breaks). |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ec|nt|Our math departmernt tells us that line 4 is slightly better than line 3, but both of these lines are clearly better than lines 1 and 2. Hopefully you will take some comfort from the knowledge that there are very few players with the math skills (and patience) to work out problems like these at the table. Don't feel badly if this was too much for you to handle even away from the table.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|It is possible to do ballpark estimates of the odds of success of various lines, however, and hopefully this week's deal has given you some insight into how this is done. In real life there are not many points to be won in choosing between a 58% and a 59% line, but on some deals a little math can go a long way.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|Most experts, when deciding between 2 reasonable lines, prefer to use their instincts and table presence instead of mathematics. We agree with this approach completely if the 2 lines appear to be close, but sometimes computations tell us that 1 line is a clear favorite. When the difference appears to be 10% or more we will trust the math over just about anyone's table presence!|
