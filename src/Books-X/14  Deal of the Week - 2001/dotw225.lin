This week's deal is not a deal at all. Instead, we have decided to do something for those poor bidders out there who have to suffer through card play problems in roughly 95% of our weekly deals. This week we are presenting a previously unpublished convention that was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N, based on an idea he learned from ^*BEric Rodwell^*N.

As with all new conventions we discuss, this one comes with a serious warning:

cs|3|at|Suppose you have this hand and the auction proceeds as follows:

^c{|ih|psaqj32htcaqj54da4|at|}|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1hp1sp2hp?|at|}

|cq|4|lb|*BWhat call do you make?^^3c|

nt||cs|3|hs|sc|at|
^c{|ih|psaqj32htcaqj54da4|at|}|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!3c|at|}


Well that wasn't very difficult. The best contract could be a game, small slam, or grand slam, in either spades, hearts, clubs, or notrump. 3@C is the natural way to establish a force in order to get additional information from partner. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||cs|3|at|
^c{|ih|psaqj32htcaqj54da4|at|}|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!3c|at|}


|cs|3|at|Unfortunately, here are 2 very  different hands that you would bid exactly the same way:

^c{|ih|psaJ9874htdJ54caAK7|at|} ^n{|ih|psAK9642hKJ7dQ7cAJ|at|}

With the first hand you need more information from partner in order to choose between 4@S, 4@H, and 3NT. 3@C is your best bet to get the information you need. With the second hand you are pretty sure that hearts should be trump. 7@H could easily be a laydown, but if the hands fit badly even 5@H could be in danger. Once again bidding 3@C is your best bet.|

This auction is difficult for 2 reasons:

|cs|2|at|^-{ 1. Since 3@C doesn't really promise clubs, often opener will  
 have a hard time judging when to raise that suit. }
^-
|cs|3|at|^-{ 2. Since 3@C is wide-ranging in terms of strengh and distribution, often responder will 
have difficulty finding out the information he needs at a convenient level. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|The convention that we are presenting (it doesn't have a name) makes life much easier. Using this convention, 3@C in the above sequence guarantees 5 clubs. This makes it easier for opener to know when to raise clubs, solving the first problem above.

|at|When responder has at least game forcing values, but needs more information in order to select the best contract, he rebids 2@S as an artificial game force.

Most conventions, including this one, have the downside of eliminating a useful natural bid. The good news is that there are a few reasons why responder is unlikely to need a natural 2@S rebid in the above auction:

|cs|3|at|^-{ 1. 2@H will usually be just as good a partscore contract as 2@S }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ 2. Responder can sometimes strectch to invite with 3@S }
^-
|cs|2|at|^-{ 3. If the partnership is willing to use an immediate 2@S response to 1@H as a 
^*Bweak jump shift^*N, responder needs a natural 2@S rebid even less often }
^-
Still, there is a downside to this convention. Hopefully, when you read the rest of the details, you will agree that the upside is much larger, especially at IMP scoring where it is acceptable to give up accuracy at the partscore level in order to gain accuracy at the game and slam levels.|

nt||cs|3|hs|sc|at|
Opener continues after the 2@S artificial game force by describing his distribution. Several of opener's possible bids use the ^*Btransfer principle^*N so that responder can set the trump suit at the lowest possible level. For example:

^c{|ih|ps7haqj942dj3ckj54|at|}|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!2sp!2n|at|}

Opener rebids 2NT to show side 4-card club suit (and obviously a hand that was not well-suited for a 2@C rebid).

After 2NT responder has the following options:

|cs|2|at|^-{ Bid 3@C to show 4-card support }

{ Bid 3@H as a slam try in hearts }

{ Bid 3@S to suggest spades as trump }

{ Signoff in any game contract }|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||ls|sc|hs|sd|cs|3|at|
Similarly, when opener has a 4-card diamond suit, he rebids 3@C:

^c{|ih|ps7haqj942dkj54cj3|at|}|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!2sp!3c|at|}

After 3@C responder has the following options:

|cs|2|at|^-{ Bid 3@D to show 4-card support }

{ Bid 3@H as a slam try in hearts }

{ Bid 3@S to suggest spades as trump }

{ Signoff in any game contract }|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||ls|sd|hs|sh|cs|3|at|
The 3@D response to responder's 2@S artificial game force can be said to mean "none of the above (or below)". This is the bid that opener makes when his hand is not suitable for any other response. 3@D denies a 4-card minor (opener would bid either 2NT or 3@C if he had a 4-card minor).  As you will also see, 3@D denies both 3-card spade support or 7 (or more) hearts.

^c{|ih|ps7haqj942dkj5cj43|at|}|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!2sp!3d|at|}

After 3@D, responder has the following options:

|cs|2|at|^-{ Bid 3@H as a slam try in hearts }

{ Bid 3@S to suggest spades as trump }

{ Signoff in any game contract }
^-
Some people might find it easier to remember the meaning of 3@D as showing either 1633, 2632, or 2623 distribution.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||ls|sh|hs|ss|cs|3|at|
Opener bids 3@H (think "transfer" again) if he has 3-card spade support and judged not to raise to 2@S on the second round of bidding:

^c{|ih|psq47haqj942dkj5c3|at|}|cs|1|at|^n{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!2sp!3h|at|}

After 3@H, responder has the following options:

|cs|2|at|^-{ Bid 3@S as a slam try in spades }

{ Cuebid at the 4-level to make a slam try in hearts }

{ Signoff in any game contract }|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||cs|1|at|
As you have probably realized, the bids just described allow opener to show any distribution that he could have with a 6-card heart suit. If opener has 7 (or more) hearts, he bids as follows:

^-{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!2sp?|at|}

|cs|3|at|{ 3@S, 4@C, and 4@D show 7 (or more) hearts and a singleton in the suit bid }

{ 3NT shows 2722 distribution with a maximum 2@H rebid }

{ 4@H shows 2722 disribution with a minimum 2@H rebid }
^-
After any of these sequences responder can:

|cs|2|at|^-{ Sign off in 4 of either major }

{ Bid a minor as a cuebid in support of hearts } 

{ Bid 4NT as ^*BRoman Keycard Blackwood (RKCB)^*N for hearts. }

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||cs|1|at|
To summarize, in the following auction 2@S is an artificial game force. If instead responder had rebid 3@C or 3@D he would suggest 5 cards in the suit bid (and game forcing values).

^-{|ia|1hp1sp2hp!2sp?|at|}
^-
Opener responds as follows:
|cs|3|at|^-{ 2NT shows a 4-card club suit }

{ 3@C shows a 4-card diamond suit }

{ 3@D shows "none of the above (or below)" - either 1633, 2632, or 2632 distribution }

{ 3@H shows 3-card spade support }

{ 3@S, 4@C, and 4@D show 7 hearts and a singleton in the suit bid }

{ 3NT shows 2722 distribution with a maximum 2@H rebid }

{ 4@H shows 2722 distribution with a minimum 2@H rebid }
