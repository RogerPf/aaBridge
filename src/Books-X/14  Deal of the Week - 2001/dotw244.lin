The ^*BCavendish Invitational^*N was played last week at the ^*BMirage Hotel^*N in Las Vegas. The Cavendish consists of 2 events, a 3-session Swiss Teams followed by a 5-session IMP Pairs. The Cavendish is a very unique bridge tournament for several reasons, the main one being that, between these 2 events, well over 1 million dollars in prize money is available. Consequently many of the world's top partnerships and individual stars show up to play each May in Las Vegas.

Full coverage of the 2001 Cavendish Invitational, including online vugraph, is available through:

You can click on the yellow rectangle above to be taken directly to this web site in a new browser window. Unfortunately, it will cost you some money if you want to access the online vugraph. We consider this to be a serious setback as far as bridge is concerned. In our view the Cavendish is the most exciting bridge tournament of the year. The large cash prizes make this event interesting to members of the general public and it is a real shame that the tournament organizers, ^*BWorld Bridge Productions Inc.^*N, made the decision to make people pay in order to watch the online vugraph presentations (which have been free during the past 4 runnings of the Cavendish).

As usual, World Bridge Productions did a great job organizing the 2001 Cavendish, but we really think they missed the boat here. Let the tournament organizers know what you think by e-mailing:

The team captained by ^*BRoy Welland^*N of New York won the team event at this year's Cavendish. The rest of the winning team consisted of Roy's partner ^*BBjorn Fallenius^*N (originally from Sweden and now living in New York),  ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N (Toronto, Canada), Fred's partner ^*BBrad Moss^*N (New York), and ^*BHoward Weinstein-Steve Garner^*N (Chicago).

Roy and Bjorn capped off a great tournament by finishing a very strong 3rd in the Cavendish Pairs. This week's deal features a hot defense that this pair found in the second session of this event. Their opponents were 2 of the greatest players in the world today, ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N of Norway and ^*BSam Lev^*N, originally from Israel, but now living in New York.

Fred and Brad went on a very exciting ride during the Cavendish Pairs. They scored poorly in the first 2 sessions which left them in 41st place (out of 52 pairs) at that point of the event. Fred and Brad proceeded to post the top score in the next 2 sessions to climb all the way to 1st place. That was fun! Unfortunately, the last session was not as much fun as Fred and Brad slipped to 8th place, a reasonable showing, but this result was pretty disappointing for Fred and Brad given their standing going into the last session.

The winners of the 2001 Cavendish Invitational Pairs were ^*BMichel Kwiecien^*N and ^*BJacek Pszczola^*N of Poland. This pair has performed very well in several major tournaments during the past few years and in our view they are one of the very best pairs in the world right now. Some of the others partnerships in this category are also Polish - Poland has truly become a superpower of world bridge.

nt|Take Roy Welland's seat (East) and see if you can come up with the winning defense on this week's deal. The final contract was 4@S by Geir Helgemo. Geir opened 1@S (5-card majors) and then jumped to 4@S over Sam Lev's Jacoby 2NT forcing raise, suggesting a balanced minimum opening. |

nt|It looks obvious to switch to clubs, but Roy made the very counter-intuitive return of a trump! It may not be intuitive to return a trump, but it is clearly correct. If you don't see why, think about it some more. All 4 hands will be shown on the next page. |

up|32|hs|ec|nt|Let's see what would have happened if Roy had made the "obvious" club return at trick 2 (if you think Roy's trump return was an easy play then you should play in next's year Cavendish as only 2 other pairs in this prestigious event duplicated the defense that Roy and Bjorn found). |

hs|ws|hs|sd|hs|ns|nt|Geir's last remaining loser would be the @SK (his remaining diamond could later be ruffed in the dummy). Geir would wind up making 4@S, losing only 1 trick in each of spades, diamonds, and clubs. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


up|20|hs|es|ls|ws|ls|sd|ls|ns|nt|Let's now go back and see how Roy figured out to return a trump (as opposed to a club at trick 2). |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|es|hs|nd|hs|nh|hs|eh|hs|ed|hs|sc|hs|ss|at|Roy could see all 20 HCP in hearts and diamonds between his hand and the dummy so he knew that all of Geir's values were concentrated in the black suits. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|ed|ls|nh|ls|nd|ls|eh|ls|ed|ls|ss|ls|sc|hs|ws|hs|wc|nt|It looked very much like the best chance to defeat the contact was the Bjorn could win a trick in both spades and clubs and to hope that a second diamond winner  would be available to the defense eventually. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|sc|hs|ec|md|0skc3,s4cq|at|On a layout like the above, where the defense has 2 club tricks coming, Roy knew that there was no hurry to return a club - Bjorn's @CAQ were not going anywhere. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


md|0s4cq,skc3|ls|ec|ls|sc|ls|wc|hs|eh|hs|nh|nt|Roy also thought that it was very likely that there was no future for the defense in hearts. Geir had shown a balanced hand in the bidding, but if Bjorn had been dealt a singleton heart he probably would have selected that suit as his opening lead (instead of a diamond). |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|nh|hs|ws|hs|wc|hs|ss|hs|sc|nt|Once Roy had figured out some of the critical spade/club layouts for declarer and his partner |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


md|0cask,sack|at|(there was more than one - if declarer was missing the @SA and the @CK instead of the actual @SK and @CA a trump return would also be required to defeat 4@S) he simply projected how the play would go after either a spade or a club return at trick 2.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


md|0sack,skca|
hs|es|ls|ws|ls|wc|ls|ss|ls|sc|
nt|Roy correctly concluded that a trump return could be necessary to defeat 4@S and that it could never cost to return a trump. He was rewarded for his good thinking when Geir was actually dealt one of the hands that Roy had considered. Bjorn also deserves some credit for his good opening lead and his duck on the first round of clubs - this pretty defense was really a partnership effort.|
