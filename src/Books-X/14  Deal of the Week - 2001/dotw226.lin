^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 226 - January 8, 2001 ^*N }
^-
This week's deal comes all the way from Indonesia. For the past 10 years, Indonesia has been one of the strongest bridge-playing nations in the world. This deal was played by one of the first ^*BDeal of the Week^*N regulars, ^*BSyahrial Ali^*N (^*BRial^*N to his friends). Rial has been extremely helpful to us over the years in suggesting improvements to our software and in pointing out occasional errors in our analysis.

If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appear as ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, please e-mail all of the relevant details to:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N }

Our quality standards for ^*BDeals of the Week^*N are quite high, so we cannot promise to use every deal that we receive. We do promise, however, to seriously consider all submissions and to provide a personal response to anyone who takes the trouble to send us a deal. If we do use a deal you send, you will receive full credit, of course.

ls|sh|pc|dq|at|West's opening lead was the @DQ. Rial himself pointed out that his partner's 4@H bid was not best. If instead North had cuebid 2@D, the partnership would have had a fighting chance to arrive in the superior contract of 3NT. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|3NT may be a better contract than 4@H, but it is too late to worry about that. Think about how you would play as declarer in 4@H before reading on. You can assume that East has all of the outstanding high cards.|

hs|sd|nt|There are many reasonable lines of play, but the general approach that Rial took looks pretty good to us. He won the @DA in his hand |

nt|It is very difficult to decide on the "best line of play" in a deal like this one even if "human factors" (such as how often East will fail to find the difficult diamond return on the above layout) are not taken into account. |

up|19|ls|ed|ls|nd|nt|So far we have not been able to come up with a "clearly correct" line of play on this deal. If you can find one we would like to hear about it! We are sure that our friend Rial would too - he is a bridge player with the refreshingly rare quality of being more interested in the truth than learning that he was correct. Thanks for sending us this deal, Rial!|
