This years CNTC final was special for a number of reasons. It was the first bridge tournament played in Canada ever to be broadcast live on the Internet (and one of the first anywhere). It was also a great match. The Gartaganis team led throughout until Thurston took a 3-IMP lead on the third last board. The last 2 boards looked flat and it appeared that Thurston would win until Keith Balcombe and Gord Campbell produced a great effort on the second last board to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat for the Gartaganis team. It made for a thrilling and dramatic vugraph broadcast. Thanks to all the players who really gave it their all in this match!

This was the first time in the history of the CNTC that the final two teams both contained a woman player. Judy Gartaganis and Gloria Silverman proved beyond any doubt that women can compete at this level. These two want to be the best bridge players in their country, not just the best bridge players of their gender. Our hats go off to them!

Both Judy and Gloria were involved in this week's deal. This deal took play during the 3rd quarter of the finals of the 2001 CNTC. The deal has been rotated to make south the declarer.|

nt|Gloria Silverman, opened 2NT as South in 4th position. Her partner, Michael Roche, transferred to 3@S and followed with 3NT, offering Gloria a choice between 3NT and 4@S. What choice do you think Gloria made?|

lb|*MWhat choice did Gloria make?^3 Notrump~4 Spades^2|hs|ss|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|Gloria gave this matter some serious thought, but eventually opted for 4@S. We would pass at least half of the time in this situation with 4333 distribution, but there is something about this hand that says "spades" to us. The tenuous heart holding and the lack of a top honor in spades are both good reasons to retreat from notrump with this hand.|

at|Judy Gartaganis selected the @H10 as her opening lead. This appeared to be a good start for the defense as Gloria suspected that Judy would be unlikely to lead away from a King into a 2NT opening bid. To make matters worse, Michael's hand did not fit very well with Gloria's. |

up|24|hs|sd|hs|es|nt|Once Gloria tried to cash her second high diamond and Nick ruffed, there were a variety of ways that the defense could have come out on top.

hs|ss|mc|10|nt|You may not have realized this, but the declarer has just won the first 9 tricks! South's remaining spades represent a sure 10th trick and the contract will succeed. They tell you to count losers in a trump contract, but this hand was all about counting winners. Gloria saw that, but unfortunately missed the safety play to guard against a 5-1 diamond break.|
