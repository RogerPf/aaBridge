^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 275 - December 17, 2001^*N }
^-
|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BSpecial!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this Week!^*N }
^-
Both of this week's two Deals of the Week were played last week at the ACBL Regional tournament in Palm Springs, California. The declarers on both of these deals are names that you will be familiar with. ^*BBill Gates^*N played this week's first deal and ^*BWarren Buffett^*N played this week's second deal (which will be presented at the end of the first deal). 

Bill and Warren are well known as two of the most successful and admired businessmen in history, but did you know that they are both fine bridge players as well? If you did not know this already, then you have probably not been reading the newspapers or watching TV very much during the last couple of years. Bill and Warren's interest in bridge has generated a great deal of positive (and badly needed) publicity for our game. It seems that the media is interested in anything that Bill and Warren find interesting. We are very fortunate that bridge is one of the primary sources of recreation for two of the most famous and well-respected people in the world.

Warren has enjoyed playing bridge for many years and "solid" is the best word we can think of to describe Warren's game. Warren is technically very proficient -  it is very rare to seem him make a serious card play mistake. Warren's greatest strengths as a bridge player, however, are his judgment and table presence. He seems to have a sixth sense that tells him what to lead, when to double, and how high to compete. Warren has played most of his bridge in a social setting, but he is more than capable of holding his own in the tournament world.

nt||va|5|at|Bill is relatively new to the game of bridge. Bill's schedule prevents him from playing in a lot of tournaments, but he has studied the game intensely over the last couple of years and improved his skills at a dramatic pace as a result. Bill is what we would call a "creative" bridge player - he likes to try the occasional offbeat action in the bidding so that he can take note of its effect, thereby building up his pool of experience. Bill is also one of the only bridge players that we know (at any level) who is capable of performing advanced probability computations quickly and accurately at the table. It should come as no surprise to you that Bill Gates is ^*Bvery^*N good at math!

Bill and Warren spent 2 days at the Palm Springs Regional playing on a team with  ^*BSharon Osberg^*N, ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N, and Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N. Sharon, a two time World Champion, is one of only a handful of women in North America who is capable of (and chooses to) compete at the highest level in open events. Sharon has been a close friend of both Warren and Bill for many years (and a good friend to Fred and Sheri as well). Sharon has also been the primary bridge mentor for both Warren and Bill and she has contributed greatly to both their skills and their enjoyment of the game. This team performed quite well in Palm Springs, finishing 4th and 5th in two Swiss Teams events in large fields that included several of the top players in North America.

What is it like playing bridge and hanging out with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett? It is a real treat! The bridge is always stimulating, as is the discussion of the hands after the session. With the kinds of minds that Warren and Bill have been blessed with, no bridge topic is too advanced to bring up. Besides the bridge, it is wonderful just to be around these guys. They are both brilliant, of course, but they are also both very humorous, knowledgeable and genuinely nice people. All bridge players are lucky that Bill and Warren love our game so much, but Fred and Sheri feel especially privileged to be able to call such great men their friends.

ls|es|ls|ed|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|wc|at|Given the very friendly lie of the club suit, just about any reasonable line of play would have worked, but Bill's line would allow him to make his contract without any guesswork on many less favorable layouts. It would be immediately fatal for East to play a club now (Bill would then be able to win the rest of the tricks). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|ed|ls|ec|ls|nc|ls|wc|hs|nh|nt|A diamond return would also give Bill a lock as he could then discard a club from his hand while ruffing in the dummy. |

hs|nc|hs|ss|hs|sc|at|Bill would then lose a club and a spade at the most and, on the actual layout, he would wind up with an overtrick as dummy's clubs could be established for 2 spade discards. |

ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ss|up|4|
hs|es|hs|ss|nt|At the table East found the strongest defense of leading a spade away from his @SK, but Bill was able to win the trick in his hand. |

hs|sc|hs|nh|ls|ec|nt|East could see that either a spade or a diamond return would present Bill with a ruff and discard and the contract. |

ls|es|ls|ed|ls|sc|ls|nh|ls|sc|hs|ec|at|East (who could not see all of the cards, of course) therefore continued with the @CK in the hope that his partner had been dealt a strong enough club holding (@CQ10x) to give the defense a chance. |

hs|nc|nt|When it turned out that Bill was the one with the @CQ104, East's reasonable play had the net effect of giving up an unnecessary overtick (versus giving a ruff and discard to hold Bill to just 10 tricks). Bill won East's @CK with dummy's @CA |

hs|ns|hs|sc|nt|Warren chose to ruff West's club opening lead in the dummy in order to retain his @CA to control later rounds of that suit. |

pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|es|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|wd|at|He therefore turned his attention to diamonds in an effort to maintain trump control. West took Warren's @DJ with the @DA (it would not have helped him to duck) |

hs|es|hs|nd|nt|Warren had done an excellent job of maintaining control of the trump suit, despite East's strong holding. There were actually several ways that Warren could have succeeded from this point, but he chose to simply lead diamonds through East. |
