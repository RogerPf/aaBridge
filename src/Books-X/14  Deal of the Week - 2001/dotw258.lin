nt|In this week's first deal you are the declarer in 4@H after an uncontested auction. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|S4|
at|West's opening lead is the @S4 (fourth best). Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. You are playing IMPs so overtricks are not particularly important. Just try to make your contract.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|West's spade lead has got the defense off to a good start. The defenders will soon have a spade trick to cash. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|There are also 2 top losers in clubs. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|It appears that you will either have to guess the @DQ |

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|In order to guarantee your contract if trumps are 2-2 or 3-1, you have to win your @SA at trick 1. This is clearly the right play regardless of how trumps break. Nothing can possibly be gained by ducking the first trick. |

pc|H3|pc|HT|pc|HQ|pc|H4|
at|When both defenders follow to the first round of trump you could actually claim your contract. Let's go through the motions, however, and see why 4@H is now certain to make with proper play. |

pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|You should now exit in spades. Whichever defender wins this trick will be endplayed regardless of how the remaining cards are distributed. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


sk||hs|es|at|You can now see the remaining cards as they were dealt when this deal was originally played. Suppose that East wins the @SK (it is no better for him to duck to allow West to win the trick with his @SQ). |

ls|es|ls|sc|ls|nh|pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|h9|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|With only 1 club loser remaining, you can try to guess the @DQ for an overtrick. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


up|4|hs|ed|at|If East exits in diamonds instead of spades it is no better. You can win the trick cheaply and ruff the fourth round of diamonds in the dummy if necessary. You will lose only 2 club tricks at the end.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|ec|hs|sc|hs|wc|nt|Finally, if East leads either the @CA or a low club at the critical point, it is no better for the defense. Make sure to play the @C5 from your hand on this trick. The defense must win |

nt|Here is this week's bonus second deal. Once again you are South and once again you are in 4@H. This time West has opened the bidding with a 15-17 1NT. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


pc|SQ|
at|West's opening lead is the @SQ. You are lucky to have escaped a club lead, but you must play well to take advantage of this. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|Dummy's spades and diamonds will provide discards for 2 of your club losers.  |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ns|ls|sc|hs|sh|hs|nh|at|With only 2 club losers remaining, the contract will succeed unless you lose 2 trump tricks. The normal play with this combination is to finesse West for the @HQ. Good news is that given West's 1NT opening bid and his choice of opening leads, it is almost certain that he was dealt the @HQ.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hc|sakhkdkqhjdacq|nt|Between your hand and the dummy there are 22 HCP accounted for. That leaves 18 HCP for East-West. As such, it is possible that East could have the @HQ as there would still be 16 HCP left over for West.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|sakhkdkqhjdacq|nt|If you take into account West's opening lead, however, it becomes even more likely that he was dealt the @HQ. The fact that West did not lead a top club strongly suggests that East was dealt the @CK, leaving West with the remaining 15 HCP. So you "know" that West was dealt the @HQ and you should focus your efforts on not losing a trick to that card.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |

hs|ns|hs|sh|nt|Let's go back to the point at which you ruffed a spade back to your hand in order to lead a trump toward the dummy. Can you see how you could have prevented West from scoring a trick with the @HQ from here?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sc|nt|It was correct to lead a spade from the dummy, but instead of ruffing this trick, you should discard another one of your club losers. For those of you that are into nomenclature, we think this play is an unusual form of the ^*Bscissors coup^*N (a scissors coup without the count perhaps?). |

ls|nh|ls|wh|hs|es|hs|ws|md|0,c2,,s2|hs|wc|hs|ec|hs|ec|nt|The recommended play has a great deal to gain and, as a practical matter, cannot cost (on the assumption East-West are "normal" players). It is true that you might go down by playing this way when clubs were 3-3 (so that there was never any danger of an overruff). Suppose that West was dealt 3343 distribution instead of 4342. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|wc|hs|es|nt|First of all, this layout is not very likely as East (who was dealt 5 spades) almost certainly would not have passed his partner's 1NT opening. |

up|16|hs|nc|hs|es|ls|sh|ls|wh|nt|In real life it is a near certainly that spades are not 3-5 (as East would have signed off in 2@S over 1NT if he had been dealt 5 cards in that suit). It is still interesting to note, however, that the only way to make the contract on this layout is to lead a club from dummy at the critical point! If you have followed the analysis this far you should be able to work out the details!|
