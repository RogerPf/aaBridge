Both deals come from the U.S. Bridge Championships that are currently taking place in Memphis. The purpose of this event is to select the 2 American teams that will compete at the upcoming Bermuda Bowl World Championships in Bali, Indonesia. Coverage of the 2001 ITT is available through:

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N just happened to be in Memphis for business reasons last week and spent some time kibitzing the ITT. He was fortunate in that he had a chance to watch 2 of the world's greatest pairs, ^*BJeff Meckstroth-Eric Rodwell^*N and ^*BChip Martel-Lew Stansby^*N, play 60 boards against each other.

Not surprisingly, the bridge was really great and Fred was thoroughly impressed by the technical aspects, bidding judgment, and partnership skills that he witnessed. You will see some examples of all of this in the 2 deals that are presented this week. Both deals have been rotated to make South the declarer.

sk|n|nt|In this week's first deal, Lew Stansby passed as West. Eric Rodwell was dealt the 11 HCP North hand. Do you think he opened the bidding? Only North-South were vulnerable (the vulnerability is displayed in the top left corner of the diagram above - red is vulnerable and white is not vulnerable).|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*mDo you think that Eric opened the bidding as North?^Yes~No^1|
mb|1h|hs|nh|nt|If you know anything about the style that Meckstroth and Rodwell play you will not be surprised that Eric chose to open 1@H. It would be very unusual for either Jeff or Eric to pass a hand that contained 11 HCP regardless of the vulnerability and position. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|Since ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N is a family publication, you should know that we do not endorse Eric's 1@H opening for most partnerships. As Eric and Jeff play a strong club system, know that each other bid very aggressively, and tend to win zillions of tricks when they declare, the North hand becomes pretty much an automatic opening bid in the strange world of Meckwell.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nh|mb|P|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|P|an|Denies 3 spades|
nt|After Chip Martel passed as East and Jeff Meckstroth, South, responded 1@S, Lew overcalled 2@D (after having passed initially). Eric's pass denied as many as 3 spades - Eric would have raised with 4-card support and made a support double (one of Eric's many contributions to bidding theory) with 3-card support for spades.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


sk|s|mb|P|mb|?|
nt|Chip passed and it was over to Jeff (who held a pretty nice hand opposite even one of Eric's opening bids). Try to pretend you don't remember what Eric was dealt (we know all ^*BDeal of the Week^*N regulars will have no trouble recalling all 13 of his cards) and think about what you would bid with the South hand. Then think about what Jeff would bid. Don't worry if you come up with 2 different answers!|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|4S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
hs|ss|nt|Jeff chose to bid 4@S. We suspect that most players would either reopen with a competitive double on Jeff's hand or bid 3@C. Jeff is quite capable of being scientific when his judgment tells him that science is necessary, but he is more inclined to bid what he thinks he can make. On this deal, Jeff thought he could make 4@S.
|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|As you will see, Jeff was right even though 4@S may not have been the best contract opposite Eric's actual hand. If you have the judgment and trick taking skills of Jeff Meckstroth you should definitely like the concept of bidding what you think you can make. For the rest of us a slow approach on the South hand is probably best.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|Note that Jeff gave no thought toward exploring for slam despite his powerful hand. He knew that if Eric was not strong enough to open 1NT (14-16 at this vulnerability) or a 16+ 1@C, or to bid something over 2@D, then slam was not in the picture. Facing a typical Rodwell opening bid, Jeff would be very happy if he could make a game contract!|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||ls|ss|pc|DJ|hs|nd|
at|Lew led the @DJ and Eric's dummy, although meager in terms of HCP, had some useful cards for Jeff. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. Would you play dummy's @DQ at trick 1 (Lew's @DJ lead could be from a suit headed by @DKJ10)?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


lb|*cWhat card did Jeff play?^^dq^dq83|

nt||ls|nd|pc|dq|
nt|Jeff played the @DQ from dummy. He judged that Lew was a favorite to hold the @DK given his 2-level overcall and that there was very little to be gained by playing low from the dummy. If the @DQ held the trick then 4@S rated to be easy. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


pc|DK|
at|Unfortunately for Jeff, Chip covered with the @DK, putting the contract in serious danger (especially given that Lew was now marked with the @HA).|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|Jeff's next decision was whether or not he should win the @DA. Do you think he won the trick or allowed Chip's @DK to hold?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhat card did Jeff play?^^da^da5|ls|sd|
pc|DA|nt|Jeff chose to win the @DA, mostly because he could think of no good reason to duck this trick. Jeff had a plan and wanted to put this plan into action as quickly as possible. How do you think Jeff continued at trick 2?|

lb|*CWhat card did Jeff play?^^h8^skqjt7hk8ck954d5|ls|ss|ls|sh|ls|sd|ls|sc|nt||
pc|H8|
nt|Jeff made the unusual play of leading the @H8 out of his hand at trick 2! He realized that, since Lew must hold the @HA for his 2@D overcall, 4@S had very little legitimate play (as there were almost certainly 2 heart losers, 1 diamond loser, and at least 1 club loser). It was time for a swindle and Jeff just happens to be one of the most creative swindlers in the history of bridge!|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sk||hs|wh|hs|nh|nt|Jeff's swindle payed off since Lew was dealt both the @HA and @HQ and chose to duck the trick (he did not suspect that Jeff would play this way if he had been dealt the @HK). Jeff put up dummy's @HJ which held the trick!|

up|20|ls|ns|ls|sc|nt|In the 60 deals that Fred watched these pairs play, this was the only one in which Chip and Lew did not take all of the tricks that were dealt to them on defense (a useful skill to have against Jeff and Eric who do a great deal of overbidding).  Full credit to Jeff for inducing his World Champion opponent to go wrong. Lew got his revenge on this week's second deal...|

hs|ss|nt|On this week's second deal Jeff was dealt 100 honors in spades again, but this time he held an 8-card suit. Jeff was the dealer and nobody was vulnerable. What call do you think he made?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


mb|?|
lb|*BWhat call did Jeff make?^^1s|mb|1S|
nt|Jeff chose to open 1@S. While 4@S would certainly be a reasonable alternative in most partnerships, it would not be a good call for Jeff. Jeff and Eric preempt very aggressively and would open 4@S in this position with considerably worse hands. Jeff was afraid that Eric might later misjudge after a 4@S opening on such a good hand.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|eh|hs|ed|mb|P|mb|3C|an|Invitational|mb|3S|an|Hearts and diamonds|
nt|After Lew passed, Eric bid an invitational 3@C and Chip cuebid 3@S with his strange hand as a takeout for hearts and diamonds. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|eh|ls|ed|hs|ss|at|Jeff now jumped to 4@S and Lew judged very well to double for penalties. Chip also deserves some serious credit for trusting his partner and passing. 4@S doubled was the final contract.|

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|wh|ls|ss|nt|Lew's next good decision came at trick 1. He had small doubletons in both the suits that his partner had implied. The suit that he chose to lead would determine the fate of the contract.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|Wd|pc|D6|
hs|eh|hs|ed|at| Lew opted for diamonds and we think that he had a good reason for this decision. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|If Chip's hearts were considerably stronger than his diamonds he might have bid 4@H instead of 3@S. Given Chip's 3@S, Lew thought that the odds were good that Chip's diamonds were at least as strong as his hearts. Being able to think about bridge at this level is one of the reasons why Lew Stansby has been a consistent winner in major tournaments for the past 30 years or so.|

nt|If you ever get a chance to watch these 2 great partnerships play against each other, we strongly suggest you do so. We promise you that it will be a very entertaining and educational experience! Good luck to both the Nickell team (Jeff and Eric are members) and the Meltzer team (Chip and Lew are members) in the remainder of the 2001 U.S. Bridge Championships!|
