This week's deal was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N in the first qualifying session of the North American Open Pairs in Kansas City. Fred was playing with ^*BDarren Wolpert^*N, Canada's best junior player, against New Englanders ^*BDoug Doub^*N and ^*BFrank Merblum^*N when this week's deal was played. The deal has been rotated in order to make South the declarer.

Doug and Frank eventually won this prestigious North American Championship event - a popular victory as Doug and Frank are very nice guys (as well as obviously strong bridge players). Fred and Darren qualified for the final day of the NAOP in Kansas City, but they played poorly on that day and finished in 25th place. 

Fred did better in that National Open Pairs event where he was playing with World Champion ^*BSharon Osberg^*N. Fred and Sharon were in 59th place going into the last session of this event, but they had a very strong session and climbed up to a respectable 8th place finish. 

The main event in Kansas City is the ^*BVanderbilt Knockout Teams^*N. The Vanderbilt started today and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of the final of this event will be available through the web site listed above. More deals from the Spring NABC will be presented in future ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.

nt|Fred was the dealer and only his side was vulnerable (the vulnerability is indicated in the top left corner above - red is vulnerable and white is not vulnerable). Fred and Darren were playing a natural system with 5-card majors. The form of scoring was matchpoints. What call do you think Fred made as South?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^1h|
mb|1H|an|Questionable|
hs|sc|hs|sh|nt|Fred chose to open the bidding 1@H, but he certainly had no strong convictions that his choice was better than 1@C. Fred almost never opens a 5-card suit before a 6-card suit, but he judged to do so on this deal. The fact that Fred's hearts were strong and that his clubs were weak certainly contributed to this decision. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|Fred's bigger concern with a 1@C opener was that over a 1@S response he would either have to rebid 2@C (and risk losing the heart suit) or reverse into 2@H. Had Fred chosen to open 1@C he certainly would have chosen the reverse of 2@H over a 1@S response, but reversing with only 13 HCP on a possibly misfitting deal can be very dangerous.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|In any case, Fred considered this to be a very close decision. Next time he holds a hand like this do not be surprised if he tries 1@C instead of 1@H. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

at|Darren responded 1@S and then bid an invitational 2NT over Fred's 2@C rebid. Fred was now wishing he had opened 1@C. What call do you think he made now (3@C would be non-forcing)?|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^3C|mb|3C|an|Also questionable|
nt|Fred chose to be conservative and bid only 3@C. He knew that 3@C would usually end the auction, but the main alternative of 4@C would sometimes get the partnership too high if Darren had only 2 clubs or if all of his high cards were in the wrong places. Fred also thought that there was some chance that Darren would be able to raise clubs if the partnership belonged in 5@C.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |

nt|Not on this day. Everyone passed and 3@C became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


hs|nc|pc|DT|
nt|Doug's opening lead was the @D10 and Darren put down a nice dummy. 5@C looked to be a reasonable contract and Fred and Darren certainly would have arrived there if Fred had opened 1@C instead of 1@H. Meanwhile do you agree with Darren's bidding? His 1@S response and 2NT rebid are obviously correct, but what about his pass on the final round?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||lb|*MShould Darren pass or raise to 4 Clubs on the third round of bidding?^Pass~Raise^1|
nt|We agree with Darren's pass. Given Fred's non-forcing 3@C bid (and the fact that Fred likes to open light on distributional hands), Darren judged that 5@C would usually be less than a 50% contract. Getting a plus score on hands like these is critical at matchpoints and Darren did not want to risk a plus score by searching for a 5@C contract that looked to be very far away.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|Darren obviously had no idea that Fred had such a powerful hand and that Fred's bidding had distorted his actual distribution. He expected most of the field to play a club partial, however, and hoped that Fred could win more tricks than the rest of the field. It turned out that Darren was 100% right about this.|

at|Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. Remember that the game was matchpoints - don't worry so much about making your contract - just try to win as many tricks as you can.|

at|The moment of truth had come. How would you continue from this point?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ec|sk||nt|At first glance it appeared to be right to lead the @CQ now in an effort to start drawing trump. On a good day only the @CA would have to be lost and 12 tricks would be taken. On this day, however, leading the @CQ would result in 11 tricks for declarer. Frank would have been able to win his @CA |

ls|eh|ls|wc|up|4|
hs|ec|nt|Doug had already shown up with the @HK, the @DK, and rated to have an honor card in spades as well. Fred thought that Frank was a favorite to hold the @CA because if Doug held that card he probably would have taken some action over Fred's 1@H opening bid. Can you see how Fred was able to hold the defenders to 1 trump trick from here?|

hs|ws|hs|wd|at|This left Doug with no answer. If Doug had chosen to discard then the @HQ would hold and Fred could draw trump to lose only 1 trick. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wd|hs|nc|hs|wc|at|Doug figured this out, of course, and correctly ruffed the @HQ with the @C10 and Fred overruffed with dummy's @CQ to win the trick. |

nt|Fred was now able to claim the rest of the tricks. +170 would be no triumph at IMPs, but this result was well above average at matchpoints. Most of the field did play in a club partscore, but only 1 other declarer ended up winning 12 tricks (we do not know how the play went at that table).|
