The 2001 World Bridge Championships took place during the past 2 weeks in Paris. ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N attended this tournament as coaches of team USA II for the Bermuda Bowl. We are very happy to report that our team (^*BRose Meltzer-Kyle Larsen^*N, ^*BChip Martel-Lew Stansby^*N, and ^*BPeter Weichsel-Alan Sontag^*N) defeated Norway 286-265 in IMPs in a thrilling 128-board final to become champions of the world!

Fred and Sheri watched over 600 deals from this tournament in the vugraph theatre in Paris. Needless to say, they saw many fascinating and beautiful deals and some of these will appear in upcoming ^*BDeals of the Week^*N. This week's deal was Fred's favorite from Paris. It took place in the 5th round match between Norway and Poland, the eventual winners of the Silver (Norway) and Bronze (Poland) Medals in the 2001 Bermuda Bowl.

The solution to this week's deal is very difficult. Fred did not figure out the answer for himself - he needed ^*BDeep Finesse^*N (a wonderful computer program that can solve any double dummy problem) to show him the light. Norway's ^*BTor Helness^*N, the declarer who faced this problem on vugraph, came close, but in the end he failed to spot the winning line. Helness is one of the best there is so you can bet that few (if any) players, even in a World Championship, would get this one right at the table. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.|

at|^*BMarcin Lesniewski^*N, West, bid 5@D and Helgemo cuebid 5@H, suggesting a control in hearts and interest in a spade slam. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|6D|mb|6S|
hs|ss|nt|When Martens raised to 6@D, Helness made the practical decision to bid 6@S. Although this call turned out to be wrong on a double dummy basis (because East-West don't make anything and because 6@S is down on best defense), we agree completely with Helness' judgment. When either side could be making a slam, the IMP odds are very much in favor of the declaring side. |

ls|ss|ls|ns|pc|DA|
hs|nh|hs|ns|at|The opening lead of the @DA brought a mixture of good news and bad news for Helness. The good news was that Helgemo's spade and heart holdings were just what Helness had been hoping for. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nh|ls|ns|hs|nd|hs|nd|hs|nc|nt|The bad news was that Helgemo's side strength was in diamonds and, although the dummy's club holding was not hopeless, Lesniewski's double strongly suggested strength in that suit. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|nd|Hs|sc|at|The contract would depend on not losing 2 club tricks, but that rated to be difficult if both the @CK and @CJ were offside as Helness surely suspected. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|ss|nt|One additional piece of good news for Helness was that the @DA looked like a bad lead for the defense. This was indeed the case as the contract would have had no chance on the actual layout after a heart opening lead. It was clear to ruff West's @DA, establishing dummy's @DK as a winner, but the rest of this deal is much harder! |

sk||hs|wc|at|You can now see how the East-West cards actually were dealt when this deal was played. Note that Lesniewski did in fact hold the @CK and @CJ. Would your line of play have worked on the actual layout? There is only 1 solution - you should be very proud of yourself if you figured it out!|
