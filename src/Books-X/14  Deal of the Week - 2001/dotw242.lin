nt|South was the dealer and opened with a 15-17 1NT. What do you think of that?

|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|We don't think much of it, especially in an IMP game. We really like opening 1NT in general and sometimes do so with far from classic hands, but we would not open 1NT on this particular hand.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|There are several reasons why we do not like South's choice of 1NT:

1) You could miss a good 3NT. There are lots of hands that partner would pass 1NT and a laydown or very good 3NT would be missed. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|There are several reasons why we do not like South choice of 1NT:

2) You could miss a good slam. This hand has too much playing strength for a 15-17 1NT opening. Partner will sometimes raise to 3NT on hands where either 6@D or 6NT is a good spot.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|There are several reasons why we do not like South choice of 1NT:

3) You could play the wrong game. You are not going to get to 5@D if you open 1NT and 5@D could easily be a better contract than 3NT.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|There are several reasons why we do not like South choice of 1NT:

4) You could play the wrong partscore or end up defending the opponents' partscore (or game) when you should be playing the hand. Do not expect partner to judge well in a competitive auction if you start with 1NT.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|Opening 1NT could easily work out well, but we prefer a simple 1@D opening (with the plan of rebidding 3@D over a 1@H or 1@S response from partner). This course of action probably would not have worked out any better than 1NT did on the actual deal (as 3@D would fail against best defense), but the result of one deal does not really prove anything.|

at|Think about what card you would select as your opening lead against 2@S from West's (Fred's) hand (try to pretend you cannot see all 52 cards). |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||lb|*CWhat card did Fred lead?^^DT^sk53h765cat765dt3|ls|ws|ls|Wh|ls|wc|nt|Fred chose to lead the @D10, mostly by process of elimination. Experience suggests that a trump lead usually doesn't work very well against this sort of auction (especially from a holding like Fred's where a trump lead could easily blow a trick in that suit). Fred thought that a club lead was too aggressive and a heart lead was too passive. Diamonds was the only suit that was left.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |

ls|Ws|pc|sk|nt|It is true that this play could have worked very poorly on some layouts, but on the actual deal the @SK play was necessary to give the defense a chance. |

ls|ns|ls|Es|hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|nt|The position was far from clear, however, and declarer chose to make the reasonable play of a heart toward his hand (hoping to later lead the second round of trump toward the dummy). Bob inserted the @HJ, covered by the @HK which won the trick. |
