at|Welcome everybody!

I'm very happy to be back at the BIL.

Like TV series we had to make a break to prepare new episodes.

In this season I will be alternating theory and play sessions as we did in last season. I figured out we could have some new people today and maybe not all the regulars will be awake about the re-start.

So for today I have prepared a special session. That will be less formal and shorter than the usual ones just as a way to reunite and start a new season in the BIL. If things go well I will be here every Monday at the same time and hour (2:30pm EST/EDT or 18:30 GMT).

So if we have newcomers the purpose of this sessions is to explore bridge without considerations about playing level or experience. I strongly try to make things easy to follow for beginers but not very boring for advanced players. I not always succeed in that :).

Questions are always welcomed and debating is open at any time (open chat is fine).

I'm also open to suggestions for topics you want to learn. If you want to suggest topics please contact BIL manager at admin@@bilbridge.com and let her know your proposals. I'll try to prepare things based on what you request.|

ht|e|at|@4What do we do today?

As I said today will be a non-formal and shorter session with the idea of having some fun to reunite in our monday adventures.

The concept I will introduce today is:

^-{What you do in one board may have a significant weight in the next one.}

And the best way to illustrate that principle is to review the all-famous

^-{Grosvenor gambit}

pg| ***** 3 ***** |

Now the public should be split between two groups:

Group a: "Oh I know this"

Group b: "What the hell is this guy talking about?"

Pick a group now :)
|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
Those in "b" will learn something special today.

Those in "a" will have some fun (I hope).|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ht|e|at|@4I will start explaining what the Grosvenor Gambit is and why it should be promptly renamed.

Back in the 70's a great player named Fred Turner developed the idea around a particular play. He showed his creation to the world in the Bridge World magazine in a very creative way (to see the original article click here: ^*Hwww.bridgebum.com/grosvenor.php^*N|fp|1|
at|).

He created a fictional bridge player named Philip Grosvenor and presented his ideas thru the eyes of this character.

The play is known today as "The Grosvenor Gambit" because that was the title of Turner's original article.

So I think it is time to rename it "Turner's gambit" and have the real person behind the idea named :).

So did you know a play in the official bridge encyclopedia was named after a fictional character?

Now you know :)

sk||up|52|nt|"So what?". Declarer made against Grosvenor the same number of tricks any other delcarer would have made. What is the difference?|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at| The difference is that this declarer got mad :). He could have made 12 tricks but to do that he had to assume East made a very gross mistake.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
You should be thinking "Luis has been taking strange things during his leave. What is this all about?"|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|The idea that Turner developed is that sometimes you can make a mistake so gross that no one will believe you. So the result will be exactly the same as if you would have played in a normal way, with the difference of the strong psychological effect in your opponents.

pg| ***** 66 ***** |


at| But this layout is impossible from East's point of view, because declarer wouldn't have played in this way!|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at| So East assumed declarer had @sAQ doubleton and 3 diamonds and playing a diamond would be fatal if declarer has @dJxx. Declarer needs to lose 2 diamonds when he has Jxx unless East switches to diamonds.|

East will say: "I can't believe he did that!"|

nt|There are many many examples of this in action. The keys are:

- the result is then the same as if you had played in a normal way;
- but the opponent had a chance that no one had at the other tables.

ht|e|fp|1|cp||at|I've been a victim of this gambit several times, I confess.
Q: ... and gone mad?
A: Yes, of course!

pg| ***** 134 ***** |

I remember one particular board that I went down in a pedrestrian 1NT that I could have made, just because a defender tried to let me win the hand.

I didn't believe it, of course, so instead of taking a finesse that worked I played a exotic squeeze that didn't work. The result was down 1 in 1NT.
|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |

Partner said: "Why don't you take finesses as most normal players do?"
I said: "He had the setting trick and didn't cash it... Why would he... He can't... "Grosvenor!"

Of course, the defender didn't know the play, he was just asking: "What is a Grosvenor? Did I forget to cash a trick? Sorry, partner!"

All that discussion created a strong effect in my mind. I forgot to bid 3NT in the next deal and played 3@d making 7. Partner asked if that was a bidding Grosvenor hoping they would reopen 3@d with a double.

So if you see one of this when you play, or if you see the chance to do it, remember it will be a great tribute to Fred Turner, the man that invented the play and is not named.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |

Turner's article ends saying that Grosvenor's body was found weeks later at a lake with his fingers broken and bruises on his head and shoulders :).
|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |

Several people believed this was true and mailed Bridge World saying that killing a person for what he did at the table was not right :).
|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |

Even today a good number of players think Grosvenor was a real player and not a fictional character from a great mind. So if you hear something said something about "Grosvenor", be picky and correct him, tell him the real inventor was Fred Turner :).
|

I think this play will last forever in bridge history. And it is so particular that I know it will never be a topic for a lesson, because I have to admit it, its merit is very arguable.
|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |

But it is the first tip of the iceberg about psychology in bridge and how what you do can have unexpected effects in the current board or maybe in the next one.
|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |

One of the theories I have is that sometimes you can make a bid that is a mistake just because you know the opponents will not take advantage, so then was the bid a mistake or tactical bid?

It is always fun to know this and I'm happy I could show this as something new to many of you.

We'll try to explore this things in this season here in the BIL, but not today.|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


ht|e|fp|1|cp||at|@4If you see a Grosvenor in action, write it down. Maybe in our last lesson this year we can have a review of the Grosvenors we saw or did.

I hope this was fun enough as a way to resume our weekly adventures and I promise we'll be on more serious topics in the next encounters.

I'm sure nobody starts a series of lessons with the Grosvenor gambit :), so be prepared for the unexpected :).
