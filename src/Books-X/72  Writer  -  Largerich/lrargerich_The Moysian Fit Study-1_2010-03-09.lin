at|   @2^z@3Maureen Hall |fp|2|at|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO:

^b· Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.

^b· Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice.

^b· For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project - the BIL Library - was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

ht|h|cp||fp|2|at|   @2Welcome everybody!

Today we'll begin to study the Moysian fit. Moysian fit is declarer's 7-card (usually 4-3 or 5-2) trump fit. It is named after Alphonse Moyse Jr. who (in certain situations) strongly advocated opening 4 card majors and raises with 3 card support(1).|

Before proceeding to the topic I will make a short introduction about why/how you can end up in a Moysian fit.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|h|fp|2|at|@4In partscores you can end up in a Moysian fit when:

^b· The hands are a misfit;

^b· A player decides to open a 4 card major for some reason;

^b· A player that is supposed to support with 3 supports with 2 for some reason;

^b· A player that is supposed to support with 4 supports with 3.

We've been there, done that :).
|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
In game contracts when you don't have an 8 card fit in a major and 3NT is unplayable the first alternative is normally a Moysian fit in a major when you don't have enough power for a 5@c or 5@d contract. Sometimes 11 tricks is just too much and the 10 trick game in @h or @s is better. At MPs 5@c and 5@d are normally bad contracts so players always try to play a 4@s or 4@h game in a Moysian fit first: 10 tricks in @s scores 420 while 11 tricks in @c or @d scores 400, at MPs that's too a big difference.

So we'll end up in a Moysian fit from time to time and we need to know how to play it.
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
The idea is to study the play of the hand and not the bidding, so we'll try not to be very picky about the bidding in our examples. In some hands we'll just place the contract without any bidding.

I will only present three examples today, and there is a good reason for that: most Moysian fit contracts can be split in two categories. So I will explain those two categories and present an example. Then I will let you study that, reflect and in two weeks we'll do more examples based on those 2 categories.|

Students: Duck hearts until dummy can ruff.

lrargerich: Very good. We can just refuse to ruff until we are out of hearts in dummy. Then if they insist on hearts we can ruff in dummy keeping 5 spades in hand to draw trumps.|

nt||fp|2|at| @2This sacrifices some overtricks if spades are 3-3 or 4-2 but we said it was IMPs, so no problem.

Student: What if playing MPs?
lrargerich: If playing MPs you just ruff a heart and hope trumps are 3-3 or 4-2.
|

Student: A 6-0 trump split defeats the contract... which is 1%, yes?
lrargerich: I'm not sure about the actual number but nothing can be done about it, so we don't care.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| @2Student: Declarer has top trumps - dummy can overruff 4th @D and make 5@ss + 1 ruff + 3@Ds + 1@C = 10 tricks. But that requires long @Ds in hand with 5 trumps: if West has only 2 @d, playing @d is not good - so it's better to duck hearts 3 times.
lrargerich: Yes, that's right.

Student: What if dummy trumps are not high?
lrargerich: If hearts are 5-4, no problem. If you think hearts are not 5-4, you could as well ruff and play for trumps  4-2 or 3-3.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| @2Student: Would another line work as well, but on the same principle, I was thinking: discard @c on second @h, draw two trumps and now when you see the danger start on diamonds?
lrargerich: It's too late, because they ruff a diamond and play a heart and you are always behind in trumps. You can never draw trumps because they run hearts. They will be ruffing winners until you are down and you can never draw trumps, yes it's terrible :).|

at|Students: 4-2.
Very good, 4-2 is the most likely break. So we are most likely going down 1 :).|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| @2It is hard to see where we can make an extra trick if trumps are 4-2.
Nothing from clubs.
Diamonds may be, but we need a lot of luck in the suit.
That's what we can think if we attack this hand in terms of keeping control.
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|So what happens if we are not interested in keeping control? Can we make 8 tricks in some way with ruffs?
|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


at|Students: Try to ruff @H in hand with small trumps.
lrargerich: Very good. We can try to make 6 top tricks and 2 ruffs = 8.

lc|sAK53hacAKdA|
nt||fp|2|at| @2This goes against several things we "know": 
^b· Ruffs with the long trumps are not good - we always try to ruff in the short side. 
^b· Losing control of trumps is bad.
|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|Yes, if we ruff twice in the long hand, we will lose control. But the key is that ruffing hearts, even in the long trumps, we'll be making tricks we can't make otherwise.

If trumps are 4-2 we can't make 4 trump tricks drawing trumps. We have 5 trumps, if we lose 2, we make 3 tricks. But ruffing can lead us to 4 tricks instead of 3. Let's see it.|

^b· We didn't want to draw trumps.

So in "chaos" declarer loses control of trumps in order to make enough tricks with ruffs, sometimes in the short hand, sometimes in the long hand sometimes in both. The key is that we can't make the contract playing for "control".

So we'll have two lines of play: "control" and "chaos".

ht|h|cp||fp|2|at|   @2In the upcoming lessons we'll continue with the Moysian fit. 

We'll always try to classify the play in control or chaos and based on that we'll plan the play. It's easier if we have a meta-plan to know what needs to be done. 

Since 90% of the hands fit in those 2 categories, knowing them well will help us a lot to lose fear in the Moysian fit.

After the complete series you will start supporting with 2 or opening 4 card majors to practice and then we'll have created a monster :).

Student: A Moynster :).

Thanks a lot, see you all next week!|
