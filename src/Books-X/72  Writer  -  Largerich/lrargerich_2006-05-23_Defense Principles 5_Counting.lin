nt|Welcome everybody. Today we are going to wrap our series about defense. We began this journey some time ago with some basic defensive principles focusing in the philosophy of a good defender and some common recipes that you can use to defeat contracts.|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


nt|Then we studied defensive signals, how to use them and how to read them.

Today we are going to explore yet another facet of defense, which is counting and making deductions about the bidding and play.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|This is certainly the hardest aspect of the defense and the skill you will want to learn the most. Once you learn how to count the hand and visualize the hands defending is a lot easier. When you don't know what is going on then declarer has the advantage since he is seeing more cards than you.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|We will be in the South seat in this journey so focus in the South's hand. We will be "reasoning with South" in all the examples.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |

pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|In the bidding East has shown a 5-5 hand with the majors and dummy (West) has preferred to play in hearts. So dummy has longer hearts than spades. When this happens we usually think about leading a trump to prevent declarer from ruffing spades with dummy short trumps.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|We do that with the purpose of protecting our spade tricks, in this example having Txxx of spades. It is clear that declarer doesn't need to ruff spades in dummy. Declarer's spades should be quite solid since we have 4 of them and no honor.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|So this means that with KJxx of spades we would have lead a trump to protect those spades. But with Txxx of spades leading trumps just doesn't make sense. Remember: when you lead trumps to stop ruffs it is because either you or pd has values in the suit you don't want ruffed.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|The auction suggests that declarer may draw trumps and use spades to discard minor suit losers. We think that because we have xx in trumps and xxxx in spades. So we may need to cash our minor suit winners before they disappear.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|With that in mind we plan to lead the A@d, the card that will let us see dummy and decide how to continue.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


pc|DA|pc|D2|pc|D4|pc|D3|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|Now we can examine dummy and proceed to plan the rest of the defense.
We have said that declarer had 5-5 in the majors. That means declarer has only 3 cards in the minors. Can be:|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|1) 1 diamond and 2 clubs or 
2) 2 diamonds and 1 club or
3) 3 diamonds and no clubs. 
It can't be 3 clubs and 0 diamonds since everybody followed to the A@d :-).|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|When you face a situation like this one, when there are different likely scenarios and they are not a zillion, you can do what I call a "mini-simulation". You will think: "OK we have these scenarios, what will work in each of them"?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|Sometimes you will discover there is one play that works in any scenario and then you can be sure you are going to make the right play. When different plays work in different scenarios use the play that works more times. So let's think:|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|1) If declarer has 1 diamond and 2 clubs no more diamond losers for declarer. If declarer has the A@c we may think we gave him a free finesse, but that is not right since declarer can always discard the 2nd club on the K@d. So playing a club would be right.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|2) If declarer has 2 diamonds and only 1 club then no more diamond losers for declarer. If partner has the A@c declarer loses a club. If declarer has the A@c he doesn't.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|3) Finally if declarer has 3 diamonds and no clubs he is going to lose 1 or 2 diamonds and can't discard them anywhere.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|So what we observe is that a diamond play can never work and a club play always work. There is no scenario where playing a club would be wrong and there is one scenario where playing a club is 100% needed.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|Since we need partner to have the A@c we can play the K@c. If partner has the ace, great. If declarer had the A@c nothing lost, declarer could discard a club loser on the K@d.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |

nt|Partner encourages as if we needed :-)|

pg| ***** 22 ***** |

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|This example introduced counting, making inferences and simulating scenarios for the defense. It's simple but a lot of new concepts. So let's stop for a round of questions. Fire at will :-)|
nt|Q: I don't see why it's a claim -1
A: After the defense takes the first 3 tricks there is a heart loser for declarer.
Q: Show me how you force that.
A: If he plays A@h and K@h he loses the Q@h. If he plays the J@h North covers and then the 9 @h is good.
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|Q: You said you had to cash minor tricks fast to avoid declarer drawing trump and discarding losers on spades. But you know west has plenty in both minors and not so many hearts, so did you really need to cash A@d?
A: He has 3 or 4 hearts for the 4@h raise. The problem is you can't tell before leading if you can cash 2 diamonds and 1 club, or 1 diamond and 2 clubs or maybe 3 diamonds and no clubs.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt| So leading the diamond ace covers all the possibilities.

Q: Are there any techniques to make **seeing the hands** easier, or counting?
A: To see the hands the easier trick is to take a peek. When you can't do that you should practice a lot :-).|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|Q: If North has the A@c, it's as expected, if East has the A@c the hand is underbid and NS will get the IMPs.
A: I don't think 2@h with 16 is an underbid. 2@h is forcing. 2/1 in SAYC is forcing up to 2NT so West can't pass 2NT.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|Q: Right, but when you get down to playing the hand, if East has that ace, he takes overtricks?
A: Overtricks don't matter at IMPs.
Q: Is the 4@d from North asking for @c shift?
A: The 4@d just discourages in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|Q: If East has A@c and no K@s, does @C shift give the contract?
A: No, because the club loser goes away on the K@d. If there is a club loser it can't lose and it may win, that is a watermark of a good play :-)|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|Q: What is 4th loser, please?
A: A heart is the 4th loser. Missing QT9xx unless the queen is doubleton you always lose a trump.
Q: If East goes to West with spade and leads J@h?
A: North covers with the Q@h and then the heart Ace can't drop the ten and nine at the same time.|

nt|Remember we are always South. EW reach 4@h again. A 2nd try after we defeated 4@h in the previous hand.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


pc|C3|pc|C2|pc|CA|pc|C6|
nt|Partner leads the 3@c, declarer plays low and of course we win the ace.

The lead is a clear singleton for several reasons. The first reason is that only the T@c is missing, with T3 partner would have lead the ten and not the 3. But that is not the strongest reason.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|The strongest reason is that partner is leading a suit that dummy bid twice. So if the lead is not a singleton then we have a worst problem than this hand (think: partner). Whenever partner leads a suit that the opponents have bid think about a singleton.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|So now we think about a defensive plan. We have the A@c, a club ruff for partner and we are going to make the K@h too. That is very nice but adds to just 3 defensive tricks: 1 club, 1 ruff and the trump K. We can't defeat 4@h with 3 tricks so we need another one.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|There are 3 chances:
1) Another club ruff
2) Partner having the A@d
3) A spade trick.
|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|As before, 3 scenarios that we need to evaluate. So we will think how likely each scenario is and what will work in each of them.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|Let's start with the first scenario: A second club ruff.
For that to work we need an entry and the only entry we have is the trump K. So we need declarer to take a trump finesse and we can give partner a second club ruff.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|We note that scenario doesn't depend on us, it just depends on declarer missplaying the hand: taking a trump finesse instead of playing A@h and another. So whatever we do is irrelevant in that scenario.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|The next scenario is titled "Partner has the A@d". In that scenario declarer can't discard his diamond losers without drawing trumps. And since we have control of the trump suit we have nothing to worry about. When partner takes his club ruff he will cash the A@d or we can play a diamond when we win with the trump K. What we do now is again irrelevant.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|The third scenario is "We have a spade trick", either the A@s or the K@s in partner's hand. In that scenario if we play a club now for partner to ruff he will be unable to play spades from his side. So he will exit with diamonds and then declarer playing A@h and another heart will make the hand since clubs provide discards for the spade loser.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|So "RED ALERT"! If we have a spade trick we need to play spade right now. The club ruff can wait since we have the trump K. As long as partner has 3 trumps declarer can't draw trumps without giving us the K@h and when then give partner the ruff. On the bidding it is quite clear declarer has only 5 hearts.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|So in one of three scenarios we have to play a spade, and in the other two what we play doesn't matter. So a spade can't lose and in one scenario is the only play that works! Spade 2 to the table.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


pc|S2|pc|S8|pc|SK|pc|S4|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |

mc|9|
nt|The keys in this hand were:
Planning for 4 tricks before giving partner a ruff
Thinking about scenarios
K: so tempting to return club on 2nd round!
A: Yes, but that destroys the defensive chances|
sc|y|sk||
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|K: you are a delight to listen to Luis
A: ty :-). Questions ?
Q: how long have you been playing bridge ?
A: For about 15 years. I started when I was 17. And I'm 32 now. Lost a lot of hair in the process. I think bridge is bad for hair :-)|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|Q: Playing @s could only be wrong if West has @s AKJx right?
A: No, not even then. You mean declarer can play 4 rounds of spades discarding the diamond from dummy?
Q: Yes|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|A: That is really really very unlikely, because from declarer's point of view that would go down a lot of times. For example whenever the heart finesse works that strange play would go down 1 automatically.|

mb|1S|
nt|Q: How can u open with 11 pts?
A: I have 9 not 11.
Q: Why not 2@s open? Isn't 2@s better opener here?
A: Opening 1@s this hand not vul vs vul is about automatic. I can have JTxxx, xx, xxx, xx for a 2@s opening white vs red.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|Things that partner won't expect if I open 2@s are: a) A hand that may open 1@s; b) A side ace; c) A sixth spade; d) A side queen; e) A nice hand; f) Good suit, etc.

Q: Partner won't expect 6 spades for weak 2?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|A 7 loser hand with 9 points and 6331 with spades is fine to open 1@s light. We are white vs red in first position. If you were in the lessons about preempts you would remember this is a position where we preempt very agressively.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|We may open 2@s with 5 cards and 0 points for example. In 2nd position vulnerable this is ok for a 2@s opening for example. In first position white vs red my preferences are 1@s or pass if partner hates opening light. 2@s is very missleading for partner.
K: for your partner :)|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|K: I like 1@s lot for the instructors reasons.
A: When trying to evangelize people about opening light I always say something like this:
If you open 2@s here and something goes badly, for example missing a cold slam, partner may say "I never expected a side ace" or "Trumps were too good" or "Yikes that side queen was not normal".|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|When you open 1@S partner can't say anything unless he can refute your "What would you do with an extra queen? If I have an extra queen 1@s is normal and yet we get the same result"
Partner can't say anything about that. So whenever you are a jack or a queen short for opening 1@s then 1@s is probably better than 2@s. The queen or J you are missing for a 1 level opening can't make a big difference.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|And what you have extra for a 2@s opening can be a problem. For example partner may defend to 6@s if they bid 6@h and your side had 2 aces to cash :-)|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|Q: You only open light with majors?
A: Yes. I open with 11 with a 5 card minor, but not with 10 or 9. I have a bad episode of 6@s down 1 after opening 1@d with 10 in a world championship. Where the 1@d opening had realy nothing to do but you always think things might be different if you passed.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|So tired of playing 4@h down one EW try 3NT this time.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|SQ|
nt|And we lead the spade queen, quite an automatic lead.|
pc|S6|pc|S4|pc|S2|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|So the Q@s wins the first trick and now it is time to think. We can get a lot of interesting things from dummy and the play at trick 1. Let's start with the spade position: partner can't have a spade honor. With Kx or Ax he would have overtaken the lead and play a second spade. He won't block the suit on purpose we did nothing bad to him yet :-). So declarer has AK of spades.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|Now from the play of the first trick we can also get the following information: partner must have an entry, either the A@h or the K@c. If declarer has the A@h and the K@c then he wins the first spade, knocks the A@c ace and claims making 5 clubs, 2 hearts, 2 spades and 1 diamond for 10 tricks at least.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|Declarer is ducking because he needs to give the lead twice and he wants partner to be out of spades when he wins the lead. Very clever declarer :-). If we play a second spade now, partner won't be able to continue spades when he wins the lead. Therefore playing a second spade doesn't make sense. We don't have enough entries to knock both spade stopers and cash the spades.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|Since playing spades doesn't make sense we are going to switch. So we need to decide what switch we make.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|Hearts will be OK only if partner has AQTxx of hearts and then we can play hearts now or when we win the A@c, there is no hurry.
In diamonds instead we may need to switch right now. Partner may have the K@d and maybe K8 or K9. So the correct play is the T@d to capture dummy's J@d.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|We reasoned that: a) Declarer has AK of spades; b) Partner has an entry; c) Continuing spades can't work; d) If hearts are right they can wait; e) So we have to play diamonds; f) Playing the T@d to capture dummy's J@d seems right.
So we throw the T@d to the dance floor.|
pc|DT|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|And declarer is not happy. Now 3NT is always down 1 no matter what declarer does.|

pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|Questions?

Q: Was 3NT wise without having @d stopped?
A: I think 3NT was a practical bid. Balanced 4333 hand with 2 spade stoppers and partner overcalled 2@c. If 3NT doesn't work probably nothing works.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|Q: I would have overcalled 2@h, I don't see the 3NT, and I want to know what I don't see.
A: 2@h over 2@c is a 5 card suit. 3NT over 2@c is a lot more logical than 2@h with just 4 cards.
K: West is more like to have xx,xx,AQx,KQJt9xx than the actual hand.
A: Even in the actual hand 3NT will be made against unalert defenders.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|3NT is the game where most imps are won because it can be cold and then it is good and it can be down and they missdefend.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|Q: What if declarer wins 1st spade lead, draws C K, ducks spade return?
A: Then we have the A@c and all the good spades. Spade ace first, north wins the K@c and plays another spade. South plays a third spade and the stopper disappears.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|Q: Would North give count on spade lead?
A: No, that is not needed. At trick 1 the signal is almost always attitude except in some special ocassions that we have studied in a previous lesson.|

pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|The opening lead is a problem. A heart looks wrong into the player that made a cuebid. Clubs with AJxxxx seem wrong too. Diamonds from Jx can be very dangerous, leads from jack-nothing are always a problem. So with many many doubts we decide to lead a trump.|

pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|Clearly declarer had a singleton club. Why would he play the queen to the king if he had two? So a club now would give declarer a ruff and sluff. Seems we have to play a heart and hope partner has the Q@h but let's count before proceeding.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|Declarer had 6 spades and he also had 3 diamonds, that is 9 cards. If declarer has only 1 club then he has 3 hearts. And even if we give him a ruff and sluff he can only discard one heart from the 3 cards and will lose a trick to our K@h. Then the ruff and sluff is harmless and a heart may be costly specially when there was no ruff and sluff.|

mc|11|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|Sometimes our bridge senses will fool us. But if you count, the count is always right. 
Things as "he wouldn't have played in this way if..." or "I thought you had ..." or "Don't you asked for a ..." may be wrong but the count of the hand can't be wrong.
So whenever you think you have to do something try to count before. You will discover your assumptions are not right many times.|
sc|y|sk||
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|Questions about this one?

Q: Why didn't North signal even count in @c? Makes it easier for partner.
A: It doesn't matter what North signals. The ruff and sluff can't hurt. And if declarer has another club the club play can't hurt. So a club is always right.|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|Q: Trying to remember how you can tell declarer had 6 spades, not 5?
A: Because he draw trumps in 2 rounds, we had 1 trump, partner had 2 and dummy had 4. Therefore declarer had 6.|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|Counting is not easy, it is probably the most difficult skill even for experienced players. And it is the skill that most energy consumes. It takes times and creates headaches.|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|Q: 2@s is good rebid for West? Better than 3@s?
A: With 16 and a singleton K I like 2@s. 3@s is almost always 18-19 balanced with 4 spades of course. So 2@s is either a 11-14 balanced hand or promises a singleton, playing strong NT, of course.|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|Q: Why 4NT without knowing a diamond stopper?
A: 4NT may be wrong without the diamond control, but partner opened 1@D and East wasn't going to believe that partner had no diamond control when he has AQ in hearts and the club Q and KJ of spades and partner opened. Maybe partner opened with AQ of spades and AK of clubs but oh well :-).|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|Q: Cue bid always shows 1st round control, e.g. 4@C?
A: No, cuebids are either 1st or 2nd round controls. If cuebids are only 1st round controls asking for aces doesn't make sense because you already know :-). 4NT RKCB and 1st/2nd round cuebids make sense. And it's what about 90% of the players play today (maybe more).|
