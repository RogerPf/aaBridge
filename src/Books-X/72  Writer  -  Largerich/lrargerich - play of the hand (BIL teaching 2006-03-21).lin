nt|So we start with an interesting example. A balanced hand with spade support and 13 HCP. Many people play a 3NT bid as 13-15 4333 but that is not really SAYC standard.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|2C|
at| So I'm going to start with the SAYC wildcard bid: 2@c and please note I could have 3 or 2 clubs for this bid.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|
at|
Partner has a balanced hand and I have 4333 so 3NT is usually a lot better than 4@s.|

pc|D4|
nt|A balanced hand facing a 4333 hand should play 3NT even with an 8 card fit in a major.
Q: Why?
A: Because the chances of getting tricks with ruffs is zero and in 3NT you need 9 tricks instead of 10. One of the advantages of a trump contract is that you can create winners ruffing losers in the short trumps. When you have 4333 that disappears and 3NT starts to be a better contract.|

nt|We have a 11 HCP count here with 5432 distribution. That is good for opening in my style. I will open 1@c because partner is not a passed hand and I don't want to bid my suits in an artificial order, planning to rebid 2@c over 1@s of course.|

This has been a fantastic way to show how light openings can help when you and your partner bid well and trust each other. Very well bid: cuebidding 4@h and waiting for a 4@s cue to bid 4NT.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|Q: You all were cuebidding?
A: Yes, both 4@h and 4@s were cuebids.
Q: But I had @sA so what did 4@s cue?
A: You cuebid a CONTROL not an Ace.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|Q: Is it normal to cuebid a singleton?
A: Yes, Aces, Kings, singletons and voids are controls. The modern trend is that singletons and Kings are controls. The school that cuebids Aces only is very old. You have 4NT to ask for Aces. So cuebidding only Aces would be redundant if you later ask for Aces with 4NT.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|Let me say it in this way: The purpose of 4NT is to check you are not missing 2 Aces to play a slam. The purpose of cuebidding before 4NT is to make sure they can't cash AK of a suit against your slam. That is why an Ace, King, singleton or void work when cuebidding and showing controls: you make sure they can't cash AK of a suit.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|In this case when I bid 4@s partner was sure they didn't have a casheable AK of spades.
He didn't know if 4@s was the A@s or a singleton, but he knew after bidding 4NT.
He knew we were missing 1 Ace but they can't cash 2 quick tricks. So the slam was good.
If I can't bid 4@s they can cash AK of spades so partner just play 5@d.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|I think 4NT is an easy and healthy convention in any format even for beginners. And that's why I think that cuebidding Aces only makes no sense, because you are going to ask for Aces later anyway.|

nt|As you saw before I open many 11 HCP hands and thus I open any 12 HCP hand. If you open with 11 you can't pass with 12 because your partner will need psychiatric care.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|I will comment about the choice of 1@c or 1@d to open. There are 2 schools for opening a minor. One school opens 1@d only with 4 cards and then 1@c can be a doubleton with 4=4=3=2. The other school opens the best minor so 1@c can never be a doubleton. I'm quite in the middle of both schools. With xx in clubs I would open 1@d. But with xxx in diamonds I will always open a club even with 2 cards.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


mb|1C|
nt|So I play "best minor with reserves". With just Qxx in diamonds I think opening 1@c with Ax is OK. Wouldn't mind a 1@d opening but I liked 1@c here.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|Q: Speaking of psychic can this be viewed as psychic bid although had good @c stopper?
A: No, a psychic is a great distortion of what you show in your bid and what you have in your hand. Opening 1@c with Ax when you promise 3 is not a distortion. In fact Ax is better than 762 for example. For example with @d AKx and @c T762 I would open 1@d. With @d Jxxx and @c AKx I would open 1@c.|

nt|Seems we will be defending this time :-).
While they bid it is good to make a picture of the distribution to think less when the auction is over. So West has 5+ hearts, and East 4+ spades so far.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


mb|2S|
nt|Now West has 4=5 in the majors for the 2@s raise, probably not a 16+ hand because he didn't jump. So I expect 11-15 with 4 spades and 5 hearts in West.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|
at|
Q: How many hearts can East have?
A: East should have something like 6-9 with 4 or 5 spades.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|Do I have to balance here? I might bid 2NT to ask partner to pick a minor, but maybe East has 4=2=4=3 or 4=2=3=4 and we don't have a minor suit fit. I don't think I want to force partner to bid a minor at the 3 level. It is probably right not to let them play 2@s, but the risks to move them out of their confortable 2@s partscore are maybe too high.|

nt|The raise with 3 cards in spades is unexpected because East can have just 4 spades. With a balanced 5332 hand it was better for West to rebid 1NT over 1@s.

The lead wasn't a great success, declarer starting with QJ of clubs.|

It's interesting to discuss with partner how strong 3@c is when there is a Double in the middle. Some people will say the Double makes the 3@c bid stronger, others will say it is lighter.|

nt|This hand was good for a support Double instead of 3@c. The strange thing is that partner has "supp X" in his profile. You can't blame somebody for not doing something they don't know or play but in this case.... :-)|

North: ok, partner, tell me how it should have gone.
A: You can make a support double instead of 3@c. Support XX in this case when they Double.|

nt|In third position with 9 HCP and a singleton, opening 1@c to suggest a lead seems to be a good idea.|

at|.. or a spade :-). When your partner opens in third position with a light hand (as seems to be the case here) you should lead his suit because the opening is precisely done to suggest a lead not because you wanted to be funny and open something.|

nt|I have no idea about what partner is doing here. Lead a spade instead of a club, then play a 2nd spade but then switch to hearts... Maybe declarer is blocked and can't enter dummy. That would explain not playing another spade.|

Kibitzer1: On @c lead contract would make.
Kibitzer2: Not bad defence i think :)).|

nt|This was our last board, thanks a lot for playing and/or kibitzing. The score isn't imporant at all. You play 6@d that they don't find at other tables, did you win 6 imps or the other players lost them? :-) Points are just an indication of what your score is relative to the field just that.
Kibitzer: At every level... novice to experts... this is a great show... pity the poor who aren't here... ty Luis and BIL!|
