fp|2|ht|e|at|@4^b@2BILmanager: @D@D A warm welcome BARNET to the BIL, it is a pleasure to have you do this session for us today. 
Welcome to Barnet's guests who will be joining us: Magshen1 - Barnet's lovely wife, handp, vivian1, 8025glw, voicy.
The session is most suited for Improving/Upper Intermediates and BIL Graduates.

barnets: Welcome to everybody. Thank you to Maureen Hall for inviting me to do this lecture. Also thanks to Miksa and Peterb370 at BIL for coaching me in bridge movies and how to show them.

OK let's go everybody - fasten your seatbelts!

As it is my first presentation I want you all to enjoy it. Therefore while there are some important ideas on teaching  there is also a strong accent on entertainment. I have been working on some new presentation ideas which combine some learning ideas with entertainment for the student.
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|
A few hands shown are from "Put yourself in the Hot Seat" a lecture I am currently giving allowing the student the chance to find the winning play at the critical point in the hand. I feature the hands and stories on a full size cinema type screen and there are pictures of the players in their seat positions. If you like what you see here send me an email BridgeIdeas@@aol.com and you can get on my mailing list to see more presentations and also free access to my first Website, Shenkinbridge which will be up  shortly. Constructive comments are also welcome sent as an email.

I now live in USA but originally from Glasgow, Scotland.
This is my first presentation on BBO so I ask you to put up with occasional blips that are likely to occur.
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
Today the main focus is on opening leads.

A bridge teaching book will tell which card you should lead from various holdings on opening lead. I like to help student's think perhaps in a different way from the way they normally do.

So today I would like you to give yourself an idea of what the four hands round the table look like before you lead. This different type of approach may be difficult to grasp at first but if you can make a start today you will reap the benefits in the future.|

fp|2|ht|e|at|^b@2The Scene: Selfridges, London, 1933. A USA team play a British team for the Schwab Trophy.

For USA: Ely and Josephine Culbertson, Teddy Lightner, Michael Gottlieb.

For UK: Henry Beasley and Sir Guy Domville, Lady Doris Rhodes and Graham Mathieson.

Graham Mathieson was a good friend of my late father Louis and I remember having dinner with him in my house in Glasgow  when I was about 12 years old.

A large periscope was used by spectators outside the playing area to follow the play there were so many people trying to watch.

Culbertson did more to publicise bridge than any other person and did an enormous amount to improve the popularity of the game. Perhaps, his wife Josephine was the stronger player.

fp|2|at|While the result of this hand was not a success the USA squad went on to win the match.

A recurring theme on opening leads is to try and picture as well as you can the four hands round the table before you make your lead.

I can take a couple of questions...|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||
fp|2|at|Q: I thought lead maybe should have been the @cJ?
barnets: No, the choice from that is always high the A or K or low.
|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|
Q: If he leads high diamond might be better, then he knows his @sK is safe, @hK is safe and clubs?
barnets: Diamonds is the opps suit steer well clear. Clearly the @CA or @CK, then shift to a spade to kill dummy's entry. Then declarer can't establish the @D suit and goes a few down.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||
fp|2|at|Q: Can he get back in with @hs eventuallly?
barnets: Eventually will be a lot too late.
|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|Q: The "always discard from the top of a sequence" rule... Does this apply only to NT?
barnets: No. When you have a sequence and want to discard, discard top.|

fp|2|ht|e|at|^b@2I spotted the idea for this hand in an opening lead book by Hugh Kelsey and John Matheson.

Both Scottish, the late Hugh Kelsey is in the very small group of people who rank amongst the world's best ever bridge book authors.

John Matheson was a teammate of mine in days gone bye....

pc|HJ|
fp|2|at|Your RHO may be a gambler but he would not be foolish enough to try 7NT with any apparent clear loser in his hand. That means his heart holding must be the ACE singleton. The safest lead to ensure a two trick set is the HJ.
|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at|
Declarer has what he thinks is 13 running tricks. He must either have clubs, diamonds or less likely but possible spades. Ergo, he can't have hearts. So the safe lead in the hand to put the contract down 2 is the @HJ.
|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|
You could lead the @HK, which could result in the contract going down several more or 1 less if dummy has the Q.|

fp|2|nt|Q: Why do you think long minor? Is it because he would show long major?
Q: It is possible he could have 10 spades to the AK and 3 aces?
Q: I can't see why "he cannot have hearts" but - it is just the only way to beat the contract - so why double?
Q: Why not lead a low @D?

barnets: OK, please...|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


fp|2|nt|barnets: He cannot gamble 7N without what he thinks are 13 running tricks. That means NO losers. Not the AQ of hearts, which has a loser. He can have a long suit in diamonds, clubs or less likely spades. He cannot have hearts for the reason I just explained.

fp|2|at|Perhaps Hamman should have guessed the winning lead due to the underlying idea. Here Chemla had cue bid 2H to show first round heart control. If Hamman was convinced Chemla had first round heart control he should have led a spade.
|pc|sA|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


at|
It would seem a spade lead was indicated unless the brilliant Chemla was preparing a ruse, a ploy to persuade Hamman to lead a spade when in reality he had no spades and one heart.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


fp|2|nt|Of course, as well as trying to fool Hamman with his lead would also fool his partner during the bidding.
The clue in this hand is that with a choice of cues you usually cue your first round control. In these days a cue bid showed generally first round control. The tip here is that hearing the cue bid of 2@H South should lead the @SA. Are we all OK on that?|

nt||fp|2|at|Q: Why didn't East take the @HK, then trump his third heart?
barnets: He could have trumped his third heart, yes, but put youself in declarer's shoes: he sees 2 club LOSERS and 2 diamond LOSERS. He takes his only chance as he see it: to pitch a @D loser on a @h WINNER.|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at|Q: Why wouldn't he finesse that @C lead?
barnets: Very good question. He did not finesse because he thought I held a singleton and would lose the first 3 tricks and either a ruff or a slow second club loser.
|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


at|Q: Why would he think of a singleton - nothing in the bidding, and the likely break would be 3-2, not 4-1? Just because of the lead?
barnets: Well, my LHO opened 1@C. Of course, it could have been a doubleton club. Had I a doubleton club declarer's play was the only chance to make his contract. Can everybody understand that?

at|In any event whatever the lead the contract could not be stopped from making!|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at|My tip to you all is that you should play the Dbl of a slam to ask for an unusual lead; not to increase the penalty, but to tell partner not to make his normal lead. Make sure before you double, if you get the lead you want, you have a chance of another trick somewhere to beat the contract.
|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


at|
Q: When does a double indicate to lead first bid suit, please?
barnets: The opening leader leans towards dummy's first suit. The Dbl asks partner not to make his normal lead, so it steers him towards dummy's first suit or a long suit which would not be construed as the normal lead. Sometimes even experts get it wrong, but better to have it than nothing.|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at|Winning 12 imps on that board reduced the deficit to 18 and was part of a remarkeable set of hands when we went on to win the match!

As well as the tip, the last hand was inserted so I could finish on a high note with a good memory I always enjoy replaying.|
