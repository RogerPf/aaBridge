pg| ***** 15 ***** |


n#|5|
at|^^Now we   "Look at"   ^*b each suit ^*n  in turn,  looking for any techniques that might yield extra trick(s).|

at|@s  Spades  -  lead low to the  @sJ.  This has a 50% chance of making 1 extra.   But will ^*b always ^*n lose one to the @sQ^^@2^e ALSO   we have a chance of a  3-3  split for a  "long suit"  trick   (but that is only 36%)|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


Lg|n|
at|^b@2^^@h  Hearts  -  The lead gives us a 2nd @H  OR  we can lead the @hJ to knock out their other hon and promote the @h10|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|^^@d  Diamonds  -  no chance of extra|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|^^@c  Clubs     -  Clubs are interesting.     Can you see the ways by which, we could make extra club tricks ?|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
n^|5|
Lg|c|
at|In  @c  Clubs  we can @2finesse the Queen (by leading low to it)   AND 
if the suit then breaks 3-3 we can get an additional 2 extra @c tricks by  "length of suit". |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


Lg|n| 
at|^^^b@2^dThis would give us 3 tricks   -   a successful finesse of  @cQ    AND    2  long clubs.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


n#|7|
at|^^^*bAre there any potential problems ?^*n|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|         Yes -  think again about the club suit.           Hint think entries.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
n^|5|
Lg|j|
at|As we need 3 extra tricks (and can only risk losing the lead once),  so we have to try for them from  @c's.   |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|^^But it should be easy  -  win this trick  -  take the @c finesse  -  duck a round of clubs  -  get back to hand when they (say) continue hearts and lead a low club ........|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|  can you see the problem ?|

at|Whenever a deal is showing and you can see the  blue  {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n}  button  in the bottom right, clicking on it takes you into "into" that deal  and the same buttom now called  {^*b Back to Movie ^*n}   will return you back.

Once you are inside a deal you have full control you edit bidding, play   OR  play against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots. 

On the ^*b left ^*n hand side in the Green Baize area you will see three buttons as illustrated below.    Note the third button "Review" will shown differently as it will, at that time, be "selected".


{^*b Edit ^*n}  let's you explore the deal 'double dummy'.   Click a ^*bCARD^*n to play it.   Use  {^*b Undo ^*n}  to unplay cards.

{^*b Play ^*n}  let's you play the remaining cards (against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots).

{^*b Review ^*n}  (the default)  let's you run back and forth in the existing play.     Use ^*bStep,  Flow^*n and ^*bNavbar^*n. 


Inside a deal you can at any time save the deal and play as a  ^*b.lin^*n  file, use       |cp|red|at|^*bMenubar    >   ^*uF^*n^*bile   >   Save As ^*n|cp||at| 

^b^dPlease move back to the previous page and click   on     {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n} |
