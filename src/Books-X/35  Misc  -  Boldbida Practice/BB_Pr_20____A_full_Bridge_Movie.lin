ht|e|

at|Whenever a deal is showing and you can see the  blue  {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n}  button  in the bottom right, clicking on it takes you into "into" that deal  and the same buttom now called  {^*b Back to Movie ^*n}   will return you back.

Once you are inside a deal you have full control you edit bidding, play   OR  play against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots. 

On the ^*b left ^*n hand side in the Green Baize area you will see three buttons as illustrated below.    Note the third button "Review" will shown differently as it will, at that time, be "selected".


{^*b Edit ^*n}  let's you explore the deal 'double dummy'.   Click a ^*bCARD^*n to play it.   Use  {^*b Undo ^*n}  to unplay cards.

{^*b Play ^*n}  let's you play the remaining cards (against the ^*b aaBridge ^*n bots).

{^*b Review ^*n}  (the default)  let's you run back and forth in the existing play.     Use ^*bStep,  Flow^*n and ^*bNavbar^*n. 


Inside a deal you can at any time save the deal and play as a  ^*b.lin^*n  file, use       |cp|red|at|^*bMenubar    >   ^*uF^*n^*bile   >   Save As ^*n|cp||at| 

^b^dPlease move back to the previous page and click   on     {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n} |
