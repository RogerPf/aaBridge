bt||nt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #172|nt|
This week's deal is a declarer problem based on a real deal from a recent matchpoint game. Most of the North-South pairs declared either 4@H or 5@H and made either 10 or 11 tricks. 12 tricks were possible on the actual layout. See how many tricks you would have won.

We are pleased to announce that the screen text of the Deal of the Week software is now available in Swedish. Thanks to Thomas Larsson for providing the Swedish translations. If you would like to see another language added to the software or have suggestions regarding a langauge we support, please e-mail:

nt|The opponents are vulnerable and you, sitting South, are not (look in the top left of the above picture to see this - red is vulnerable, white is not vulnerable).

lb|*MWhat is the correct call on the South hand?^2 Clubs~2 Hearts~3 Clubs~3 Hearts~4 Hearts~Pass~We have no idea^7|

nt|This is a very difficult bidding problem as both hand evaluation and tactics must be considered. Just about anything could work, depending on the other 3 hands (and the other 3 players).

pc|DK|

nt|West's opening lead is the @DK. When the dummy comes down your first thought is that you have missed a laydown slam. 4@H is not in any danger, but at matchpoints you would like to win as many tricks as possible. At first glance it appears that the only possible loser is the @CA.|

South still has a trump left and the club suit is unblocked. He can claim the rest of the tricks, making 4@H with an overtrick.|

OK, so 11 tricks were not that hard. We are now back at trick 2, having been forced to ruff a diamond at trick 1. Can you see how 12 tricks can be made?

|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|In order to win 12 tricks on the actual layout, South can play one round of trump at most, but then he must play on clubs. We think that ideally the club suit should be played at once |

When both defenders follow to the first round of trump you can claim 12 tricks and expect a good matchpoint score.|

We like the club play at trick 2, and on this particular day, this play wins all the matchpoints.|
