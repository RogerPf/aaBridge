Responder's Forcing Notrump
^-|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3When the opening bid has been in a major suit and responder is not a passed hand, the one notrump response is conventional.

It has a wide value range of 5+ (a good 5) to 12- (a bad 12) HCP and it is forcing for one round.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|

The older standard was that this response was not forcing and showed only the lower half of the new range (5+ to 9- HCP).

When responder bid at the two level it showed 9+ or more HCP.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

Since the new standard requires responder to hold game forcing values to bid at the two level, (12+ HCP), both the range and nature of the one notrump response have been given new meaning.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


fp||at|
If opener's rebid is in the same major at the two level, it promises six cards in length and shows values in the minimum range of 12+ to 15- HCP.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

A jump to the three level in the original suit shows a good suit of six or more cards and the values of 15+ HCP, but not enough to insist on playing game.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

A jump to four in the major suit shows a good enough suit to need no support, and that facing minimum response values, ten tricks appear probable.|

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ha|y|md||nt|^B@2^Z@3When opener rebids in a minor suit after a forcing notrump response, that suit will frequently be only three cards long.

When opener's distribution is 5-3-3-2 there is no real suit to rebid.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3A rebid in the lowest ranking minor suit of at least three cards is normal.

This rebid can be in a four card suit, but four is not promised.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In fact, if the opening bid has been 1@H and opener's distribution is 4-5-2-2, the standard rebid will be in the two-card Club suit.|

When responder's values are minimum for the ^*bforcing notrump^*  response the rebid must show this value range. These are the things that responder can do:|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at|

^c1.) Take a preference to opener's major suit at the two level to show a doubleton in 
^Csupport. 

^cIf opener has first bid Spades and has rebid in Hearts, responder will take a 
^C"false preference" and return to Spades with exactly two Spades and three Hearts, but 
^Ccan pass with three Hearts and two Spades.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |

^c2.) With minimum values and no fit for opener's major suit, responder can pass the suit 
^Cof opener's rebid. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|

^cWhen opener has rebid in a minor suit and responder does pass, unless responder is 
^C4-4-4-1 with shortness in opener's major suit, the pass will show five card support for 
^Cthe (minor) suit of opener's rebid. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


at|

^cResponder is aware that opener's rebid will often be in a three card minor suit, and in 
^cone specific auction the rebid of Clubs after an opening bid in ^*BHearts^*  could be a 
^Cdoubleton.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|

^C3.) Responder may introduce a new suit at the two level. 

^cThis guarantees at least five cards as well as minimum response values.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |

^C4.) If responder introduces a new suit at the three level without jumping, this hand can 
^cbe in the minimum range. 

^cThe suit will be at least a good six cards and responder knows that if this suit is not the 
^ctrump suit the hand will have little or no value.|

More About the Forcing Notrump
^-|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3After an opening bid of 1@s and a ^*bForcing Notrump^*  response, opener will frequently rebid 2@c.

If responder then bids 2@d or 2@h, it shows a five card or longer suit, shortness in Spades, and minimum vallues (5+ to 9- HCP).|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


at|

When a minimum opening  bidder holds a fit of two or more cards for responder's suit, pass will end the auction with no problem.

However, when opener holds no fit, pass would usually lead to a bad result.

Unless responder holds a six card or longer suit the defense holds more trumps than the declaring side.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


at|

With a singleton or void in responder's suit, it is standard for the opening bidder to remove responder's suggested contract and continue with the auction.

When responder holds only a five card suit, this action is prudent.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3However, when responder holds a six-card or longer suit, opener has unknowingly made a mistake.

A five-one fit is not usually playable, but a six-one fit will usually play reasonably well.

Opener has no way to know which action is correct.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


at|

This problem has been addressed at the expert level, an a conventional solution has been proposed.

The solution was suggested by East Coast expert Les Bart, and the convention that results is named for him.

Our presentation of this convention is by guest expert Mike Passell. |

Transfers After the Raise of the Forcing Notrump
^-|
pg| ***** 199 ***** |


fp||at|
Opener's raise of the ^*BForcing Notrump^*  promises balanced distribution (usually 5-3-3-2) and 18 or 19HCP.

It is almost forcing to game facing any minimum response.|
pg| ***** 200 ***** |


at|

When the eventual contract is in notrump , responder will declare, but if the contract is in responder's long suit, it is right to have opener become declarer.

To achieve this end, most experienced partnerships use transfer bids at responder's second turn.|
pg| ***** 201 ***** |


at|

Responder's continuation to 3NT is natural.

However, all new suits at the three level transfer to the next higher suit.|
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


at|

If responder's new suits were natural they would not be forcing.

The use of transfer continuations allows responder to control the auction and stop in a part score when necessary.|

When the ^*bForcing Notrump^*  has been raised and responder has that hand, certain distinctions can be made:|
pg| ***** 216 ***** |


at|

1. Responder can transfer back to opener's major, then bid 3NT.

This should show scattered values in the other suits and no ruffing value.

Opener can elect to play 3NT rather than the major suit game.|
pg| ***** 217 ***** |


at|

2. Responder can transfer to a suit which includes a concentration of values, then show the major suit fit.

This may then again allow for a contract of 3NT rather than the major suit fit when responder's concentration bolsters opener's weak doubleton.|
pg| ***** 218 ***** |


at|

3. Responder can transfer to opener's major, then show a side source of tricks.

This should be a good five card suit, usually with two of the top three honors.

Knowledge of the trick source may be all opener needs in order to bid a slam.|

THE MECKSTROTH ADJUNCT TO THE FORCING NOTRUMP
^-|fp||at|
^-by Jeff Meckstroth
^-|
pg| ***** 243 ***** |


at|^B@2^Z@3
The function of the Meckstroth Adjunct is to clarify opener's hands which are worth a game forcing jump shift rebid.

Current practices cause responder to wonder about opener's suit lengths.|
pg| ***** 244 ***** |


at|

Sometimes the opening bidder will have five cards in his first suit and five cards in the suit of his jump shift as well.

If this were always known to be true, responder would have an easy time showing support for either suit in continuing a search for a slam.|
pg| ***** 245 ***** |


at|

Unfortunately, opener's distribution is not always clear.

Holding a 7-3-2-1 pattern or a 6-3-3-1 pattern, opener may have mad the jump shift in a three card suit.

If opener is 7-2-2-2 the jump shift might even have been made in a doubleton.|
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


at|

When responder has a fit for opener's first suit there is little or no problem, but when responder has no fit for opener's first suit, the auction becomes more difficult.|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3My solution to the problem is to assign a conventional meaning to opener's raise of a ^*bForcing Notrump^*  response.

When opener raises the ^*bForcing Notrump,^*  responder is next required to bid 3@c with any hand which does not have support for opener's first suit.|
pg| ***** 248 ***** |


at|

If respnder instead continues by bidding four of opener's major suit, this shows a weak hand with support for the suit.|
pg| ***** 249 ***** |


at|

Responder's plan was to discourage opener by taking a preference to that major suit after a rebid in a lower ranking suit by opener, or pass if opener simply rebid the first suit at the two level.|
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


at|

If responder continues by bidding three of opener's major suit, this shows a hand with three card support, limit raise values, and no side suit shortness.|
pg| ***** 251 ***** |


at|

There are only two hands with which responder would have used the ^*bForcing Notrump^*  while holding a fit for opener's major suit fit.|
pg| ***** 252 ***** |


at|

When responder does not have a fit for opener's major suit and when opener raises the ^*bForcing Notrump^*  response, responder next bids 3@c to allow opener to describe the game forcing hand.|
pg| ***** 253 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Opener's next calls are as follows:|
pg| ***** 254 ***** |


at|

1. If opener repeats the major suit, this shows a single suiter at least six cards long.|
pg| ***** 255 ***** |


at|

2. If opener next bids 3@d, this shows exactly four cards in Diamonds as well as at least five cards in the first suit.|
pg| ***** 256 ***** |


at|

3. If opener next bids three of the other major suit, this shows exactly four cards in that suit as well as five or more cards in the first suit.|
pg| ***** 257 ***** |


at|

4. If opener next bids 3NT, this shows exactly four cards in Clubs and probably only five cards in the major suit. 

If the major is six long, it is not a suit good enough to play facing a singleton in support.|
pg| ***** 258 ***** |


at|

5. If opener next bids 4@c, this shows exactly four cards in the Club suit and six or more in the major suit.

This also stipulates that the major suit is good enough to play facing virtually no support in responder's hand.|
pg| ***** 259 ***** |


at|

It follows that opener's jump shift rebid in a suit after the ^*bForcing Notrump^*  promises at least five cards in each of the suits, thereby allowing responder to support the second suit when there is no fit for the first suit and three card support for the suit of the jump shift.|
pg| ***** 260 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Any partnership which adopts this conventional addition to the use of the ^*bForcing Notrump^*   will need agreements to replace the traditional meaning of the raise of the ^*bForcing Notrump.^*|
pg| ***** 261 ***** |


at|


It is suggested that when opening bidder holds 17 or 18HCP in addition to the five card major suit, the rebid should be as with a minimum hand, in a three card minor if necessary.|
pg| ***** 262 ***** |


at|

With 19HCP and the appropriate shape (usually 5-3-3-2) opener can instead raise the ^*bForcing Notrump^*  to 3NT.|

In Volume I mention was made that the 1NT response to a major suit opening by a passed hand is no longer forcing, but that its strength range does not change.|
