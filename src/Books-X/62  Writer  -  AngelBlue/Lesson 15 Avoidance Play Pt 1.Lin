tu|y|
fp|1|cp|2|
ht|g|at|^bWhen a defender threatens to run a long suit against you, there is an obvious danger.|
ht|h|at|^bThe idea is to keep the danger hand off lead, so it is important to know who is the danger hand and why.|
ht|i|at|^bYour first goal is to correctly identify the dangerous opponent and to recognize the way he can damage|
ht|j|at|^byour game. Next you should try to find out what might be the effective way to prevent the danger hand|
ht|k|at|^bfrom gaining the lead.|
ht|m|at|^bA Guideline for all the hands including in this movie:|
ht|n|fp|1|at|^bBe always on the look-out whether or not a defender may risk your game by taking control of the led suit|
ht|o|at|^bor by shifting to a vulnerable suit.| 
ht|p|at|^bBefore playing to trick one, recognize the dangerous opponent. This will give you the ideas about:|
ht|q|at|^b1. Whether or not it is essential to hold up to exhaust the short-suit holder of his cards in the led suit.|
ht|r|at|^b2. How to proceed with your play to prevent the dangerous opponent from gaining the lead.| 
ht|t|at|^bThe movie designed to allow you first to make your plan with defenders' hands closed.|
ht|u|at|^bUse this ^$40 arrow to get the auction and the opening lead, and this ^$41 arrow to move to the next deal.|
ht|v|at|^bThen you will find the same set of deals with all four hands visible. This will allow you to check whether|
ht|w|at|^byour plan was correct and to play through all the possible variations, including the defense options.|
ht|x|at|^bLater, you may go to the last page to find the solutions.|

ht|f|at|^bDeal 1: It is not a safe plan to hold up in spades. When spades break 5-3, West can hold up his @SA on the| 
ht|g|at|^bsecond round of spades to preserve communications. Then, if a diamond finesse subsequently loses to either| 
ht|h|at|^bhand, the defenders will take a total of four spade tricks to beat the contract. Win the opening lead, cross to|
ht|i|at|^bDummy's @DK and run the @D10 into the safe West hand.|
ht|k|at|^bDeal 2: West is the dangerous hand because a heart lead through your vulnerable King might be fatal if East|
ht|l|at|^bholds any combination headed by the @HA. To guarantee your game, win trick one and finesse the @D10.|
ht|n|at|^bDeal 3: After winning the @HJ East becomes the dangerous hand because he can lead through your @HK.| 
ht|o|at|^bCross to the clubs at trick two and run the @SJ. If the Jack holds run the @S10.|
ht|q|at|^bDeal 4: You cannot afford to hold up, because of the vulnerable position of the @HK. Win the opening lead,| 
ht|r|at|^bEnter your hand with a club and run the @SJ towards East. When the Jack wins, continue with the 10.|
ht|t|at|^bDeal 5: East is the dangerous hand because of the vulnerable position of the @HK. Win the opening lead with| 
ht|u|at|^bthe @SK and finesse the @C10, into West, the safe hand.|
ht|w|at|^bDeal 6: Hold up twice to clarify the club position. Since West is the dangerous hand, the safer option is to run the|
ht|x|at|^b@HJ. If it loses, the suit is established, and you have nine tricks. If the heart finesse wins, return to hand with a high|
ht|y|at|^bspade and cash the @HA. If the @HQ has appeared, you get an overtrick. If West proves to hold @HQxxx, cash your|
ht|z|at|^bother top spade and hope the Queen drops.|

ht|i|at|^bDeal 8: Because of the vulnerability of your spade stopper, it is right to win the @SA. Then cross to dummy with|
