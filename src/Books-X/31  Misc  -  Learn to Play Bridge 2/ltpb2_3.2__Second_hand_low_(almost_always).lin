^-{ Second hand low (unless you should play high) }
^-|fp||cp||at|
If you had heard of third hand high before you started using the program, then you have probably heard of another guideline that is the subject of this topic:
|pg||
cs|2|at|^-{ Second hand low! }
^-
|pg||
at|Once again the title of this topic has been qualified, this time with ^*Iunless you should play high^*N. This has been done to remind you that, like third hand high, second hand low should be seen as a guideline as opposed to a rule. The good news is that, although it is difficult to really compare these things, second hand low tends to be a more reliable guideline than third hand high.

|pg||
cs|1|At|^-{ Second hand low means that if you, as a defender, are the second player to play 
  to a trick, then you should follow suit with your lowest card in the suit that was led. }
^-
|pg||

at|In other words, the second player to play to a trick should usually duck if he was dealt an honor card in the suit that was led. One of the main reasons why it is often a good strategy to play second hand low is that your partner will be the fourth player to play to the trick. Perhaps your partner will be able to win the trick himself.
|pg||

va|7|at|
As you will see from some of the examples that follow, playing second hand low has other things going for it. Playing second hand low will often reduce the number of tricks that the declarer is able to win in the suit that was led. Sometimes second hand low will force declarer to guess well in order to play the suit that was led for the maximum number of winners.|pg||
rh||st||ha|y|md|1s2,sa84,sk95|hc|s2|
tb||ls|nc|

nt|^b@2^z@3Consider this example where South leads the @S2 toward the @SK in the dummy. |pg||

lc|s2|pc|s2|hc|sksa|at|The dummy's @SK is going to win a trick regardless of whether or not you play the @SA. As such, you may not think that it matters if you play second hand low or ignore that guideline and go up with your @SA. |pg||
lc|sask|pc|sa|md|0sq3,,,sjt76|hs|sses|at|However, it does matter if the layout of the outstanding spades is something like this. |pg||

ls|nses|at|Your @SA will win the trick, of course, |pg||
ls|sses|pc|ss|pg||
hc|sksq|at|but the declarer will later win 2 spade tricks (with the @SK and @SQ). |pg||

lc|sksq|up|3|hc|s4|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now consider what would happen if instead of playing the @SA, you had properly played second hand low. |pg||
lc|s4|pc|s|hc|sk|at|The @SK would win the first trick, |pg||
lc|sk|pc|sks|pg||
hs|eswsss|at|but there would be no way for the declarer to come to a second spade winner as your @SA would remain poised over the @SQ. |pg||
ls|ssesws|up|3|hc|sakq|at|To summarize, if you play the @SA in this position, South will win tricks with both the @SK and the @SQ, |pg||
lc|sqa|hc|s4|at|but if you correctly play second hand low, the @SK will be the declarer's only spade winner. |pg||

lc|s4|hc|saq|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|Another bridge guideline that is almost as famous as second hand low helps to explain why playing the @SA in this situation would be a mistake:
|pg||
ht|o|cs|4|at|^-{ Aces were made to take Kings and Queens! The @SA is the most powerful spade. Using an
 Ace to take only spot cards is a waste. Wait until you can get something of value for your Ace! }
|pg||

lc|skqa|up|1|
hc|sts2|

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's change the above combination by trading East's @S10 for one of South's small spades. |pg||
md|0st,,,s2|lc|s2t|hc|sj|hs|nsss|at|In the combination that results, South has a 2-way finesse against the @SJ. The declarer can always win 2 spade tricks now, provided that he correctly guesses the position of the @SJ. |pg||

ls|ssns|lc|sj|hc|s3|at|When South leads the @S3 |pg||
lc|s3|pc|s3|hc|sa|at|the play of the @SA by West would spare declarer from having to find the @SJ in order to win 2 tricks in spades. |pg||

lc|sa|hc|s4|

nt|^b@2^z@3If West correctly plays second hand low, |pg||
lc|s4|pc|s4|hc|sk|at|the declarer may win the @SK |pg||
lc|sk|pc|sks|pg||
hs|nsss|hc|sj|at|and finesse East for the @SJ on the second round of the suit. |pg||
ls|nsss|lc|sj|pc|sss|hs|ws|at|On the layout above, South will win 2 spade tricks regardless of whether or not West wins this trick. |pg||

md|0,sj,,s8|hc|sj|ls|ws|at|If West had been dealt the @SJ, however, he would be able to win this trick with that card. |pg||
lc|sj|pc|sj|pg||
hs|wsss|at|West's @SA can then be used to get some real value as it will capture South's @SQ. South will get only 1 spade trick as a result of his misguess of the @SJ. |pg||
ls|ssws|up|6|hc|sj9|

nt|^b@2^z@3When the @SJ is in the West hand, the declarer can win 2 spade tricks despite West's proper second hand low play by guessing to finesse the @S9 on the first round of the suit. The declarer is welcome to make that play, |pg||
lc|s9sj|pc|s9|md|0,s8,,sj|hc|sj|at|but this finesse will fail when East has the @SJ. |pg||
lc|sj|pc|sj|pg||
hc|sqsksa|at|South will still come to a spade winner once the @SA has been driven out, but he will not score a second spade trick.|pg||
up|4|lc|sqsksa|hs|nsss|hc|sj|

nt|^b@2^z@3The bottom line is that South does not know which defender was dealt the @SJ and left to his own devices he will misguess the position of this card about half of the time.|pg||
ls|ssns|lc|sj|hc|sa|at| If West ignores second hand low and grabs his @SA on the first trick, |pg||
ls|nsss|lc|sjsa|pc|ssass|pg||
hc|skqj|lc|sa|at|all of a sudden the position of the @SJ is irrelevant - the declarer will win 2 spade tricks irrespective of the position of that card.|pg||
up|3|lc|skq|hs|nsss|hc|s4|


nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|Here is the lesson to be learned from this combination of cards:
|pg||
ht|j|cs|2|at|^-{ Second hand low sometimes forces the declarer to guess the position of a missing honor. 
 In these situations playing high as second hand will allow the declarer to avoid guessing. }
^-
|pg||
ht|v|at|Even the best declarers will guess wrong some of the time if you give them a chance to do so!|pg||
lc|s4j|ls|ssns|md|1h32,,hkj|
hs|nhsh|

nt|^b@2^z@3For another example of the same principle, put yourself in the declarer's position and imagine that you need to win a trick with the heart combination shown above. When you lead a heart toward the dummy, |pg||
ls|nhsh|pc|h|md|0,h4|pc|h4|at|West follows with a small heart. |pg||
hs|nh|at|Would you play the @HK or the @HJ from the dummy in this position? |pg||

ls|nh|hc|hkhahq|md|0,hat85,,hq976|hs|haq|

nt|^b@2^z@3There is no correct answer to this question. You have a guess to make. The @HK will be the winning play if the @HA is with West and the @HQ is with East. In this case the @HK will win the trick. |pg||
lc|hkhahq|pc|hk|hc|haq|at|If the @HA and @HQ are reversed, however, |pg||
md|0,hq,,ha|lc|hq|at|East will be able to take the @HK with his @HA |pg||
lc|ha|pc|ha|pg||
hc|hjq|at|and West's @HQ will later take care of the dummy's @HJ. You won't score the heart trick you need if this happens. |pg||

up|2|hc|ha|

nt|^b@2^z@3If the @HA and @HQ are distributed as above, playing the @HJ (instead of the @HK) will get you the trick that you need. |pg||
lc|haqj|pc|hj|hc|h976|at|If East ducks his @HA then the @HJ will win the trick |pg||
lc|h976|hc|ha|at|and if East wins his @HA, |pg||
lc|ha|pc|ha|pg||
hc|hk|at|the @HK will win a later trick. |pg||
up|2|hc|haqj|lc|hk|at|Either way, you will win a heart trick only by playing dummy's @HJ if the @HA and @HQ are distributed as above. |pg||
lc|hakqj|hs|nh|

nt|^b@2^z@3As long as West plays second hand low, you will be faced with a guess as to which heart you should play from the dummy. |pg||
hc|haq|ls|nh|hc|hj|at|Depending on the position of the @HA and @HQ, either the @HJ |pg||
lc|hj|hc|hk|md|0,ha,,hq|at|or the @HK could be the winning play. You cannot see the defenders' hands when you are really playing bridge so you have a guess to make.|pg||

up|1|lc|hqk|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now notice what happens if West ignores second hand low and plays the @HA when you lead a heart toward the dummy. |pg||
lc|ha|pc|ha|hc|hj|at|There is no guess to make now. You know exactly which heart to play from the dummy thanks to West's play of the @HA. Play the @HJ |pg||
lc|hj|pc|hjh|pg||
hc|hk|at|and later in the play the dummy's @HK will provide you with the heart trick that you need. |pg||
hs|nh|lc|hk|up|3|hc|ha|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|The moral of this story is that if West shuns second hand low and rises with the @HA it helps the declarer by sparing him a guess. What is good for the declarer is bad for the defenders!
|pg||
ht|p|cs|1|at|^-{When declarer leads toward a King-Jack combination in the dummy and you hold the
  Ace, it is usually best to play second hand low in order to leave declarer with a guess. }
|pg||

up|1|

nt|^b@2^z@3It should be noted that there are situations in which West would do best to take his @HA even though the @HKJ are in the dummy. |pg||
lc|ha|ls|nh|hs|sh|at|For example if this was a trump contract and one of South's small hearts belonged to another player |pg||
md|0,,,h3|at|(leaving South win a singleton heart), |pg||
ls|sh|pc|h|hc|ha|at|West might be better off to take his @HA when he has the chance. |pg||
lc|ha|hc|h4|at|If West plays second hand low instead |pg||
lc|h4|pc|h4|hc|hk|at|and the @HK is played from dummy, |pg||
lc|hk|pc|hkh|pg||
hs|ehwh|at|the defense will never score a heart trick. |pg||

ls|ehwh|hc|ha|up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Trump contracts are often more complex than this simple example illustrates. For one thing, even if West suspects that South started with a singleton heart and takes his @HA, |pg||
lc|ha|pc|hahh|pg||
hs|nh|at|the dummy's @HK will be established as an extra winner. If the declarer has no losers to discard then West did well to take his @HA. |pg||
ls|nh|up|3|hc|h4|at|If South does have losers in other side suits, second hand low will at worst break even. |pg||
lc|h4|at||pc|h4|hs|nh|at|South will be left a guess and there is a good chance that he will guess wrong.|pg||

up|1|ls|nh|hc|h4|

nt|^b@2^z@3When there is a trump suit, many players are afraid to play second hand low when they have an Ace out of fear that they will never get a trick with their Ace. |pg||
lc|h4|pc|h4|hc|hk|at|That is what might happen here if the declarer guesses to play the @HK from dummy. However, it will often be the case that even when an Ace "goes away", the defense will get a trick in another suit instead. These situations are difficult to judge and there are no magic rules that will always provide the right answer.|pg||

up|1|hc|h4|lc|hk|

nt|^b@2^z@3If you are going to play second hand low in this situation you had better do it quickly! If you think for a while and then play low, |pg||
lc|h4|pc|h4|hc|hak|at|the declarer will know that you have the @HA and the winning guess of the @HK will become very easy for him. |pg||
lc|hka|hc|hq|md|0,hq,,ha|up|1|at|The reason is that if you had the @HQ instead of the @HA, you would have had nothing to think about. You would not even consider playing the @HQ and you would play second hand low as soon as it was your turn to play.|pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose you do have the @HQ in this situation. Perhaps you should sit there for 10 seconds or so before playing second hand low. That might convince the declarer that you really had something to think about. He would think you had the @HA and that you were considering whether or not you should win the trick with that card! |pg||
at|That might be a very clever thing to do, but it would be very much against the rules and the spirit of bridge.|pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|1|at|
^-{ In some card games (poker for example), it is acceptable (even admirable) to try to deceive 
 the other players through your mannerisms and tempo at the table. Bridge is not like this! }
^-
|pg||
at|Bridge, like golf, is a game in which honor plays a very important role. The vast majority of bridge players are very honest (especially when it comes to playing the game that they love). Almost all experienced bridge players would be horrified by the thought of playing slowly when you had nothing to think about in an effort to deceive one of the opponents.

Do not take this to mean that it is wrong to spend some time considering the best bid to make or the best card to play. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you really have something to think about (as you often will when you play bridge), take as much time as you need to come up with a bid or a play that you think will work best.

However, if you know exactly what you are going to bid or play, it is against the rules of bridge to take a lot of time, to scratch your head, or to intentionally do anything designed to mislead your opponents into thinking that you have a problem. Bridge is a game for ladies and gentlemen!

If you are a relatively new bridge player, more experienced players will give you some latitude in these situations. Still, it is important that you learn the rules and proprieties of the game early in your bridge career.

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|Sorry about this diversion, but ethics are important in bridge. Defense is important too and here is a reminder of one of the main lessons to be learned from this card combination:|
pg||hc|h4|cs|3|ht|o|at|^-{ If you are going to play second hand low with the intention of forcing declarer to make 
 a guess, there is a better chance that he will guess wrong if you can duck smoothly! }
|pg||


nt|^b@2^z@3^*iSmoothly^*N is the word that bridge players use to describe a play that is made without apparent thought. As you know, bridge can be a very difficult game and it is hard enough to play well without having to worry about playing quickly at the same time! |pg||
hs|nh|hc|ha|at|Here is a tip to help you to play smoothly in this situation: if the dummy has a King-Jack combination and you have the Ace, try to think about whether you will play your Ace or not ^*Ibefore^*N declarer leads that suit!|pg||
ls|nh|lc|h4ha|md|1d3,dkt95,dq62|
hc|d3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is a new card combination. Don't worry about having to duck smoothly in this one because the declarer does not have a guess to make. Take as much time as you need to come up with the right play! South leads the @D3 toward the dummy. |pg||
lc|d3|pc|d3|hc|dk|at|We have seen that second hand low is usually the right play when you hold the Ace in the suit that was led. How about when you hold the King instead? |pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3
There are deals in which it would be right to play the @DK. Later we will consider why the @DK might be the best play for the defense in this situation. |pg||
lc|dk|hc|d5|at|There are also plenty of possible layouts where second hand low will work out well. Let's consider some of these first. |pg||

md|0dj874,,,da|lc|d5|hc|dk|hs|sded|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is one layout where the play of the @DK would be rather embarassing. If you ignore second hand low and play your @DK, |pg||
ls|Edsd|lc|dk|pc|dkd|hc|da|at|your partner will be forced to overtake your winning @DK with his singleton @DA! This is not what the guideline ^*IAces were made to take Kings and Queens^*N is supposed to mean! |pg||
lc|Da|pc|da|pg||
hs|wd|at|Your diamond spots are still strong enough to ensure that you will win another trick in this suit, but the defense will end up with only 2 tricks in diamonds.|pg||

ls|wd|hc|d5|up|3|

nt|^b@2^z@3If West plays second hand low with the @D5, |pg||
lc|d5|pc|d5|hc|dqda|at|the declarer will probably play the @DQ from dummy and East will win his @DA. |pg||
lc|Dqda|pc|Dqda|pg||
hs|wdsd|at|With the @DK109 over the declarer's @DJ, West will be entitled to 3 more tricks in diamonds and the defenders will win 4 diamond tricks in total. |pg||
ls|sdwd|up|3|hc|dk|at|That is a 
2-trick improvement over the 2 tricks that the defense won when West played his @DK instead of following second hand low!|pg||

hs|sded|

nt|^b@2^z@3
It should be admitted that this layout of the unseen South and East cards (which punished the play of the @DK so severely) is not especially likely. |pg||
md|0,,,d74|at|Here is another possible layout in which the play of the @DK would cost the defense (but only 1 trick, not 2). |pg||
ls|sd|ls|ed|lc|dk|pc|dkdd|pg||
hc|daqj|

nt|^b@2^z@3The @DK wins the first trick, but South did not have to use either the @DQ or the @DJ to force out this card. On a later trick he can use the @DQ or @DJ to drive out the @DA and he will be left with the highest remaining diamond. |pg||
up|3|lc|daqj|hs|ndsd|hc|dk|at|South will therefore win 1 trick in diamonds if West goes up with the @DK on the first round of the suit. |pg||

ls|sdnd|lc|dk|hc|d5|

nt|^b@2^z@3If West plays a second hand low @D5 instead of the @DK, the story has a happy ending for the defenders. |pg||
lc|d5|pc|d5|hc|dqa|at|South will play the @DQ from the dummy and East will win the @DA. |pg||
lc|dqa|pc|dqda|pg||
hs|wdsd|at|West is left sitting over South's remaining @DJ doubleton with the @DK and all of the relevant spot cards. There is no way that the declarer is going to come to a diamond trick now - another victory for playing second hand low!|pg||
up|4|ls|sdwd|hs|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3
So far West has been the second hand to play in all of the second hand low combinations that we have considered. |pg||

wt|n|ls|wd|hs|Ed|hc|d2|at|Let's consider this card combination with East being the player in second position. The lead will now be a small diamond from the dummy. |pg||


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|ed|lc|D2|pc|d2|hc|da|at|If East does not believe in second hand low and plays his @DA, he will win the trick, |pg||
lc|da|pc|dadd|pg||
hc|dqjk|at|but South will retain both the @DQ and @DJ. Declarer can use one of the cards to drive out the @DK and later score a trick with his other diamond honor. |pg||
lc|dqjk|up|3|hc|dak|at|East's play of the @DA as second hand is just as fatal to the defense as West's play of the @DK when he was second to play to the first trick. |pg||
lc|dak|hc|d4|

nt|^b@2^z@3If instead East correctly plays second hand low, |pg||
lc|d4|pc|d4|hc|djdk|at|South will try the @DJ, but West will win the trick with his @DK. |pg||
lc|djdk|pc|djdk|pg||
hs|ndedwd|at|In the position that remains, the @DQ is not going to score a trick for the declarer because East still has the @DA sitting over that card and West's strong spot cards in diamonds effectively mean that the @DQ is surrounded. |pg||

ls|ndwded|hc|d8|wt|s|

nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose that South regains the lead at some point and plays his @D8. |pg||
lc|d8|pc|d8|hc|d5|at|If West blindly follows second hand low and plays his @D5, he could be sorry! |pg||
lc|d5|pc|d5|hc|d6|at|South could play the @D6 from the dummy allowing him to win a diamond trick that he is not entitled to. |pg||
lc|d6|pc|d6|hc|d7|at|If East ducks his @DA, South's @D8 will win the trick. |pg||
lc|d7|hc|da|at|If instead East takes his @DA, |pg||
lc|da|pc|da|pg||
hc|dq|at|the dummy's @DQ will win a later trick. Either way, the declarer can score a diamond trick once West plays the @D5 on the second trick.|pg||
lc|dq|up|3|hc|dt9|

nt|^b@2^z@3
It makes a big difference if West forgets about second hand low on the second round of diamonds. Watch what happens if West plays either the @D10 or the @D9. These cards are equals so it does not matter which of these cards West chooses to play. |pg||
lc|dt9|pc|d9|hc|d6d7|

nt|^b@2^z@3If the declarer plays the @D6 from dummy, East will follow with the @D7 and West's @D9 will win the trick. |pg||
lc|d67|pc|dd|pg||
hs|ednd|at|East's @DA will take care of dummy's @DQ and South will not win any diamond tricks. |pg||
ls|nded|up|2|hc|dqda|at|It is no better for the declarer to cover the @D9 with the dummy's @DQ. In this case East will win the @DA |pg||
lc|dqda|pc|dqda|pg||
hs|ndedwd|at|and, as before, the defense will control the third round of diamonds. |pg||

up|3|ls|edndwd|hc|dt9|

nt|^b@2^z@3
Therefore, West's correct play on the second round of diamonds is to cover South's @D8 with either the @D10 or the @D9. If West makes this play (instead of a second hand low @D5), it will be impossible for South to win a diamond trick. |pg||
lc|dt9|hc|d5|

nt|^b@2^z@3
It should be noted that even if West errs and plays second hand low with the @D5, |pg||
lc|d5|pc|d5|hs|wd|hc|d6|at|it is unlikely that the declarer will find the winning play of the @D6 from the dummy. Playing the @D6 works only if West was dealt the @D10 and the @D9 and made the mistake of failing to play one of those cards. |pg||
lc|d6|hc|dq|md|0,da,,d9|

nt|^b@2^z@3Once West follows small to the second round of diamonds, South should play the @DQ (and not the @D6) from the dummy. This play is necessary if West has the @DA in a layout like the one shown above. West has not made a mistake by ducking his @DA in this case - his only chance to stop declarer from winning a trick with the @DQ is to play low on the second trick in the slim hope that the declarer will play the @D6 from the dummy.|pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3To summarize this discussion about mistakes and splitting: West should expect that even if he plays the @D5, South will go wrong and play the @DQ |pg||
lc|dq|hc|d6|at|because the winning play of the @D6 would be playing West to have made a mistake. Just in case the declarer is inclined to play the @D6 for some reason |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|West's splitting of his @D109 was critical for the success of the defense in this example, |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's back up and see what happens if West splits his @CKQ. |pg||
lc|ckq|pc|cq|hc|ca|at|The declarer will win the dummy's @CA, |pg||
lc|ca|pc|ca|md|0,,,c3|pc|c3|pg||

md|0ct6,,,c85|lc|cjck|hs|ecsc|at|If the remaining unseen clubs are as you see above, West's fine play of splitting his @CKQ does not make any difference. |pg||
hc|cjck|ls|ecsc|at|When West takes the @CJ with his @CK, |pg||

hc|ct|at|South's @C10 becomes the highest remaining club and South will win a second club trick after all. |pg||
up|8|lc|Ct|hs|ncsc|hc|ckq|


nt|^b@2^z@3As long as West has both the @CK and the @CQ, South can always come to 2 tricks with the combination above regardless of whether or not West splits his honors. |pg||
ls|nc|lc|ckq|at|Let's change things slightly by giving one of South's small clubs to one of the defenders. |pg||
ls|sc|md|0,,,c4|hc|c6|at|Now, when South leads the @C6 from his doubleton @C10, |pg||
lc|c6|pc|C6|hc|ckq|hc|cj|at|West had better split his @CKQ or the dummy's @CJ will win a trick that the declarer is not entitled to. |pg||
lc|cj|


nt|^b@2^z@3The @CK and @CQ are equals so, in principle, it does not matter which of these cards West plays when he splits his honors. At the same time, it makes good sense for a partnership to agree on whether they will split with the higher card or the lower card in situations like this one. The reason relates to signaling. If you always split with the same card, your partner will be able to draw an inference about the layout of the suit when you play an honor in a situation like this.|pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3Unfortunately there is no strong consensus among bridge experts about whether it is better for signaling purposes to split with the highest or lowest from a group of 2 or more equal cards. |pg||
lc|cq|at|Some experts would advocate playing the @CK in this situation |pg||
lc|ck|hc|cq|at|while others would always split with the @CQ. |pg||
hc|ck|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|B|at|There is no compelling theoretical argument for splitting either high or low. What is important is that you and your partner make an agreement about this and stick with it!

|pg||


nt|^b@2^z@3The reason that this program advises splitting with the lowest of equal cards has more to do with your memory than anything else. You have already learned to play the lowest from a group of equals when you are third to play to a trick and it will be easier for you to remember this if the same principle applies when you are second to play to a trick. You have to remember a lot of things to play bridge well so we might as well make this task a little easier!

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is a related card combination that demonstrates that the concept of splitting sometimes applies when the cards that are being split are not equals. |pg||
lc|cjk|hc|c6|ls|ncsc|at|South leads the @C6 from his hand. |pg||
lc|c6|pc|c6|hc|c2|at|If West applies second hand low and plays the @C2, |pg||

ls|ec|pc|c|pg||
hs|nc|at|The dummy's @CA would represent a second club winner for the declarer.|pg||
ls|nc|up|3|hc|ckj|

nt|^b@2^z@3If West splits his @CKJ of clubs |pg||
lc|ck|at|by playing the @CJ, the declarer's party is over. |pg||
lc|cj|pc|cj|hc|ca|at|South can win the @CA, a trick that he was always getting, |pg||
lc|ca|pc|Cac|pg||

ls|ncsc|lc|ck|hc|cjca|up|3|at|West must split his honors, ignoring second hand low, in order to hold the declarer to the 1 club winner that he was dealt (the @CA). |pg||

lc|Ca|

nt|^b@2^z@3When we were discussing splitting from equals (such as the King-Queen) a decision was made to always split with the lowest card from a group of equals as a way of signaling to our partner. Although the @CJ is the lower of the @CK and @CJ in this example, the reason that it is correct to 
split with that card has nothing to do with signaling. |pg||

lc|cj|hc|ck|

nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose that West had correctly split his club honors, but had done so by playing the @CK instead of the @CJ. |pg||
lc|ck|pc|ck|hc|ca|at|South would gratefully win the trick with dummy's @CA |pg||
lc|ca|pc|cac|pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3In our next example, suppose South starts by leading the @S3. |pg||
lc|s3|pc|s3|hs|ws|at|West has to decide which spade to play. Does this example look familiar? It should because we have already discussed this position from West's point of view. The suit was diamonds then, but of course it makes no difference that we are talking about spades now. |pg||

md|0sj8,,,sa74|hc|sk|ls|ws|hs|sses|

nt|^b@2^z@3
When we first considered West's problem we saw that if West rejects second hand low and plays the @SK, there were several possible layouts (such as the one now shown above) where the defense would lose a trick as a result. |pg||

lc|sk|hc|s5|

nt|^b@2^z@3Up until now, second hand low has been a very reliable rule. In fact, the only examples that we have seen where second hand low should be rejected are those in which it is necessary to split honors in order to prevent the declarer from winning an undeserved trick with a low card. |pg||
ls|sses|hc|saj|at|By trading South's @SJ for East's @SA, we can create another situation in which second hand low is bad for the defense. |pg||
lc|sj|md|0sa,,,sj|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now that South has the @SA, if West plays second hand low, |pg||
lc|sa5|pc|s5|hc|sq|at|the dummy's @SQ will win the first trick. |pg||
lc|sq|pc|sqs|pg||
hc|sa|at|The declarer will win a second trick with his @SA and take 2 spade tricks in total. |pg||

lc|sk|pc|skss|pg||
hc|sqa|at|Both the @SA and @SQ will now win tricks for the declarer and he will wind up winning 2 spade tricks as before. |pg||

up|3|lc|saq|hc|sk5|

nt|^b@2^z@3At first glance it appears that it doesn't matter if West wins the @SK or if he plays second hand low instead. If you take a second glance you should come to the same conclusion - as far as this spade suit is concerned, South will always win 2 tricks regardless of the card that West plays in this position. |pg||
lc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3In order to see why it could be bad for the defense for West to play second hand low in this situation, it is necessary to step outside of the spade suit itself and think about the whole deal in which the spade suit is contained. |pg||
hc|sk|at|Here we cannot see the whole deal, but consider the difference between the plays of the @SK and the @S5. Both plays result in the declarer winning 2 spade 
tricks, but the second hand low play allows South to do this without losing the lead.|pg||

lc|s5|

nt|^b@2^z@3As we have seen, each time the defenders gain the lead they are able to attack the suit of their choice. If West plays the @SK, he will win the trick |pg||
lc|sk|pc|skss|pg||
at|and he may then be able to lead a suit that will be helpful to the defense. |pg||
up|3|hc|s5|at|By playing second hand low instead, |pg||

hs|nh|hc|h4|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is a related position in which the declarer leads a small card toward a suit that is headed by the Queen in the dummy |pg||
lc|h4|ls|nh|pc|h4|hc|hk|at|and the second hand to play has the King in the suit that was led. |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3If West plays the @HK he will win the trick, |pg||
lc|hk|pc|hkhh|pg||

lc|h2|pc|h2|hc|hq|at|If the declarer plays the @HQ, |pg||
lc|hq|pc|hq|hs|eh|at|he will win a second heart trick on the actual layout, |pg||

lc|hj|md|0,hj,,hk|at|then East will win the @HK |pg||
lc|hk|pc|hk|pg||
hc|ha|at|and the @HA will represent the only winner in hearts for the declarer. |pg||

up|2|lc|ha|hc|htjk|

nt|^b@2^z@3With the @HK and @HJ distributed as you see above, the winning play for the declarer is to insert the dummy's @H10 on the first round of the suit. |pg||
lc|hkjt|pc|ht|hc|hk|at|If East ducks his @HK then the @H10 will become a second winner for declarer and if East takes his @HK, |pg||
lc|hk|pc|hk|pg||
hc|hqa|at|South will be able to win 2 heart tricks (with the @HA and @HQ) later in the play. |pg||

up|2|lc|haq|hc|htjk|

nt|^b@2^z@3This is another example of a situation where the declarer faces a guess. The @H10 will be the winning guess if the @HJ is with West and the @HK is with East, |pg||

lc|ht|hc|hq|md|0,hk,,hj|at|but the @HQ will be the winning guess when West has the @HK and East has the @HJ. On this layout of the missing heart honors |pg||
up|1|lc|htqkj|hc|h2|at|West's only chance to hold the declarer to 1 trick is to play second hand low |pg||

lc|hq|at|by playing dummy's @H10. |pg||
lc|hktj|up|1|hc|h2|

nt|^b@2^z@3As with other second hand low situations that we have seen when the declarer faces a guess, West had better have the presence of mind to duck smoothly. If West thinks for, say, 10 seconds before playing second hand low, |pg||
lc|h2|pc|h2|hc|hkq|at|the declarer will know that West was dealt the @HK and he will have no trouble finding the winning play of the @HQ from the dummy. |pg||
lc|hkq|md|0,hj,,hk|hc|hj|at|If West had the @HJ instead of the @HK then he would not have had to think about his play. |pg||

up|2|lc|hj|hs|nhsh|

nt|^b@2^z@3Consider what happens if we switch the North-South hearts |pg||
md|0hqt5,,ha64|wt|n|at|so that the @HA is in the dummy and the @HQ10 is in declarer's hand. |pg||

ls|nhsh|hc|h4|at|Now, when a low heart is led from the dummy, |pg||
lc|h4|pc|h4|hc|hk3|at|East is in the same position as West was when the North-South hearts were reversed. East has to decide whether he should win the @HK or play second hand low. |pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3Unfortunately for the defense, East's decision is harder than West's was. |pg||
lc|hk3|hs|sh|at|The reason is that East cannot see South's heart holding and he does not know that this is a guessing situation for the declarer. When West had to decide what to play as second hand, he was able to see the dummy's hearts and this gave him a fairly clear picture of what rated to be happening in the heart suit. East's decision has to be made largely in the dark.|pg||
hc|h3|lc|sh|

nt|^b@2^z@3On this layout East would do well to play second hand low |pg||

lc|hjkq|hc|hth2|at|It may be the case, however, that it is West who has the @H10 instead of South. Let's give West the @H10 and give South the @H2 instead. |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3So far we have seen 2 main reasons why second hand low can be a good strategy for the defenders to employ. First, by saving Aces and Kings until a time when they can capture high cards, the defenders will usually end up winning more tricks. Second, rejecting second hand low will sometimes allow the declarer to avoid a guess that he would otherwise have to make. This next example illustrates a third reason why second hand low can be good for the defense.|pg||
hs|sdnd|ls|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose that the declarer is playing in a notrump contract and needs 3 tricks from the diamond suit that you see above. He starts by leading a diamond out of his hand. |pg||
ls|sdnd|pc|d|hc|da|at|If West ignores second hand low and takes his @DA, he will win the trick, |pg||
lc|da|pc|dadd|pg||
hs|nd|at|but the dummy's 3 remaining diamonds (the @DK, @DQ, and @DJ) will each win a subsequent trick. The declarer will have established the 3 diamond winners that he needs.|pg||

up|3|hc|da|

nt|^b@2^z@3West, who can see the dummy's powerful diamonds, is in a good position to know what will happen if he takes his @DA. |pg||
lc|da|ls|nd|hc|d8|at|Suppose West tries the effect of second hand low instead. |pg||
lc|d8|pc|d8|hc|dkqj|at|The declarer can play any of dummy's diamond honors and win the trick. |pg|lc|lc|dkqj|pc|djd|pg||
at|Since East is now void in diamonds and since we are going to play some more tricks, |pg||
md|0,,,c234|at|let's give him something to discard!|pg||

hc|dkq|

nt|^b@2^z@3Notice that the declarer cannot afford to continue diamonds by lead the @DK or @DQ from the dummy. |pg||
lc|dkq|pc|dk|hs|ec|at|East's discard will reveal the 4-1 diamond break |pg||
ls|ec|pc|cd|hc|da|at|and West will win the @DA. |pg||
lc|da|pc|Da|pg||
hc|dq|at|The remaining diamond honor in the dummy will win a second trick for the declarer, |pg||
lc|dq|hs|wdndsd|at|but West's remaining @D109 are strong enough to prevent South from winning the third diamond trick that was required for the contract. |pg||

up|4|ls|wdsdnd|hc|dkq|

nt|^b@2^z@3Instead of leading a high diamond from the dummy on the second round (which resulted in only 2 diamond tricks for declarer), |pg||
lc|dkq|wt|s|hs|sd|at|suppose South uses an entry in another suit to return to his hand for another diamond play. |pg||
ls|sd|pc|d|hc|dadq|at|As before, it will be game over for the defenders for West to rise with the @DA (doing so would establish both the @DK and the @DQ in the dummy as winners). |pg||
lc|dakq|hc|d9|at|West therefore plays second hand low again. |pg||
lc|d9|pc|d9|hc|dkq|at|Dummy wins |pg||
lc|dkq|pc|dq|hs|ec|at|as East discards a club. |pg||
ls|ec|pc|c|pg||
hs|ndwd|

nt|^b@2^z@3Once the 4-1 diamond break is revealed, the declarer will know that leading the third round of diamonds from the dummy would be futile. |pg||
ls|ndwd|hs|sd|wt|s|at|He will have to use a second entry in some other suit to return to his hand in order to lead a third round of diamonds from there. |pg||
ls|sd|pc|d|hs|wd|hc|dk|at|Whether or not West takes his @DA now, the @DK in dummy will eventually score the third diamond trick that the declarer is looking for. |pg||

up|9|hs|sdnd|lc|dk|


nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer can come to the 3 diamond winners that he needs on this layout, regardless of how many times West chooses to play second hand low. There is just one catch. By repeatedly playing second hand low, West can force the declarer to lead diamonds 3 times from his hand in order to establish 3 diamond winners. In a full deal, South would require 3 entries to his hand to lead diamonds 3 times toward the dummy and entries can be a precious commodity! |pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|Here is the key lesson point of this example:

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is simpler example of the same principle. Suppose that you are sitting West. The sight of the @CAQJ10 in the dummy sitting over your @CK should fill you with dread. Your @CK is the 2nd highest club in the deck, but you can see that the club finesse is going to work for the declarer. It looks like there is no way that your @CK could ever win a trick. |pg||

ls|wcnc|

nt|^b@2^z@3So when South leads a club out of his hand, |pg||
ls|sc|pc|c|hc|ck|at|do you simply give up and play your @CK? |pg||
lc|ck|hc|c7|at|Of course not - you would play a low club in this position even if you had never heard of second hand low! |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3Second hand low has proven itself a useful guideline in most of the examples that we have seen so far. However, it is still only a guideline and there are plenty of situations in bridge where the defenders will be better served by rejecting second hand low.

nt|^b@2^z@3It should be clear to you that this is not a good time for second hand low. If you duck your @SA then the singleton @SK in the dummy will win the trick and the @SA, a sure winner for the defense will go away. |pg||

hc|sa|hs|Ss|at|With the entire spade suit in view, it is easy for us to see that East should play his @SA in order to prevent South's singleton @SK from winning an undeserved trick. |pg||
lc|sa|hc|s3|at|Unfortunately this is not such an easy problem from East's point of view. East cannot see South's hand and for all he knows playing second hand low could be best for the defense.|pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is your first chance to consider second hand low in the context of a full deal. North, the dealer, opened 1@S and raised South's 1NT response to 3NT. |pg||
pc|hj|hs|nh|at|Your partner, West, selected the @HJ as his opening lead. After winning the first trick in the dummy, |pg||
ls|nh|pc|hhh|pg||
hc|s3|at|the declarer led the @S3 toward his hand. |pg||
lc|s3|pc|s3|hc|sk|at|You have to decide if you should win your @SK |pg||
lc|sk|hc|s7|at|or play second hand low instead. What are your thoughts on this matter?|pg||

hc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3In deciding between playing the @SK and playing second hand low, a good question you should ask yourself is: "Who has the @SQ?". There is no way to know the answer to that question, |pg||
sk||lc|s7|hc|sq|md|0cjs2,sqc2|at|but if your partner has the @SQ, you certainly do not want to play your @SK on this trick. |pg||
lc|sksq|pc|skss|pg||
hc|sqsaj|at|On this layout, for example, your partner's @SQ will fall under dummy's @SA on the second round of spades and the dummy's @SJ will become a certain winner for declarer. |pg||

lc|sqaj|up|3|hc|s7|

nt|^b@2^z@3
Meanwhile, if you play second hand low in spades (instead of the @SK), your @S7 will win the trick |pg||
lc|s7|pc|sss|pg||
hs|nsesws|at|and the defense will still have the spade suit well under control. |pg||

ls|eswsns|up|3|hc|s7q|at|So if your partner has the @SQ, playing second hand low looks like it will be good for the defense. |pg||
md|0sqc2,cjs2|lc|s7|hc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now suppose that it is the declarer who has the missing @SQ. If you play the @SK you will win the trick, |pg||
lc|skq|pc|skss|pg||
hc|sqaj|at|but the declarer will retain the @SA and @SJ in the dummy and the @SQ in his hand. |pg||
hs|es|at|In other words, declarer now has the 3 highest outstanding spades between the North-South hands. These cards will take care of your 3 remaining spades so South will be able to run the rest of the suit without losing another trick. |pg||
lc|saj|ls|es|up|3|hc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3So playing the @SK does not seem to work very well regardless of who holds the missing @SQ. |pg||
lc|skq|hc|s7|at|Let's try the effect of second hand low. |pg||
lc|s7|pc|s7|hc|sq|at|South wins the @SQ |pg||
lc|sq|pc|sqs|pg||
hs|nsss|at|and continues with a spade to the dummy's @SA. |pg||
ls|nsss|pc|sssas|pg||
hs|esns|at|You can already see that ducking your @SK has worked out well. You have the @SK10 over the dummy's @SJ9. You will therefore win 2 spade tricks instead of the 1 spade winner you had when you went up with your @SK as second hand.|pg||
ls|nses|hc|sj|

nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer continues by leading the @SJ from the dummy. |pg||
lc|sj|pc|sj|hc|st|at|Hopefully you can see that this would be a very bad time to play second hand low! |pg||
lc|st|hc|sk|at|The time has come to take your @SK. |pg||
lc|sk|pc|skdd|pg||
hs|esns|at|You have won the spade battle thanks to second hand low, but the war is not over yet. |pg||
ls|ns|hs|ehedec|at|Can you figure out the best card to lead now? This is not an easy problem so feel free to look at the South and West hands when you try to figure it out!|pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3In fact, there is only 1 of your 9 remaining cards that you can lead now that will result in the defeat of South's 3NT contract. |pg||
ls|eheseced|hc|hq|at|That card is the @HQ and you should not be upset with yourself if it did not occur to you to play that card now. |pg||
lc|hq|hc|h5|hs|Nh|at|At first glance it appears that, if a heart lead is right, the @H5 has a lot going for it. You can see that the dummy will have to win the next round of hearts with the singleton @HA. Why waste the @HQ when you can play the @H5?|pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3You are about to see why. If you play the @H5, the singleton @HA in the dummy wins the trick. |pg||
lc|h5|ls|nh|pc|hhhh|pg||
hs|nses|at|Declarer continues with a spade to your @S10 |pg||
ls|nses|pc|sscc|pg||
hs|ns|at|in order to establish the dummy's last spade as a winner. |pg||
ls|ns|hs|ehwh|at|Take a careful look at the remaining East-West hearts. The suit is blocked. |pg||
ls|wh|at|You can cash your carefully preserved @HQ now, |pg||
ls|eh|pc|hhhc|pg||

ls|wh|hs|wcwd|at|and West has no entry in either diamonds or clubs with which he could regain the lead. |pg||

ls|wdwc|hs|ndscedec|

nt|^b@2^z@3
South will be able to win whatever suit you return now |pg||
ls|edecscnd|hc|cakdaks9|at|and win the next 5 tricks (the @CA and @CK in his hand and the @DA, @DK, and @S9 in the dummy). |pg||
mc|9|at|Since the declarer has won 4 tricks already, he will make his 3NT contract.|pg||
ls|wdwc|lc|cakdaks9|up|12|
hc|hq|

nt|^b@2^z@3If you figured out to unblock the @HQ as East (instead of returning the @H5) then you fully deserve the reward that you will receive - the defeat of the contract! |pg||

lc|hq|pc|hq|hs|nh|at|The declarer will win this trick in the dummy |pg||
ls|nh|pc|hhh|pg||
hs|esns|at|and play a spade to your @S10 as before. |pg||
ls|nses|pc|sscc|pg||
hs|ehwh|at|With your @HQ out of the way, the heart suit is unblocked and you can lead your @H5 to allow your partner to win the trick. |pg||
ls|ehwh|pc|hhh9c|pg||
hs|wh|mc|8|at|The defense has won 3 tricks and West still has 2 heart winners to cash. South's 3NT will fail by 1 trick.|pg||
up|12|ls|wh|hc|hq|

nt|^b@2^z@3Hopefully you can appreciate how well East's return of the @HQ works out (versus leading the @H5), |pg||
sk|e|at|but is it really possible for East to find this play with only his own hand and the dummy in view? |pg||
sk||hs|wh|at|The reason that the @HQ was such an effective lead was due to the fact that West had the @H10 and @H9, but how can East know that? |pg||

lc|hq|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|d|cs|2|at|^-{ West's opening lead was the @HJ. According to standard leads, West 
 would not lead the @HJ unless he had the @H10 and the @H9 to back it up! }
^-
|pg||
ht|q|at|Actually West would also lead the @HJ from a doubleton or from a 3-card holding headed by the @HJ10, but East can expect his partner to lead his longest suit given the bidding. |pg||

hs|eh|ls|wh|

nt|^b@2^z@3Recall that the standard lead from a doubleton |pg||
ls|eh|hc|hq|at|is the higher card and that this principle should normally be applied by the defense on all tricks, not just on the opening lead. |pg||
hs|nh|at|However, when a defender can see that he will be throwing a winner away if he leads high from a doubleton, he needs a very good reason to do this. Winning tricks takes priority over signaling! |pg||
lc|hq|hc|h5|at|Given dummy's heart holding, it would often be correct for East to lead back the @H5 in this situation.|pg||
lc|h5|hc|hq|

nt|^b@2^z@3On this deal, however, you can be certain that it is safe to unblock the @HQ at the critical point of the play, even though you will be throwing away a sure winner by doing so. |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3In our next example deal, South, the dealer, opened 1NT and showed a 4-card heart suit after North's Stayman 2@C inquiry. North jumped all the way to 6@H which became the final contract. |pg||
hs|wdwswcwh|at|Before we go through the play of this deal, think about the card that you would select as your opening lead from the West hand. |pg||

ls|whwswdwc|hc|st|

nt|^b@2^z@3Hopefully you looked no further than your @S10 for your opening lead. |pg||
lc|st|hc|da|at|It could be right to lead your @DA here. Perhaps your partner has a singleton diamond and he will be able to score a ruff on the second round of the suit.

ls|wc|

nt|^b@2^z@3As you have learned, when leading from a suit that is headed by a sequence, |pg||
ls|ws|hc|st|at|the highest card in that suit is the standard lead. |pg||
hc|s9|at|Since this is a trump contract, the suit you lead has to be headed by only 2 cards before the standard lead is the highest card. |pg||
lc|st9|hc|s4|at|If this was a notrump contract, you would need a 3rd card (the @S8) in the sequence before favoring the lead of the @S10 over the @S4 (your 4th best spade).|pg||

lc|S4|hc|st|

nt|^b@2^z@3
The @S10 comes with no guarantees, of course, but let's give this lead a try. |pg||
lc|st|pc|st|at|Here is a good habit to get into on defense: when the dummy comes down, count the number of high card points that it contains. |pg||
hc|sakqdkjca|at|This particular dummy has a lot of high card points - 17 to be exact. |pg||
lc|sakqdkjca|hc|da|

nt|^b@2^z@3You have 4 high card points yourself and, since there are 40 high card points in the deck, there are 19 left for your partner and the declarer. |pg||

lc|da|at|South's 1NT showed between 15 and 17 of the 19 missing high card points |pg||

ls|wh|pc|h|at|At this point you cannot help but notice the smile that has come across the declarer's face. It's nice to know that at least one of the other players at this table is having a good time playing bridge!|pg||

ls|nc|pc|ccac|pg||

lc|d2|pc|d2|pg||
at|All of a sudden the declarer is not smiling anymore! |pg||


nt|^b@2^z@3The fact that South has lost his smile has got to be a good sign since whatever is bad for the declarer is good for the defenders! South gives considerable thought to his next play. This is a good time for you to do some thinking as well. Do you foresee any decisions that you might have to make? |pg||
hs|ndwd|at|Does the diamond position seem familiar to you? |pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3The diamond position should ring a bell because you have learned that when the dummy has a King-Jack combination and you, as the opening leader, have the Ace in that suit, it is usually a good idea to play second hand low in that suit. Furthermore, you should try to duck your Ace smoothly to make it as difficult as possible for the declarer to guess that suit if he is missing the Queen as well. |pg||

ls|wdnd|hs|nh|

nt|^b@2^z@3Before you have to make a decision in the diamond suit, think about what has happened in the trump suit. |pg||
sk||ls|nh|hc|hk|at|It appears that your partner has the @HK. |pg||
up|12|hs|nhsh|at|Declarer finessed the @HQ at trick 2. |pg||
ls|nhsh|lc|hk|pc|hhhq|hs|wh|at|When that finesse won it made the declarer smile, |pg||

ls|wd|pc|d|pg||
hs|eh|at|the 4-1 trump break was revealed. This appeared to be a cause of concern for the declarer. |pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3All indications suggest that your partner has the @HK and another smaller heart left (if your partner was down to a singleton @HK then the declarer would draw his last trump). |pg||
ls|eh|hc|hkdq|at|If your partner has the @HK, then South must have the @DQ. How can you know that? |pg||
at|You know that the declarer has the @DQ because your early computations suggested that your partner has 4 high card points at the most. If East had both the @HK and the @DQ he would have 5 high card points.|pg||

lc|hk|

nt|^b@2^z@3
Since South must have the @DQ, |pg||
lc|dq|hs|ndsdwd|at|he has no guess in that suit and there is no point in playing second hand low when the time comes. |pg||
ls|ndsdwd|hs|ss|at|The time is coming soon, because South is now ready to play! He cashes the @SJ |pg||
ls|ss|pc|ssss|pg||
hs|ndsd|at|and leads a small diamond toward the dummy. |pg||
ls|ndsd|pc|d|hc|d9|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now suppose that you had not done so much good thinking. You might well play second hand low in diamonds in the hope that your partner was dealt the @DQ and that South might misguess the suit. |pg||
lc|d9|pc|d9|hs|nd|at|If you made that mistake then you would be sorry. South would win the trick in dummy |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3|pc|sk|hs|eh|at|East can ruff dummy's last spade, |pg||

up|19|

nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer played this hand well, but as we have seen, you really knew enough information about the deal to reject second hand low and take your @DA at the critical point of the play. |pg||
lc|da|pc|dadd|pg||
hs|ehnhsh|at|With 1 trick in the bag and with the 2 of the 3 highest remaining trumps in your partner's hand, even if South was a magician he could not make 6@H from here! |pg||
ls|nhsheh|up|3|hc|da|

nt|^b@2^z@3Before we go any further, you should be advised that this is another very challenging deal. Perhaps you would not be ready yet to find the winning @DA play (instead of second hand low) as West. What is more important right now is that you understand the logic behind why the @DA is the correct play. If the reasoning behind this play makes sense to you, it is only a matter of time and practice before you can defend this well at the table!|pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3A key element of the thinking process that allows you to find the play of the @DA |pg||
lc|da|hc|hk|at|is the inference that your partner was dealt the @HK. |pg||
up|17|hs|nhsh|at|The roundabout way in which the declarer played the trump suit (and his mannerisms while he was doing so) made it a near certainty that the @HK was dealt to East. If South had the @HK (in addition to the @HAQJ) he simply would have drawn trump by leading out his high hearts.|pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3It turned out that your partner's @H10 was a critical card as well, but the fact of the matter is that you needed your partner to hold that card for there to be a chance to defeat the contract. |pg||
hc|h3|at|If South had the @H10 instead of the @H3, |pg||
md|0ht,,,h3|lc|h3t|hs|sheh|at|he would retain a finessing position over East's @HK and the defense would not be entitled to win a trump trick. |pg||

nt|^b@2^z@3Regardless of the position of the @H10, |pg||
lc|ht|hc|d9|hs|nd|at|it could not help you to play second hand low when South led a diamond toward the dummy. |pg||
hc|hk|ls|nd|lc|d9|at|Once you figured out that East was dealt the @HK, |pg||
lc|hk|hc|dq|at|South was then known to hold the @DQ. |pg||
hs|nd|hc|d9|at|The usual reason for playing second hand low in this position (to leave declarer with a guess in diamonds) was no longer valid - there could be no guess in diamonds for the declarer given that he held the @DQ. |pg||

lc|d9dq|ls|nd|up|21|hc|hkdq|

nt|^b@2^z@3
We did a little arithmetic early on that showed that East could not hold both the @HK and the @DQ. There is another way to come to this conclusion and all 13 of South's original cards have been restored for this purpose. |pg||

lc|Dq|

nt|^b@2^z@3Let East keep his @HK, |pg||
lc|hk|hc|d3dq|at|but give him South's @DQ in exchange for one of East's small diamonds. |pg||

There are a number of reasons why the deal that you just witnessed is an important one in our quest to learn to become good defenders. The key lesson points of this deal will be presented on the next several pages.

The next topic will contain a whole new class of positions where second hand low does not apply. So don't go memorizing this definition just yet - you will be presented with a more accurate definition of second hand low before too long!

nt|^b@2^z@3
We have seen 3 ways that second hand low can help the defenders to win more tricks:
|pg||

cs|3|at|^-{ 1. Aces were made to take Kings and Queens! If declarer leads a low card and you reject
second hand low by winning your Ace or King, you won't get much value in return! }
^-
|pg||
at|In other words, it is usually best to save your Aces and Kings until they can be used to capture some of the opponents' high cards.
|pg||
cs|2|at|^-{ 2. Second hand low sometimes forces the declarer to guess the position of missing honors.
 In these situations playing high as second hand will allow the declarer to avoid guessing. }
^-
|pg||
at|Even the best bridge players are not supermen. Lacking x-ray vision, they cannot see through the backs of your cards and they will sometimes misguess if you give them a chance to do so!
|pg||
cs|4|at|^-{ 3. In some situations the defenders can use second hand low to force the declarer 
 to use up his entries in order to play a suit for the maximum number of winners. }
^-
|pg||
at|Entries are a valuable commodity on a lot of bridge deals. If a defender can force the declarer to use up several entries in order to play a suit to best advantage, the declarer may not have enough entries to do everything that he would like to do in the other suits.
|pg||
at|There are reasons other than the 3 shown above which further demonstrate why second hand low tends to be a good strategy for the defenders. We will explore some of these reasons later in this program.|pg||


nt|^b@2^z@3
Here is some (mostly obvious) situations where you should not play second hand low:
|pg||
cs|1|at|^-{ Do not play second hand low if you can see an easy way to defeat the contract 
 and if ducking will give the declarer an opportunity to make his contract! }
^-
|pg||
at|Always remember that the primary goal of the defenders is to defeat the declarer's contract. Do not risk allowing the declarer to make his contract in the hope of scoring extra undertricks!
|pg||
cs|3|at|^-{ It is almost never right to play second hand low (especially when there is a trump suit) 
 when you have the Ace of the suit that was led and the dummy has the singleton King. }
^-
|pg||
at|Not only will you get good value if you take your Ace in this situation, you will probably never get a trick with your Ace if you don't take it when you have the chance! There are other holdings in the dummy (such as singleton Queen or the King-Queen doubleton) that suggest rejecting second hand low in favor of taking your Ace.
|pg||
cs|2|at|^-{ Another time to reject second hand low is when you need to split your honors 
 in order to prevent the declarer from winning an easy trick with a low card. }
^-
|pg||
at|For example, if you hold a King-Queen combination, it is usually best to play one of these cards as second hand. Otherwise, the declarer, holding the Ace-Jack, could win the trick with his Jack.
|pg||
cs|4|at|^-{ There is no real standard about which card to play when splitting as second hand, but in 
 this program we will always split with the lowest card as a type of signal for our partners.}
|pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3
Here are some instructive points that we have covered which relate to second hand low and situations where the declarer faces a guess. First, here is an example of one of the most common of these positions:
|pg||
cs|1|at|^-{ When declarer leads toward a King-Jack combination in the dummy and you hold the
 Ace, it is usually best to play second hand low in order to leave declarer with a guess. }
^-
|pg||
at|Sometimes, however, the principle shown above does not apply:
|pg||
cs|3|at|^-{ When declarer leads toward a King-Jack combination and you hold the Ace, playing 
 second hand low is much less attractive if the declarer in known to hold the Queen! }
^-
|pg||
at|The whole point of ducking your Ace in this situation is to force the declarer to guess the position of the Ace and Queen. If the declarer has the Queen, then he has no guessing to do!
|pg||
at|Here is a reminder of how you can help to ensure that the declarer will frequently misguess when you play second hand low:
|pg||
cs|2|at|^-{ If you are going to play second hand low with the intention of forcing declarer to make 
 a guess, there is a better chance that he will guess wrong if you can duck smoothly! }
^-
|pg||
at|To duck smoothly means to play second hand low without giving the matter a lot of thought. If you take a long time and then play second hand low, the declarer will suspect that you were thinking of winning the trick. That information may help him to make a successful guess!|pg||



nt|^b@2^z@3
While we are discussing the tempo with which cards are played, here are some other lessons on this subject that have been presented:
|pg||
cs|4|at|^-{ Some declarers will offer the defense clues about the unseen cards by varying their tempo 
 or mannerisms during the play of the hand, but these inferences are not always reliable! }
^-
|pg||
at|You have to be careful about drawing inferences from these sorts of actions because different bridge players will react differently (and with different tempo) in the same situations. A play that seems obvious to you (and thus should not take a lot of time) may be far from obvious to another bridge player.
|pg||
at|One of the most important rules of bridge relates to the subject of tempo:
|pg||
cs|1|at|^-{ In some card games (poker for example), it is acceptable (even admirable) to try to deceive 
 the other players through your mannerisms and tempo at the table. Bridge is not like this! }
^-
|pg||
at|Intentionally breaking the rules of the game is cheating.
|pg||
cs|3|at|^-{ There is no place for cheating in bridge. Cheaters are ultimately caught and once this 
 happens, they have a very difficult time finding partners and opponents to play with! }
^-
|pg||

at|Proper ethics and behavior are important to the game of bridge. Bridge players who do not observe the rules of fairness and etiquette ruin the game, not only for themselves, but for their partners and opponents. Bridge is a game of honor that is played by ladies and gentlemen!|pg||


nt|^b@2^z@3
Back to the subject of second hand low:
|pg||
cs|2|at|^-{ Second hand decisions are usually more difficult when they are faced by the partner of the 
 opening leader because the third hand's (declarer) holding in the suit is hidden.  }
^-
|pg||

cs|4|at|For example:
|pg||
at|^-{ When the partner of the opening leader is second to play and holds the Ace in the suit that 
 was led, playing second hand low can be dangerous - declarer might have a singleton King! }
^-
|pg||

cs|1|at|The opening leader also has to be concerned about ducking his Aces:
|pg||
at|^-{ Ducking an Ace against a trump contract can be risky business. Sometimes you will not 
 get a trick with your Ace, even if the declarer does not have a singleton in that suit. }
^-
|pg||
at|On some deals, after the opening leader has ducked an Ace, the declarer will be able to discard whatever losers he has left in a suit on dummy's winners in another suit.
|pg||
cs|3|at|^-{ There are many situations, especially in trump contracts, where the defenders are faced 
 with a choice between winning an early trick in one suit or winning a later trick in another suit. }
^-
|pg||
at|When the declarer leads a singleton toward a King in the dummy, if the opening leader takes his Ace, the King can later be used to discard one of declarer's losers in another suit. It may not matter if second hand plays the Ace or low in these situations.|pg||


nt|^b@2^z@3
We have seen (and we will continue to see) a lot of card combinations in this program. Here's why:
|pg||
cs|2|at|^-{ Studying card combinations outside of the context of an entire deal is useful because 
 it allows us to focus on a particular suit without being distracted by the other 3 suits. }
^-
|pg||
cs|4|at|^-{ Keep in mind, however, that the correct play in a given card combination 
 can vary as a function of what is happening in the rest of the deal. }
^-
|pg||

cs|1|at|Finally, some instructive tips have been presented in this topic that relate to defense in general:
|pg||
at|^-{ Count the dummy's high card points and add that to your own high card points. Then 
 subtract the total from 40 to learn how many high card points there are in the unseen hands. }
^-
|pg||
cs|3|at|^-{ Being able to count the high card points and distribution of the unseen hands will prove 
 useful to the defenders. The math itself is easy, but it takes a little practice to get good at this! }
^-
|pg||
cs|2|at|^-{ A defender can often draw inferences about the unseen hands by considering the way 
 in which the declarer is playing (or by considering plays that the declarer did ^*Inot^*N make). } 
^-
|pg||
cs|4|at|^-{ Don't make a play that will succeed only if one of the opponents has made a mistake! }
^-
|pg||
at|About the last point, it is the case that all bridge players make plenty of mistakes, but it is very difficult to judge when one of your opponents has erred. You will do better if you assume that your opponents have some good reason for the plays that they make!
