^-|fp||cp||at|
Have you fallen in love with Jacoby transfer bids yet? Perhaps "love" is too strong a feeling to have for any convention, but hopefully you have been impressed by the effectiveness and versatility of Jacoby transfers. Jacoby is one of the most popular conventions ever devised and there is a sound reason for this - these bids really work!

Assuming that you like using Jacoby transfers over 1NT openings, the following will be good news for you:

|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ In SAYC Jacoby transfer bids are used over 2NT openings as well! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|2@D and 2@H are Jacoby transfers after a 1NT opening, but obviously the same bids cannot be used (because they are not legal) when the opening bid is 2NT.

|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ 3@D and 3@H are Jacoby transfers after a 2NT opening bid. }

|va|5|At|^D{|cs|1|ia|o2n!3d|at|} ^O{|cs|1|ia|o2n!3h|at|}

|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|You worked hard to learn the mechanics of Jacoby transfers after a 1NT opening bid. You will be happy to learn that most of what you learned can also be applied to Jacoby transfers after a 2NT opening. Learning to use Jacoby over a 2NT opening is not going to be difficult for you.

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


tb||

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|In particular, the following aspects of Jacoby transfers after a 2NT opening are directly analogous to aspects of transfers that we have studied when the opening bid was 1NT.

^D{|cs|1|ia|o2n!3d|at| } ^O{|cs|1|ia|o2n!3h|at| }

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ The 3@D transfer promises 5 or more hearts (as did the 2@D transfer over 1NT). }
^-

cs|2|at|^-{ The 3@H transfer promises 5 or more spades (as did the 2@H transfer over 1NT). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ When a Jacoby transfer is used after a 2NT opening, the opener almost always
 completes the transfer by bidding 3 of the major suit that the responder has shown. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ If the opener has a maximum hand with 4-card support for the responder's major,
 he can super-accept the transfer by jumping (in this case to 4 of his partner's major). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ If the responder has 5-4 or 5-5 in the majors and not enough strength to force to game, 
 he should transfer to his longest and strongest major and then pass at his next turn. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The responder should almost always use Jacoby when he has a 5-card major. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|As with a 1NT opening bid, the responder to a 2NT opening should use Stayman (and not Jacoby) when he has 5-4 in the majors and game interest. With all other hands that contain a 5-card (or longer) major suit, the responder to a 2NT opening should use a Jacoby transfer.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The most difficult part about learning Jacoby transfer bids after a 1NT opening involved becoming familiar with all of the responder's options after the opener completes the transfer. Hopefully you noticed that the meanings of all of the responder's rebids after a Jacoby transfer are pretty much what you would expect them to be.

For example, notrump rebids always left open the possibility of playing in notrump and rebids in the responder's major always suggested extra length in that suit (that is, at least a 6-card suit). The definitions of various rebids after a Jacoby transfer in SAYC were designed to be as natural and easy to remember as possible.

|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|The same is true of the responder's rebids after he makes a Jacoby transfer over 2NT and the opener completes the transfer. The responder has fewer options now than he had after a 1NT opening (because 2NT starts the bidding 1 level higher^*N), but SAYC defines his rebids in a very sensible way.

^D{|cs|1|ia|o2n3d3h?|at|} ^O{|cs|1|ia|o2n3h3s?|at|}

|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|Not only are the responder's rebids defined in a sensible way in the bidding sequences shown above, his rebidding options are (for the most part) analogous in nature to the options he has after a 1NT opener followed by a Jacoby transfer.
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Here are some examples of the responder's rebids after he invokes a Jacoby transfer over a 2NT opening and the opening bidder completes the transfer:

|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


cs|3|ht|e|at|^D{ |ih|psqt872h7d876c9542|at| }
|cs|1|ht|f|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3h3s?|at| }


|hc|sq|at|This hand has only 2 HCP. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


lc|sq|hs|ss|At|Add 1 long suit point for the 5-card spade suit to get 3 total points. That is not enough to force to game even opposite a monstrous 20-21 HCP 2NT opening bid. There is a good chance, however, that 3@S will be a better contract than 2NT. This hand will certainly take a few tricks if spades are trump, but it may turn out to be completely worthless in a notrump contract. The responder should try to sign off in 3@S when he holds a hand like this.

|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|It should come as no surprise to you that the responder can accomplish this goal by starting with a 3@H bid as a Jacoby transfer to 3@S and passing when the opener completes the transfer. Not only will the desired contract be reached, but the strong hand (the 2NT opening bidder) will end up as the declarer.

|cs|1|ht|f|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3h3s!p|at| }

|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ht|x|cs|2|at|^-{ To sign off in 3 of a major, the responder to a 2NT opening should transfer to his 
 5-card (or longer) major suit and pass when the opener completes the transfer. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|ss|cs|3|ht|b|at|^D{ |ih|ps85hkj974dq63ct42|at| }
|cs|1|ht|c|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3d3h?|at| }

|hc|hkjdq|at|This hand is sufficiently strong that the responder should insist on some game contract facing a 20-21 HCP 2NT opening. With 6 HCP |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


lc|hkjdq|hs|sh|at|and 1 long suit point for the 5-card heart suit, this hand has 7 total points - more than enough to suggest that either 3NT or 4@H should be a good contract. The problem is that the responder does not know which of these game contracts rates to be better.

|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|The opening bidder should be the one to make this decision which he can do based on the number of hearts in his hand. If the opener has a doubleton heart, then 3NT is probably the best place to play. If he has 3 or more hearts, at least an 8-card major suit fit will be present and then 4@H will likely be the contract of choice.

|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|The responder can ask the opener for help by rebidding 3NT after the opener completes the transfer. This bidding sequence promises exactly 5 hearts and asks the opener to either pass (if he has a doubleton heart) or to bid 4@H. In either case there is a very good chance that the best contract will be reached.

|cs|1|ht|c|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3d3h!3n|at| }
|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


cs|2|ht|y|at|^-{ After a 2NT opening and a Jacoby transfer, the responder's 3NT rebid asks the opener 
 to choose between 3NT and 4 of the responder's major (based on his trump support).  }
^-
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|sh|cs|3|ht|b|at|^D{ |ih|psaj963hkj4dqt2c85|at| }
|cs|1|ht|c|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3h3s?|at| }

|hc|hcsajhkjdq|at|This time the responder has 11 HCP. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


lc|sajhkjdq|hs|ss|at|Add a long suit point for the 5-card spade suit and this hand is worth 12 total points. That's enough so that a small slam will usually be a reasonable proposition if the opener is at the top end of the 20-21 HCP range that he promised with his 2NT opening bid. The responder has no way of knowing if the partnership belongs in slam or not and whether or not spades should be trump.

|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|After he starts with 3@H and the opener completes the transfer, 4NT is the correct rebid for the responder. Recall that after a 1NT opening bid and Jacoby transfer, a 4NT rebid by the responder is not the Blackwood convention. 4NT is a quantitative slam try, promising exactly 5 cards in the responder's major suit. The same principle applies after a 2NT opening bid.

|cs|1|ht|c|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3h3s!4n|at| }
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ht|t|at|The opener will now place the final contract. If he has a minimum hand, he will either pass 4NT or bid 5@S (depending on his degree of spade support). If the opener is maximum he will bid 6NT with a doubleton spade and 6@S if he has at least 3-card spade support.

|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer bid followed by a 4NT rebid is not Blackwood - it is a quantitative try 
 for slam that is based on a balanced hand with exactly 5 cards in the major that was shown. }

|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|ss|cs|3|ht|b|at|^D{ |ih|ps7hqt76432dt5cj64|at| }
|cs|1|ht|c|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3d3h?|at| }

|hc|cjhq|at|The responder has only 3 HCP, |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


lc|hqcj|hs|sh|At|but the 7-card heart suit is worth 3 long suit points. With 6 total points facing a 20-21 HCP 2NT opening bid, the responder should insist upon playing in a game contract. Given that there is sure to be at least a 9-card fit in hearts, it would be a mistake for the responder to consider any final contract other than 4@H when he holds this hand.

|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|The responder can express his interest in playing in 4@H by transferring to 3@H and then rebidding 4@H when the opener completes the transfer. This bidding sequence is a signoff in the SAYC bidding system. The opener should pass no matter how much he likes his hand - he has already told his partner how many points he was dealt and the responder has selected a final contract based on that information.
|cs|1|ht|c|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3d3h!4h|at| }

|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ht|t|at|This bidding sequence, like others that we have seen, is directly analogous to one that we encountered when we were studying Jacoby transfers after a 1NT opening bid. Regardless of whether the opening bid is 1NT or 2NT, if the responder wants to sign off in 4 of a major, he starts with a Jacoby transfer and then rebids 4 of his long major.

|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ To sign off in 4 of a long major after a 2NT opening bid, transfer to your 
 major and then rebid 4 of your major (which your partner will pass). }

|hc|sahajcqj|at|This hand has 12 HCP |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


lc|csahajcqj|hs|ss|At|and 1 long suit point for the 5-card spade suit. With 13 total points, the responder can be fairly certain that the partnership belongs in some small slam contract. What is not clear is which small slam rates to be best. 6@S will often be right if the opener has at least 3-card spade support. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|sc|at|Otherwise, the partnership may belong in either 6@C or 6NT.

|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|It should come as no surprise to you that the correct rebid with this hand is 4@C. After a 1NT opening bid and a Jacoby transfer, a new suit bid by the responder promises at least 4 cards in that suit. The same is true after a 2NT opening. 4@C lets the opener know that the responder has length in clubs and that the partnership might belong in a contract with clubs as trump.

|cs|1|ht|c|at|^O{ |ia|o2n3h3s!4c|at| }
|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ht|s|at|There is one difference between this bidding sequence and its analogous sequence after a 1NT opening. With 1 exception, the rebid of a new suit after a Jacoby transfer commits the partnership to game after a 1NT opening, but the responder does not need slam interest to use such a sequence. After a 2NT opening, however, such a new suit rebid by the responder suggests that a slam^*B ^*Bcontract may be possible.

|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer followed by the bid of a new suit describes a hand with at least a 5 cards
 in the major, at least 4 cards in the new suit, and at least mild interest in a slam contract. }

|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|sc|

nt|^b@2^z@3
Recall that after a 1NT opening bid, the responder has 2 ways to describe a hand with at least 5-5 in the majors:

^D{|cs|1|ia|o1n2d2h2s|at| } ^O{|cs|1|ia|o1n2h2s3h|at| }

|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|In the first bidding sequence shown above, the responder transfers to 2@H and rebids 2@S to describe an invitational hand with at least 5-5 in the majors. By showing his majors in the reverse order (as in the second bidding sequence shown above), the responder is able to describe a hand that is strong enough to force to game (and may have slam interest) with the same distribution.

|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|^D{|cs|1|ia|o2n3d3h3s|at| } ^O{|cs|1|ia|o2n3h3s4h|at| }

After a 2NT opening bid, the responder also has 2 ways of describing hands with at least 5-5 in the majors. As before, he can transfer to 1 major and then rebid the other major after his partner completes the transfer. Both of these bidding sequences promise at least 5-5 in the majors in SAYC.
|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The strength of the hands described by transferring to 1 major and then rebidding in the other major are different after a 2NT opening than after a 1NT opening. Neither of these bidding sequences shown below is used for game invitational hands.

In general, there are no bidding sequences that are used to invite game after a 2NT opening bid. As a practical matter, there is simply not enough bidding space between 2NT and the game level to allow for invitational bidding sequences. If the responder is unsure as to whether the partnership will have the values for game or not, he just has to take his best guess.

^D{|cs|1|ia|o2n3d3h3s|at| } ^O{|cs|1|ia|o2n3h3s4h|at| }

|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|In SAYC the first bidding sequence shown above suggests a hand with at least 5-5 in the majors and at least some interest in slam. The second bidding sequence is used to describe a hand with at least 5-5 in the majors that is only interested in finding the best game contract. When the responder uses the second bidding sequence, he expects his partner to either pass 4@H or to bid 4@S (which he will pass).

|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Transfer to hearts and rebid 3@S with slam interest and at least 5-5 in the majors.  
 Transfer to spades and rebid 4@H with at least 5-5 in the majors and no interest in slam. }

pg| ***** 51 ***** |


lc|skjhajdq|hc|skj873haj954|at|It is very likely that the partnership belongs in either 6@H or 6@S and the responder should use the first bidding sequence shown above to alert the opener that at least a small slam might be there. The opener will sign off in 4@H or 4@S (depending on which major he prefers) if he does not like his hand for slam. If the opener chooses to cooperate he can cuebid either 4@C or 4@D (to suggest the Ace of that suit).

|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


lc|skj873haj954|hc|sacj|at|The second hand has only 5 HCP and 7 total points - not enough to think about a slam. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hc|s9542ht7632|lc|cj|at|All the responder cares about here is finding the best game contract so he uses the second bidding sequence. The opener will either pass 4@H or return to 4@S (which the responder would pass) depending on which major he prefers.

lc|sa9542ht7632|


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|We learned that when the responder to a 1NT opening bid is dealt exactly 5-4 in the majors and at least invitational strength, he should use Stayman instead of a Jacoby transfer. Once again, a similar principle applies after a 2NT opening bid.

hs|ss|at|Depending upon the opener's major suit distribution, either 3NT, 4@H, or 4@S could be the best game contract. With 5-4 in the majors, the responder should bid 3@C as the Stayman convention - it would be a mistake to transfer to hearts instead.

|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ht|q|va|9|at|If the opener bids 3@H or 3@S in response to Stayman, he will be promising 4 cards in that suit and the responder can raise him to game, secure in the knowledge that at least an 8-card major suit fit must be present.

|cs|1|at|^-{ |ia|o2n?|at| }

^-In SAYC, all of the notrump responses to a 2NT opening bid mean exactly what you would expect them to mean, but this bidding system leaves several of the other possible direct responses to a 2NT opening as undefined. For example, the 3@S response and all of the 4-level suit responses (except for 4@C which is Gerber) have no official meaning in SAYC.

It is beyond the scope of this program to go into great detail about reasonable meanings to assign to these bids, but for serious partnerships who want to improve the accuracy of their bidding, here are some suggestions. Please understand that these suggestions are not part of SAYC. If you like these ideas and want to use them, make sure to discuss the implications thoroughly with your regular partner!

|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Use the 3@S response to a 2NT opening as minor suit Stayman. This convention is used 
 to describe a hand with at least 5-4 in the minor suits and at least mild interest in slam. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


at|Minor suit Stayman is arguably the most popular use of the 3@S response to a 2NT opening when Jacoby transfers are being used. A lot of partnerships use the 2@S response to 1NT for the same purpose (instead of a bid that is used for signing off in 3@C or 3@D as it is in SAYC).

|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


cs|3|At|^-{ Use the 4@H and 4@S responses to 2NT to describe hands with at least 6 cards in the suit bid

^-{ Responding to 2NT opening bids - Review and Exercises }
^-
|cp||at|Regardless of the bidding system that a partnership is using, accurate bidding after a 2NT opening bid is not easy. The reason is that the 2NT opening itself takes up a lot of bidding space. There is not much room between the opening bid and the most common game contracts. In SAYC, the responder has some useful tools at his disposal that will often allow the partnership to overcome this difficulty.

We saw that Jacoby transfer bids are very useful for investigating the best possible contract when the opening bid was 1NT. This excellent convention is also used in SAYC over a 2NT opening bid.

|cs|2|at|^-{ 3@D and 3@H are Jacoby transfers after a 2NT opening bid. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at|One of the main goals of constructive bidding is for the partnership to try to find an 8-card major suit fit. The Stayman convention and Jacoby transfer bids are a solid foundation for meeting this objective in SAYC over both 1NT and 2NT openings. There are a lot of ways that the bidding can go after one of these conventions is used, but in most cases the bidding sequences that occur after a 2NT opening are analogous in meaning to those that follow a 1NT opening bid. This makes it easier to learn how things work in SAYC after a 2NT opening.

nt|^b@2^z@3
Here is a reminder of some of the similarities between bidding over 1NT and bidding over 2NT:

|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ The 3@D transfer promises 5 or more hearts (as did the 2@D transfer over 1NT). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The 3@H transfer promises 5 or more spades (as did the 2@H transfer over 1NT). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ When a Jacoby transfer is used after a 2NT opening, the opener almost always
 completes the transfer by bidding 3 of the major suit that the responder has shown. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ If the opener has a maximum hand with 4-card support for the responder's major,
 he can super-accept the transfer by jumping (in this case to 4 of his partner's major). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ If the responder has 5-4 or 5-5 in the majors and not enough strength to force to game, 
 he should transfer to his longest and strongest major and then pass at his next turn. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The responder should almost always use Jacoby when he has a 5-card major. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at|As with a 1NT opening bid, the responder to a 2NT opening should use Stayman (and not Jacoby) when he has 5-4 in the majors and game interest. With all other hands that contain a 5-card (or longer) major suit, the responder to a 2NT opening should use a Jacoby transfer.

|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at|One important difference between bidding over a 1NT opening and bidding over a 2NT opening is that there are no bidding sequences that are defined as being invitational to game when the opening bid is 2NT - all sequences are either forcing to game or signoffs.
|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The responder's possible rebids after he uses a Jacoby transfer over a 2NT opening and the opener completes the transfer are also similar in nature to the corresponding actions when the opening bid was 1NT:

|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ To sign off in 3 of a major, the responder to a 2NT opening should transfer to his
 5-card (or longer) major suit and pass when the opener completes the transfer. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ After a 2NT opening and a Jacoby transfer, the responder's 3NT rebid asks the opener 
 to choose between 3NT and 4 of the responder's major (based on his trump support).  }
^-
|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer bid followed by a 4NT rebid is not Blackwood - it is a quantitative try 
 for slam that is based on a balanced hand with exactly 5 cards in the major that was shown. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ To sign off in 4 of a long major after a 2NT opening bid, transfer to your 
 major and then rebid 4 of your major (which your partner will pass). }
^-
|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer followed by the bid of a new suit describes a hand with at least a 5 cards
 in the major, at least 4 cards in the new suit, and at least mild interest in a slam contract. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Transfer to hearts and rebid 3@S with slam interest and at least 5-5 in the majors.  
 Transfer to spades and rebid 4@H with at least 5-5 in the majors and no interest in slam. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ With 5-4 in the majors and game forcing strength, the responder to a 2NT opening should 
 use Stayman, planning to raise 3@H or 3@S and to rebid 3 of his 5-card major over 3@D. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|Here is a summary of all of the defined responses to a 2NT opening bid in SAYC. All direct responses to 2NT that are not listed here are currently not defined (and thus presumed natural):

|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ 3@C - Stayman. The opener rebids a 4-card major if he has one and 3@D otherwise. }

|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ 3@D and 3@H - Jacoby transfer bids. The opener usually completes the transfer. }

|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ 3NT - A signoff bid. The opener should always pass. }

|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ 4@C - The Gerber convention (asking the opener how many Aces he was dealt). }

|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ 4NT - Invitational to 6NT. Opener passes with a minimum and bids 6NT with a maximum. }

|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ 5NT - Invitational to 7NT. Opener bids 6NT with a minimum and bids 7NT with a maximum. }

|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ 6NT - A signoff bid. The opener should always pass. }

|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ 7NT - A signoff bid. There is nowhere left for the opener to go! }

|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


at|^-Finally, 2 suggestions for improving SAYC after a 2NT opening bid were presented. First, the undefined 3@S response to 2NT can be used as minor suit Stayman (showing a hand with length in both minors and at least mild slam interest). Second, the undefined 4@H and 4@S responses to 2NT can be used to show hands with at least 6 cards in the suit bid and mild slam interest.  If you want to use these suggestions, make sure to discuss them with your regular partner as they are not part of the SAYC bidding system!

|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|At|In each of the following exercises, your partner opens the bidding with 2NT. You make a Jacoby transfer bid to show your 5-card (or longer) major suit and your partner completes the transfer. What would you rebid with each of the following hands?

hc|dj|ht|r|at|You should pass. You have 1 HCP |
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


lc|dj|hs|sh|at|and, even when you include the 2 long suit points that your 6-card heart suit is worth, you have only 3 total points. That's not enough for a game contract opposite a hand with 20-21 HCP.

Your hand should win at least a few tricks with hearts as trump, but it would not be surprising if you could not win a single trick with this hand at notrump. 3@H should therefore be a better contract than 2NT, even though it is a level higher. That doesn't mean that your partner will necessarily win 9 tricks with hearts as trump, but that is much more likely than him being able to win 8 tricks at notrump opposite your awful hand!

hs|sd|at|Rebid 3NT despite the fact that you have an unbalanced hand with a second 5-card suit that your partner does not know about. It might be nice to be able to bid your diamonds now, but 4@D would suggest interest in slam in the SAYC bidding system.

lc|dkjsq|hs|sssd|at|and 2 long suit points (1 for each of your 5-card suits). 7 total points is enough to suggest that some game contract will have a good chance facing a 20-21 HCP 2NT opening, but it is not enough to suggest to your partner that there may be a slam in the cards.

|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


ls|ss|At|Rebidding 4@D might work out in that this bid will sometimes get the partnership to 5@D which may well be the best game contract. However, there is a better chance that 4@D will backfire. Your partner will think you have a stronger hand if you bid 4@D and he may well drive to a slam contract that has no chance. |
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|ss|At|It is best to rebid 3NT and hope that the game contract you belong in is either 3NT or 4@S. |

hs|sc|at|This is an example of hand where you should show your second suit after your partner completes the transfer. 4@C is the correct rebid.

pg| ***** 108 ***** |


lc|hajdkjcq|hs|sh|at|and 1 long suit point for the 5-card heart suit, you have 12 total points. |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


hs|sc|at|A small slam is a definite possibility, but the best slam could be 6@C, 6@H, or 6NT (depending on the number of cards that your partner holds in your 2 long suits).

|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


at|Your 4@C rebid describes a hand with at least 5 hearts, at least 4 clubs, and at least some interest in playing in slam. You can expect your partner to take some kind of aggressive action if he has a maximum hand for his 2NT opening. If your partner is minimum he will either bid 4@H or 5@C next when he has a fit for one of your suits. If he has a minimum hand without a fit for either hearts or clubs, he will go back to notrump by bidding 4NT (which would be an attempt to sign off, not Blackwood, in this bidding sequence).

ls|ss|hc|sj|at|even though you have only 1 HCP. |
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


lc|sj|hs|ss|at|Your 8-card spade suit is worth 4 long suit points. Altogether this hand is worth 5 total points and that is enough to take a shot at a game contract given that your partner has shown 20-21 HCP with his 2NT opening bid.

|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


at|As to the question of which game contract to play, there is really no choice. In fact, you have an 8-card major suit fit all by yourself! Your partner must have at least 2 spades for his 2NT opening bid. There is no question that spades will be an adequate trump suit.

Of course there are no guarantees that your partner will be able to win 10 tricks with spades as trump, but that is not your problem. Rebid 4@S, put down your dummy, and enjoy the show!

lc|sahkqcq|hs|sh|at|and 1 long suit point for your 5-card heart suit. Your 12 total points mean that a small slam is a distinct possibility if you partner has a maximum hand for his 20-21 HCP 2NT opening. 4NT is not Blackwood here - it is a quantitative raise suggesting a balanced hand with exactly 5 cards in hearts.

|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


at|If your partner has at least 3-card heart support he will sign off in 5@H with a minimum hand and jump to 6@H if he has a maximum. If he has a doubleton heart he will pass 4NT with a minimum and jump to 6NT with a maximum. All bases are covered and you rate to end up in the right contract given your partner's exact strength and distribution.

nt|^b@2^z@3
In each of the following quizzes you are dealt a major 2-suiter and your partner opens the bidding with 2NT. Think about how you would bid each of the following hands as the responder.

|hs|ss|ht|o|va|5|at|Respond 3@H as a Jacoby transfer to 3@S, intending to pass when your partner completes the transfer. |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|sh|at|Although you have 4 hearts, you cannot safely cater to both major suits by bidding 3@C as the Stayman convention. Using Stayman would be a big success if your partner rebid 3@H or 3@S, but if he rebid 3@D then things would only get worse (since a 3@S rebid by you would be forcing to game).

|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


ls|sh|hc|hjcj|at|You have only 2 HCP |
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


lc|hjcj|hs|ss|at|and even when you add a long suit point for your 5-card spade suit, your 3 total points are not enough to force to game opposite a 20-21 HCP 2NT opening bid. The best you can do on this hand is to try to get out in 3@S (which rates to be a better contract than 2NT). |
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


hs|sh|at|It doesn't matter that your hearts are stronger than your spades. Length is more important than strength when it comes to selecting a trump suit!|

If he has such a hand, he will make some kind of forward-going bid (such as a cuebid of 4@C or 4@D). That will be all the encouragement that you will need to drive to a small slam.|bt||nt||cs|5|cp|6|fp|4|ht|i|at|^-{^^End^^
