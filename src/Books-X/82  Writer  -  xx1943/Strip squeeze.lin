This was 'face to face' (ftf) bridge therefore no self-alert. You must alert and explain partners bidding.|

The double was not alerted by South, because it is not allowed by the rules to alert doubles. 
Therefore I asked her what the meaning of this X is and got the answer: Lead directing!!|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|2H|nt|I thought about 3 possible bids:
1) pass showing: No 4 card major. Sure another lie. But I have 4333 :=)
2) XX showing minimum 4 clubs wanting to play 2 clubs XX. Next lie but worth a try?
3) 2 hearts ; the 'book' bid. I feared Santa Claus and was a good boy. Lol !!!! |

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|My partner was afraid of club ruffs and decided to play NT instead of hearts!
There are many hands where 3NT is much better than 4 major despite of a 4/4 or 5/4 fit.
This will be part of our lesson about bidding judgement.|

After bidding and this lead, I'm sure of the distribution:
South didn't obey partners lead director and led here bad diamonds. 
Why she doesn't led a club?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at| She is void in Clubs. 
Why didn't she led a spade?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at| She has only 4. 
South's distribution must be|

at| 5440 and therefore North's 3316.|

nt|I see 10 tricks for sure 2S+3H+3D+2C.
In the other room the contract will be probably 4 hearts made. So I can gain 1 IMP of I make on overtrick.|

nt|Before I played to the next trick I showed RHO my hand and explained:
I'll play diamond K and throw spade from the table
1) If you throw a club and retain 2 spades, I'll duck a club to you and make spade K and 2 more clubs.
2) If you throw a spade, I'll cash my spade K and run the 8 of clubs to you, you are endplayed to lead up into the A10 tenace of clubs.|
