To celebrate Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL) |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| 11th birthday, there was an 8-board Indy tournament - 1 board rounds; 7 minute boards in BBO |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/^*N|CP||AT|on September 14, 2014. All boards were random. The link to tournament result is:

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|This is a very exciting hand. As it turns out nobody can really make any game contract at all but East/West has a lot of spades and West has a lot of points.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|North/South has a good heart fit and South has a lot of distribution. As soon you will see, it is a kind board that many people will get to game but game is not going to make. But let us look how the bidding should go. There are really a lot of possible options.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


sk|s|mb|p|mb|p|NT||lb|*bPlease bid for East.^^1h|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|South has 12 HCP with good distribution, good heart suit, and 1@H bid is clear cut.|mb|1H|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


sk|w|NT||lb|*bPlease help West to find a good bid!^^x|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West has a decision to make. West has the right distribution and the number of high cards to overcall 1N. But he also has the right distribution to make a takeout double.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|What you do here depends on your judgement and what you and your regular partner expect of each other. With an unknown partner, as here, you need to take your best guess as what to bid.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Probably 20 years ago everyone would have bid a takeout double. Now a days there are experts advocating 1N overcall with this hand. Personally I prefer a takeout double.|mb|d|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat is the North to do?^^4h|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Probably you heard the concept that in competitive auctions a jump, 3@H here, is pre-emptive. If not try to learn it from your bridge teacher or your bridge mentor.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that North's hand is a bit too good to bid a pre-emptive jump and it is not really that suitable to bid 4@H. For 4@H the hand needs a bit more distribution than that.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|2@H does not seem right either with 5 trumps. If you give this hand to a panel of experts you will see many different bids that they would prefer. My guess is that most of them will choose the 4@H bid.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|There is the Law of Total Trick which suggests that with a known ten-card trump you can bid to the 4 level immediately.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now we come to East. He does not have many high cards or a great deal of distribution. But there are many reasons that East should consider bidding 4@S. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The reasons being, a) East/West can make 4@S, b) it may be a good sacrifice when North/South make 4@H, or c) it could push North/South to 5@H and they go down.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|When you are not Vul and the opponents are that is the best time for sacrifice. After all is said and done, the 4@S bid by East is a very solid choice.|NT||AT|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|South does not have any good reason to compete at the 5 level and should pass. The final contract would be 4@S by East.|mb|p|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|South has an interesting choice of lead. You cannot criticize South if he leads @HA. Partner bid to the 4 level in hearts. So there is good reason to believe that partner has the @HK—and it turns out North does not have it. Though I am not a fan of leading Ace from that combination, the @HA lead is okay for me.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|At our table South chose to lead the singleton club which certainly could have been the wining lead. Here we will continue the play with that lead.|pc|c7|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||sk|e|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer should be thinking that South is short in clubs. He can see 2 clubs higher than seven missing—@CQ and @C9. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that South led from @CQ97 which is very unusual. Most likely declarer should think that he has a loser in clubs regardless—probably @cQ.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|In suit contract, declarer should count his losers. Unfortunately there are a few of them here. In order to be able to make the contract he should hope for no ruffs. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|That means the trumps need to be 2-2. But still there is a heart loser, almost certainly a club loser because the North most likely has the @CQ, and it looks that there are 2 diamond losers too. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately, by leading a heart to the dummy the declarer can set up a discard for one of the diamond loser. Declarer should keep his losers to one @D, one @C and one @H.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out in the actual hand that is not possible.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|He should do so by playing @SK first followed by the @SA because at the end of third trick he wants to be in his hand to lead a heart toward the @HK. So he can set up the discard for a diamond as soon as possible—assuming South does have the @HA and plays it.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|My partner with no 4-card major bid 2@D. At our table, I did something a bit unusual and choose to pass the 2@D Stayman response by my partner. My thinking here was that my partner probably has 3 hearts at the most and I was worried that the opponents may lead hearts against NT and most likely they have 8 hearts between the two of them.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|I was also worried that my partner's hand is such that my diamond suit might be blocked if for example my partner had @DKQ doubleton where partner cannot overtake the diamond without setting a trick for the opponents. |

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Or partner could have @DQJ9. Partner leads @DQ for a finesse, it gets covered, and he wins with the @DA and could not back to the dummy anymore.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You may have heard of a convention called ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n. In the ancient times, if you had 4-4-6-1 and your partner opened 1N, your RHO passed you bid 2@C Stayman even if you had only ^*Bone point^*n intending to pass whatever partner bid. That is the original concept and many still use it. Nowadays there are variations of that.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|In one variation if you have a very weak hand with 5-5 in majors facing a 1N opener you can bid 2@C ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n. You would gladly pass any major partner bids. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|However, if he bids 2@D you bid 2@H telling partner you have a weak hand with both majors and pick whichever you like. He will pass with longer heart suit or bids 2@S if his spade suit is longer. |

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Nowadays that is what most play and call it ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n. But here as you see my hand is not an example of ^*BGarbage Stayman^*n in its classic sense.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|At my table East choose to lead @S8 which I think is a pretty reasonable lead on the bidding. Often I am a fan of leading partner's suit—clubs here. But in this case by bidding 1N over 1@C North advertised strength in clubs. So there is a decent chance that leading partner's suit—clubs—you will be helping North to set up additional tricks.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|East does not want to lead away from @HA and you do not want to lead trumps from that combination. Therefore, the @S8 lead was a good lead though it did not work out particularly well.|pc|s8|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|From West point the @S8 indicated partner is short in spades. There are a few card higher and a few are lower which he can see.

mb|1D|sk|w|lb|*bPlease bid for West.^^1s|mb|1S|NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|I choose to overcall 1@S—an aggressive bid—which was not very prudent and did not work that well. I certainly did not have many high cards and did not have the greatest spade suit or a lot of distribution. |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|And as we were vulnerable, to me this is pretty marginal bid. It was more questionable given that I was playing with an unknown partner and I had no idea what he would expect from a vulnerable overcall. However, in my regular partnership this is a normal 1 level overcall even vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Further, a singleton and @S10 and @S8 did play a role in my bidding. This is again one of those style issues. How bad a hand can be and still be worth of a vulnerable overcall. |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Neither me or any one else should tell you that there is a right or wrong answer to that question. You and your partner should figure it by yourself in what you need to make a vulnerable overcall in your partnership.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Sorry that I am harping on the style issue. However, if you are going to be a serious bridge player you need to discuss issues such is vulnerable overcall. I would say that if someone is going to tell you this hand categorically is or is not an obvious overcall, they should not talk to you that way.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It is important to recognize that there is such a thing in bridge as style. And there are some areas of bridge which there are no right or wrong answers. It is what we do and what we like to do with hands like this.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|East has a pretty nice hand opposite of 1@S overcall. Good 4-card support, 13 HCP and pretty good distribution. However, my partner is in tough spots because he does not know what to expect from West—^*Ban unknown partner^*N.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, the warning signs are out and East even with great hand opposite a vulnerable overcall should have been content for a 3@S partscore. But my partner bid 4@S. And we play it that way now.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Conceivably I could open 1N. I have no problem opening 1N with 5-card major. So I judged that another reasonable action would be to open 1@H and rebid 2N. My 2N rebid would be a slight overbid as you need 18-19 point for a 2N rebid. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|However, the advantage of bidding 1@H would be to get your 5-card major into the game right away. Further, it is likely that you may not be able to introduce your heart suit later if you open such hands 1N. |

lc|hak965|NT||cp|5|AT|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|North has difficult hand to bid. The hand is too strong for a 2@H raise. Further, you do not want to jump to 3@H with only 3-card support with such a balanced hand. This is really a perfect hand for Drury convention.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Of course we did not discuss such convention with each other beforehand. It could be not part of SAYC—I could be wrong. But, my partner did a battlefield decision.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|North hand has many signs pointing to NT. A balanced distribution, excellent spot cards, and you know you have many points between the hands. North has 11 points and I promised 18-19 points for 29-30 points. |

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You can easily make 3N with the two hands while with other hands 4@H conceivably could go down if the defense got a ruff or trumps broke badly. Bad things can happen in suit contract which cannot happen in NT contract.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|And here you can see that playing in 4@H, if West is divine enough to lead a club. The defense can get @CA, @CQ, and a club ruff. That is the first three tricks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
qx|BLUNT,|AT|
^*BMM:^*N Big Mouth that I am I have a few blunt words for those who are getting this great teaching material. But first let me share with you what one of the BILies wrote to me.

"|CP|6|at|The membership has absolutely no idea what the costs associated with the BIL are, i.e., who gets paid? what they are paid? and is it any of their business?  Actually no. What we, the membership, should be aware of, however, is that there are costs.  
When I joined, I paid a nominal fee for a “life-time” membership.  To be honest, I had no idea what I was buying — totally unaware of the fantastic classes (which would cost a bloody fortune to take live), the expert teachers, the wide variety of approaches, and the ability to play 24 hours a day (at no cost) - live bridge cost any where from $5 to $8 a game depending on where you’re playing or $11 plus  a session at Sectionals, Regionals, and the Nationals.  I know I’ve reaped 50 times, in not more, than my initial outlay to join.  Consequently, I make a small yearly donation, not much - just $50 to try and help just a little.  I think this is the point that needs emphasis.  The membership is receiving so much for such a pittance.|CP||AT|"

^*BMM^*N: Yes, no one who works for BIL gets paid.  Maureen (full time), Teachers, Mentors, Movie Makers, BILAssists, BBP, SET, BILFriends, BILHosts, TDs and more. Think about how many hours of lessons, guest visits, practice sessions you attend in the BILies Retreat, how many hours at Courses held in the LearnBrdge Classroom, how many hours of mentoring have you received, how many BIL tournaments have you played in, all the resources available in the BIL Library and much more.

Now let me tell you what is the estimated cost to make this masterpiece at a bargain price. I transcribed more than 140 minutes of audio. At a bargain price of $1.29 min by online vender that = $180. |CP|6|AT|^*Htranscriptdivas.com/transcription-rate^*N|CP||AT|.

I spent 40 hours minimum doing this presentation. In La Jolla even the illegal immigrants make $15 per hour to do odd jobs and gardening. So I am worth $600 though my hourly rate used to be 40 times that much—but I could not get 40 hours a week though -:). I am sure you cannot afford my hourly rate! My lady proof reader probably spent 10 hours and we should pay her the equal rate. 

So the conservative cost for this presentation is $180 + $600 + $150 = $930.00. That does not factor in the time a World Champion bridge player gave and the hours that Maureen and her helpers spent to arrange the event.

Now then don't you think you ^*Bshould^*N make a donation to the Beginner Intermediate Lounge of even a fraction of the cost of making this masterpiece?   You can contribute at   |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com/BILShop/BILShop.php.^*N|CP||at|

BTW, Maureen censored my reprisal if you do not make the donation—yep all them Royal elephants coming your way -:).|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
