bt||mn|   Think with Fred - in BIL 26 August 07   |ht|e|at|
There was a time in which you would log in to BBO and there would be less than 20 people online - really :) chances were pretty good in those days that all 4 of us would be among those 20 players
we have all been with BBO since day 1 and my opponents have been 2 of the very most important members on our site for many years.

^*bRoland^*  needs no introduction for most of you I would guess since he is probably one of the most famous bridge players in the world Roland is the Howard Cosell (meant as a compliment) of bridge. His dedication to our game and to BBO vugraph in particular has made a LOT of bridge players happy over the years. I can't say enough about the great contributions Roland has made - if we gave out medals for service to bridge, then Roland would get a Gold for sure.

^*bGerardo^*  is the man who makes sure that our servers stay up and running day and night. As I suspect most of you have realized, he does a sensational job - the amount of network problems we have is tiny compared to other online games (especially those with as many people as we have)

These 2 have also become dear friends and it is a pleasure and an honor to have them here.

^*bSheri^*  is my wife and she is prone to embarassment so I won't say much in praise of her but I do have to say that without Sheri there would be no BBO - she does not get as much credit as she deserves :) and she is also a Life Master in the wife department :)|

mn|   THINK WITH FRED   |nt||cs|1|ht|e|at|
During this session I will try to "think aloud" hopefully you will get some sense as to what goes through the mind of a expert player when he is at the table a couple of things to look for:

^-{1) I try to think about possible problems BEFORE they occur so that I can bid/play in tempo if and when the time comes}

^-{2) More important, when I am playing or defending I am constantly counting the hands and trying to form a picture of what the other players have}

This is arguably the single most important skill that you need to master if you are to move beyond the intermediate stage to the players, sorry in advance if i seem to be playing slowly or if some of my chat->kibitzers goes to the table by mistake :)

nt|Here is an easy 1@S opening, but I am already thinking about what i will bid over my partner's most likely response (1NT), not that i know Roland will pass and partner will bid 1NT of course...|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2C!|an|drury|
nt|Sheri and I have a regular partnership so I know she is using the Drury convention, I'm going to go to at least 4@S, but it is possible we have a slam if the hands fit well, you may be shocked at that statement because it is obvious we do not have enough HCP to consider slam, but I can see that I do not have many losers - this hand is a lot stronger than its HCP count suggests and it is entirely possible that Sheri has the "right" hand for me...|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3H|an|natural slam try|
nt|For us my 3@H bid says "I have at least 4 hearts and i have interest in slam" I'm not sure if that is "standard" or not, but since we are a serious partnership we have discussed such things :)|

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5S|
nt|That is an interesting bid by Sheri and again it REALLY helps that we have played together before for us the jump to 5@S suggests a hand that cannot cuebid anything, but has good trumps|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|p|mb|6S|
nt|I don't know for sure, but my guess is that 6@S will be a good spot given the picture i have of Sheri's hand - so I will bid it :) so we bid a slam without any conventions (including blackwood) which is somewhat of a rare occurance in this day and age :)|

nt|For those of you not familiar with Drury... 2@C means "I have at least a limit raise in support of spades" so I know Sheri has some high cards (which gives me reason to hope that my secondary losers in hearts/clubs wil be dealt with somehow|

nt|It's a nice dummy and at first glance it appears i am very likely to make this contract, but i will still be careful of course... in general it is a great habit to get into to think out the whole hand before you play to trick 1.

mb|3C|
nt|When i saw my hand i was anticipating doing a lot of bidding, but it may be that i never bid at all now! while it is possible that we should be playing the hand, Sheri's club preempt makes that somewhat unlikely but that depends partly on her style of preempting... just from a math point of view, it is unlikely we have a good fit in diamonds or hearts. Sheri very likely has 7 clubs meaning she has an average of 2 cards in each of the other 3 suits, if she has secondary length (3 cards in this case) in any other suit it rates to be in spades - not one of my suits because I'm short in spades, she rates to be longer there.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|So my judgment suggests that I forget about playing in a red suit - how about in clubs? suppose she has something like AQxxxxx or KQxxxxx of clubs - very likely holdings. We would then have 6 club tricks plus my AK-A that's 9 tricks and maybe one more is available in the wash. But 11 tricks in clubs is very far away - I think I will give up on playing this hand and see where the opps end up, maybe I will get a chance to double them.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|I won't DBL 3@S but i will DBL 4@S. OK I will go quietly - I'm guessing we are likely to beat this, but i am not confident enough to DBL, DBLing a partscore is dangerous business. If they go down 1 I gain 50 points by DBLing, but if they make I lose 300 points of so :) so you have to be careful when you DBL most partscores - 2@C and 2@D are different since you are not doubling them into game so you lose less if they make it.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|HT|
nt|Looks like i should have DBLed this time :)
I strongly suspect Sheri has 2 hearts and most, but she could have 109x still, I think I will take my club ruff (she has to have the @CA in our style) before I play more hearts I also know she likely has either 2 diamonds or a void :) if she had a singleton diamond she probably would have led that suit instead of hearts :) so i am guessing Roland has 6313 distribution :)
Sorry i did not notice that i had the @H9 thinking, typing,  and playing at the same time not so easy :)|

nt|But in any case, Sheri's @C10 here is a suit preference signal - I know she wants a heart ruff. I will give her a suit preference signal of my own here to ask for a diamond return (instead of another club), if you are not familiar with suit preference signals: the basic idea is that when you give partner a ruff on defense (among other situations) you play a card that tells partner which of the remaining 2 suits you like more, the trump suit does not figure into the equation - only the other 2 side suits count.|

nt|Notice Roland's disciplined 3@S bid here - I am sure the thought of bidding 4@S crossed through his mind but I think his judgment was excellent. In a situation like this, it is practical bridge for Gerardo to play Roland to have something of value it is *possible* that Roland has a terrible hand with neither shape nor high cards, but it is not likely. So from Roland's point of view, he knows his partner is going to play him to have something of value and that's about all that Roland's hand has - something of value - he does not have more than Gerardo has a "right" to expect it turns out Gerardo had a minimum for a 3-level takeout DBL so bidding game was not an issue for him.

^*bGerardo:^* yes, a bit sub minimum I think.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|It also turns out i should have DBLed, but imagine if Sheri's clubs were headed by the KQ instead of the AQ we still *might* beat 3@S, but it is really taking an unnecessary risk to DBL it. For the record I agree with your DBL Gerardo.

^*bWalddk2:^* Indeed

Would be nice to have a little more, but you have to play with what you are dealt :) if preempts didn't make life harder for the opps there would be no reason to preempt :)|

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|
nt|And it just got scarier! I am going to bid 2@D here which for us is defined as a "waiting bid" (but a hand that is not terrible - we play another convention that i would use if my hand was really awful) I could bid 3@D to show a long strong suit, but i have so many suits (3!) that i want to give us as much space as possible to find a fit this is the sort of lesson you learn from experience (generally the hard way) :) I would go as far as to say that if 2@D is a possible response to 2@C on your hand, you should almost always choose that bid.|

nt|For now i will start with Stayman - if partner has a major then i will have an easy bid next.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|
nt|What is this hand worth? should i drive to slam? or just invite slam? I have to make some kind of forward going move at least and i am lucky that we use a convention here that will help... I can bid 4@H to mean "i am interested in a spade slam" this is not exactly a standard convention, but it is logical. If i had 5+ hearts i would have transferred over 2NT and if I had less than 5 hearts I would not be introducing the suit now|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


mb|4H|an|Art slam try in @S|mb|d|
nt|Roland's DBL has definitely made my hand worse - I don't like the idea of a heart opening lead|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


mb|r|
nt|But Sheri's RDBL is a good sign - it means she has the @HA. Again this may not be "standard" but because we play together seriously i know this. Not that this makes my next bid easier.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


mb|p|
nt|The problem is that for slam to be good, one thing i know for sure is that Sheri must have good trumps. I don't really have a bid to say "do you have good trump?" and I could cuebid 5@C or 5@D, but i do not expect Sheri will get the picture of my strange hand so i think i will just have to guess.

We could be laydown for 7 (especially if she has 5 spades) and 6 might have no play (if she has Axxx of spades for example) but i will guess 6 and hope i get lucky.

pc|HT|
nt|Lucky and unlucky - she had the spades I need, but she has too much in clubs and nothing in diamonds. And more unluckiness is that the diamond finesse is wrong :( welcome to Uday who is the 3rd partner in BBO (Sheri and I being the other 2). Note how well Roland did to DBL 4@H - I doubt Gerardo would have led a heart otherwise and on any other lead 6@S is easy Roland's DBL is not the sort of bid you would expect a beginner to find, but it is very instructive in my view. Of course we could have played in 4@H RDBLed and Roland was taking that risk but, in real life that almost never happens.

^*bWalddk2:^* If Gerardo had a natural diamond lead, I would not mind, so double pf 4!H is not obvious|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|In fact, many expert partnerships have agreed that they can NEVER play in a RDBLed cuebid - they use all the followup bids for slam-related purposes. Sheri had a hard hand to bid. She had "only" 21 points and technically 2@C then 2NT shows 22-23. But she also had a lot of quick tricks and a very strong 5-card suit so she "upgraded" her hand by a point good judgment by her i think but another issue is whether or not she should be bidding notrump at all - some would open 1@S or bid 2@C then 2@S again i agree with her judgment in treating her hand as a notrump hand in my experience it is best to treat all balanced hands as balanced hands but again that is a matter for you and your partner to discuss.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|I am not claiming I am "right" about this - i am just telling you what my experience suggests given that Sheri and i share a lot of experience and that we learned bridge in the same part of the world it is not surprising that our judgment on such things is the same :).

In retrospect i wish i had bid 5@C instead of 6@S with Sheri's actual hand this would have worked well (maybe)|
pc|HQ|pc|HK|pc|HA|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^*bWalddk2:^* The contract can actually be made double dummy (with all cards in view) if I am not mistaken.

She would know that I had shortness in clubs (since she had the AK) and that would be bad from her point of view (as was the DBL of hearts - that made Sheri's hand much worse) that is a big @H6 :) it is a very nice hand - Roland is right...

^*bWalddk2:^* Yes, with 108 doubleton|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|But the way to make 6@S is complicated and I can't say i blame sheri for missing it :) a question about the concept of me bidding 5@C instead of 6@S. 5@C would be a cuebid in support of spades (because i already said "we are playing in spades" when i bid 4@H) a cuebid normally shows the Ace (or maybe the King in some cases) but when Sheri knows that she has the AK of clubs, I cannot have either of those cards so i must be short in clubs (singleton or void) to be cuebidding and Sheri will know that her hand is not as good as it could be given that i am short in clubs in general it is bad to have high cards opposite short suits Sheri's hand would be better if i was short in diamonds instead of clubs|

mb|3S!|an|Long solid minor, asking for spade stop|
nt|^*bWalddk2:^* Gerardo and I have never played, so I do not know how he will interpret 3@S by me now. It is usually bid with a long solid minor and asks partner if he can stop spades. If yes, he must bid 3NT.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


mb|d|an|value showing|
nt|It is "standard" among experts to use 3@S to say "do you have a spade stopper - i want you to bid 3NT if you do..." usually the 3@S bidder would have a long SOLID suit that being the case, our side will never want to play 3NT ourselves. So we can use the 3NT bid to mean "i have a strong hand for spades" - like a cuebid the meaning of the DBL then becomes "i have a good hand without spade support".|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


mb|3N|mb|4H|
nt|That being the case, i have an easy 4@H bid - I don't  know for sure, but I suspect we have a heart fit Sheri should know that I don't have a very strong hand - otherwise I would DBL myself and then bid my hearts later (if there is a later) but it is hard to have a super-accurate auction when the opps get in your face to this extent :)|

nt|Well this contract is not that interesting - I assume I will be able to ruff my spades in the dummy - even a really bad break is unlikely to hurt me it is just a question of the timing. I know Gerardo has the @SK from the bidding and I can actually reasonably infer that Roland has 8 clubs since AKJ10 to 8 is a lot closer to SOLID than the same suit with only 7 cards i am not sure if there is a 100% line, but drawing 1 round of trump to start looks good.|

nt|Can i afford to take the spade finesse now? what bad could happen. Roland could have no spades and 3 hearts he would then ruff, cross to Gerardo in diamonds and get another ruff that seems super unlikely to me, but if that is what Roland has, there is no obvious solution anyways. How about if he has a spade void and the remaining hearts are 1-1? Now the danger is that he will ruff the spade, cross in diamonds, and Gerardo will play his last trump maybe i should have ducked the first round of diamonds :) is drawing another trump safe? That will guard against Roland being 0-2-3-8 so it is better than not drawing another trump i think i have spent enough time on this hand so that is what i will do...|

nt|in a "real" tournament I would probably not play a card at trick 2 until i "knew" what i was planning so i can ruff 2 spades in dummy but i will still have to lose a spade and a diamond in practice even the best players are incapable of *always* thinking hands out all the way until the end nobody has concentration that good but the ability to do that as frequently as possible is what separates the men from the boys in bridge there are a LOT of players in the world who are capable of playing as well as anyone on any given hand those who win the mosts are the ones who are capable of playing that well most of the time.

^*bWalddk2:^* I told Fred that I had 8 clubs, but he would have known anyway when he sees @CQ in the dummy. I promised a "solid" suit and when I don't have the queen, I must have 8 of them.|

About playing/bidding "in tempo", i started to talk about that earlier on one of the very first hands, I had 5-5 in the majors and a nice 16 points. I opened 1@S and started to consider what i would do if Sheri had responded 1NT the reason it is good to think about that in advance suppose i had thought for a while when it was my turn to bid then, no matter what I decided, Sheri would know that my hand is on the borderline between the bid I made and some other choice (2@H and 3@H with the hand in question) that will make it a lot harder for her to act ethically - she would have info she is not entitled to this is NOT something that beginners should be concerned about but part of the purpose of this session is to give you a taste of how experts think.|

nt|Here i now sheri has 6 hearts, if roland had 4 hearts he would bid 1@H, not 1NT. So by subtraction from 13 I know Sheri has 6 hearts (or maybe more). Against some partnerships I might be able to draw addition inference from Roland's failure to bid 1@D or 2@C, but against a non-regular partnership that would be dangerous note that I have no idea if Sheri's heart length will be relevant to any decisions i might have to make later or not but if it is I will be happy that I worked that out now - it will any such problem that might occur in the future easier (and faster) for me to work out. One thing i can conclude is that the 6-2 heart break is good for declarer - it is also good for declarer that Sheri probably doesn't have any entries to her long hearts but i can see nothing else to try except to come back a heart and hope somehow Sheri gets in later, I'm not exactly hopeful.|

nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  I am obviously going to play on clubs which offers a good chance of producing 4 tricks. I still have chances if clubs break badly. Spades may be well placed this is a little annoying because I don't know how hearts are divided. The return of the 9 can be the only one Fred has or from J9x originally.If hearts are 5-3 which is quite possible I am in trouble if I play another club.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|One thing the defense has going for it here is that Roland does not know that hearts are 6-2 from his point of view 5-3 is more likely and he might well decide to base his line of play on the assumption that hearts are 5-3 the specific heart spot that Sheri led to the first trick and the card that she follows with here will give Roland some indication of her heart length (as does my @H9).but i don't think he has any way of knowing exactly how many hearts she was dealt note that i can be almost sure that Sheri has the @HK (and that Roland lacks that card) if Rolands hearts were headed by the KQ, he would have won the K at trick 1 - not the Q, for purely psychological reasons - technically it makes no difference as the K and Q are equals of course. But if he plays the K from KQ, Sheri might think that I have the Queen and on some hands that will get her to do the wrong thing.|

nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  Seems like I need hearts to be 6-2 and @CQ with Fred, playing on spades (K10 onside) will not give me enough tricks|

nt|Well done. I have no more hearts  :(

^*bWalddk2:^*  If Fred does not return a heart, he has no more and then I even have a safe spade finesse.
^*bfred:^*  that works too :)
^*bWalddk2:^*  Maybe double finesse works too? :)
^*bfred:^*  now you are getting greedy!
^*bWalddk2:^*  But it's safe :)|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|Yes and it works too, this sort of interplay between opps may seem strange but. In real life it actually happens at the table when some players (especially friends) play against each other and you even see that happen in super-serious tournaments from time to time players "settle" much as Roland and I did there there is no real reason for it except to speed things up so that everyone has more time to put into the more difficult hands

^*bWalddk2:^*  Look how lucky I was that hearts split 6-2. But I did not have as much luck as I might have had in the club suit|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|Of course you don't want to get into a settlement discussion with an opp unless you are certain that your opp is not going to make a mistake :). Sheri's opening lead did not work out very well, but it is completely normal of course (and as it turns out no other lead would come close to beating 3NT on this layout)|

mb|1D|
nt|At this vul I would overcall at the 1-level if i had the chance, but for me this hand is not strong enough for a 2-level overcall, if i had the same hand with a 6-card suit i would then have a minimum 2@C overcall in the style that Sheri and I play I know you are probably getting tired of hearing this but, it should be up to you and your partner to decide what you need to make an overcall at various vulnerabilities and in various positions, teachers and mentors can offer useful advice of course, but nobody knows what is "right" when you have a borderline hand. By far the most important thing is that you and your partner agree.|

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|
nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  Opposite a minimum opener I do not have enough to make a game try although we have a double fit, so I will pass. I expect Sheri to balance and then I may bid again.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


mb|p|mb|d|
nt|This is a nice development - I am delighted that Sheri has balanced her DBL is for takeout, but her early pass has limited her hand - I know she is only competing for the partscore (and that we cannot have enough for game despite my nice hand)|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3C|
nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  What I expected. I am not going to sell out to 3@C. But since Gerardo might have supported hearts with only 3, I will give him a choice of contracts by showing my diamond support. Then he can correct to 3@H if he has 4 of them.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|
nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  4-card heart support confirmed now.

This "balancing" thing is an important part of the game when you play at the higher levels if that word is new to you, don't worry - you will be learning it before too long but it is too big of a subject to say that much about right now one good principle of balancing auctions applies here: do not punish your partner for balancing! I do have a much better hand than i might have had but the mission of the balance is to push the opps to the next level the mission has been accomplishedthe mission would be jeapardized if i were to bid again now with my nice hand :) my attitude is: i am grateful that Sheri pushed them up - maybe we can beat 3@H when we couldn't beat 2@H.|

pc|S4|pc|ST|
nt|We are using "upside down signals" so a high-low by me here will mean "i don't like spades" - the exact opposite of what is "standard" in most of the world using "standard" signals i would play the @S3 here. There is a strong theoretical case for using upside-down signals, but that is not even close to the most important thing about signalling for newish players to learn far more important is getting a good feeling for when a signal should be "attitude" vs. "count" vs. "suit preference". If you do not have a good feel for this yet, I strongly suggest you talk to your teacher/mentor about this subject - it is improtant! If you really want to create some controversey tell the teacher/mentor "stop teaching me more conventions! I want to learn about signals and counting and the stuff Fred says is really important" :)|

pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  This contract has chances. Let's see. I am pretty confident that spades are 4-3 If Sheri had 5, she would have bid them ratther than double, and also the fact that Fred followed with the 10 (upside-down attitude) confirms this. He is telling Sheri that he can't ruff a 3rd spade.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


pc|D3|
nt|If @DK is offside as I expect, I need to guess @HQ later, I am fairly certain that diamonds are 3-3 because Sheri and Fred use 3rd and 5th leads against suit contracts (I think). I will ask them.

^*bWalddk2:^*  3rd and 5th vs suit?
^*bfred:^* Yes
^*bWalddk2:^*  Thanks, what I thought and explained to the kibitzers|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


pc|DQ|
nt|I am not exactly hopeful here, I can see 2 spade tricks for us - I know sheri has only 4 spades because with 5 to the AKJ she would have overcalled 1@S at this vul probably Sheri either doesn't have 4 clubs or she doesn't have much more in high cards otherwise she would have made a takeout double the first time so i can see 4 tricks for us - 2 spades, my @DK and the @CA. Perhaps Sheri has the @HQ and Roland will misguess - if that is what we need to beat the contract then my play doesn't rate to matter meanwhile Roland @DQ play from dummy seems unnatural - why didn't he play low? There are a few possible reasons that make sense, but i won't bore you with the details anyways, I suppose it could be wrong, but i can't bring myself to duck this trick...|

pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|Mentally picturing a hand for Sheri that gives us a chance is not so easy perhaps she is 4243 with the King of clubs - Then I had better cash our 2 club tricks before a club goes away on dummy's diamonds I know that if sheri had that hand she would have passed over 1@H - she would need another club in order to make a takeout DBL with such a minimum hand so that is what I am going to play for - if there is any time that my play matters i think it is the hand i just pictured and i don't think it can cost to play the @CA...|

pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  I must lose a spade for sure. Now I need to guess heart queen, I would like to know who has @CQ If Sheri has it, Fred will likely have @HQ. If Fred has @CQ, @HQ is likely to be with Sheri for her balancing double.

Most likely scenario is that roland has to guess the @HQ otherwise he would be close to claiming but since he may well be typing his thoughts, perhaps that is not a safe inference to draw :)

nt|^*bWalddk2:^*  Gerardo and I have never played before, but I will assume that this is a splinter for spades Singleton or void in hearts I have no idea how strong he is.

^*bGerardo^*  Probably too strong for splinter, as I'd like to go on over 4@S.
|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|Here is the sort of situation where having a serious partnership would help, the splinter bid is a fairly common convention, but there is not exactly a standard worldwide agreement as to how strong a bid it is for my partners a splinter is roughly 10-12 HCP or a VERY strong hand (ie a hand that is always going to slam unless 2 Aces are missing). If you have something in between, say 14 HCP, it is a bad idea to splinter because you will likely give yourself another problem on the next round, if partner signs off over your splinter, it is important that you know what you are going to do, with my definition of a splinter this is easy - you know you will pass or you know you will bid with the 14-15 point hand, you won't know what to do! that is a good argument for not making the bid in the first place :)|
