To celebrate Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL) |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| 11th birthday, there was an 8-board Indy tournament - 1 board rounds; 7 minute boards in BBO |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/^*N|CP||AT|on September 14, 2014. All boards were random. The link to tournament result is:

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West next bid is open for discussion. West has a hand which he could look for slam. 18 HCP, good trump suit, and good texture. However, there is no rush to jump to ace asking.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 3@H when I was playing this hand. This is the Help Suit Game Try or Game Try. Partner's first responsibly, here is to evaluate his hand for possibility of Game.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|You can bid the 3@H—HSGT—with the same distribution but (with 10 to 11 points). With a hand that you are not sure that you belong to game or not.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now I knew that my partner would have raised my heart without 4-card support.

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|As North, I lead @CK here. There are those who believe that you should lead a trump against grand slam. However, I would be very happy to lead from King-Queen-Jack.|pc|cK|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||sk|w|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now if trumps were divided 3-2 this would be a really easy hand to play. You draw three rounds of trump and eventually discard @C on the fifth spade and ruff your club in the dummy and @dA and @DK would take care of your 2 loosing diamonds.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, at least it seems sensible to start by drawing trumps after winning the opening lead in hand. Because you can actually claim if the trumps break. So let us draw couple rounds of trumps.|

NT||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|d3|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Now you can see that drawing the rest of trumps are not going to work. Because if you do that then you can count only on 12 tricks. We can count our trick 5 spades, 4 hearts, the @DA @DK and @CA which is 12. But we need 13 tricks.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The only way to get that, get 13 tricks, is through the trump suit—you will not get the extra trick if you draw another round of trumps.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately there is an easy answer. Instead of ruffing a club in the dummy I can ruff a diamond in the declarer's hand. Watch how is it done.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|It is probable that some of you sitting South may overcall 2@C with my hand. South has enough points to do so. But on this particular hand I decided to pass. When I am vulnerable I would like to have better suit for an overcall at the 2 level.

PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|This is a matter of style. I am sure there are very good players who might overcall with my hand. But I am relatively conservative in this situation. At one level I would have bid.|

NT||lb|*bPlease bid for West.^^1n|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West had a hand close enough enough to bid 2@D. In SAYC you only need ten points to do that.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|At our table West bid 1N which is a reasonable option as well. I prefer the 1N because you would have problem for rebid if you had bid 2@D if your partner happened to rebid spades.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West probably could pass the 2@S which I am not sure you can do that. Other bids could be either an overbid, an underbid or the distortion of West's hand. In summary 1N has a lot going for it.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The message of the 2N in this bidding cycle is that West has a maximum hand for the bid and you have both of the minors stopped.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|If west did not have the maximum, he could pass the 2@H or bid 2@S. It is not usual to see 1N followed by 2N. However, West had the perfect hand for the bid.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|North had a tough choice for opening lead. Normally in NT you like to lead from your longest suit. But East already bid both long suits held by North—spades and hearts. It is a good policy in NT not to lead from the suits that opponents explicitly bid.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|So it leaves the minors. North was smart to choose his better minor—clubs. North led @C9. The lead from J98 is mainly based on prior agreement. Regardless the @C9 is a reasonable lead if you are going to choose that suit.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


pc|C9|pc|C3|NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Of course I was very happy that my partner lead a card in my 5-card suit.

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||sk||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, it was difficult for me to play the correct card. Eventually I decided to tell my partner that I liked clubs and played @C5—an encouraging signal—instead of playing my @CQ.|

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|By inference now, I understood that Partner has the @CJ otherwise declarer would play the @CJ, if he had the @Cj instead of @CA.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|However, Declarer has shown strength in minors and now is playing the @D. Therefore, it appeared to me that Declarer has strong @D holding. Therefore, I thought it would be smart for me to hold on the my @DA.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The North hand has a lot going for him. Again this is a matter of style. There are places in the bridge world that everyone opens this hand. And there are places that no one opens this hand. I have no particular objection to either opening or not opening this hand. Your partnership should make such decisions.|

^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|South has the points for opening the hand 1N. But South has 2 doubletons. 1@D is a great bid too. And you do not expect any rebid problem whatever partners response would be. At my table I opened the hand 1N but later I will show you the hand opening would be 1@D.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I opened the hand 1N, again I was playing with an unknown partner and I feel opening this hand 1N makes the bidding simpler. As it turns out we will get to the same contract opneing 1N or 1@D. Let us proceed with 1N for now.|

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|West has Two-Suited hand. Five hearts and five clubs. 2N, the unusual 2N, is a good bid for West. If the RHO bids a major then 2N ,the unusual no trump, shows 5-5 in the minors with enough points to compete in the 3-level.|mb|2N|

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly if the RHO opens a minor you still can bid 2N as an unusual no trump. Here the 2N shows hearts and the other minor.|

NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|There is an easy way to remember. The 2NT always promises the two lower ranking unbid suits. Here the two lower ranking unbid suits are hearts and clubs.|

UB|1|NT||mb|1N|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Please note that West is already passed. So West can bid 1N which is the unusual 1N. If not passed hand, With 15-17 HCP and diamonds stopped West could bid 1NT. But now West cannot have 15-17 HCP—he is a passed hand. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*BFred Gitelman: ^*N|cp||at|Once West passed his 1NT basically says the same thing as the unusual 2NT with less value. So West can bid unusual 1N if he does not feel brave enough to bid 2NT.|

%%%%%%%blunt
qx|BLUNT,|AT|
^*BMM:^*N Big Mouth that I am I have a few blunt words for those who are getting this great teaching material. But first let me share with you what one of the BILies wrote to me.

"|CP|6|at|The membership has absolutely no idea what the costs associated with the BIL are, i.e., who gets paid? what they are paid? and is it any of their business?  Actually no. What we, the membership, should be aware of, however, is that there are costs.  
When I joined, I paid a nominal fee for a “life-time” membership.  To be honest, I had no idea what I was buying — totally unaware of the fantastic classes (which would cost a bloody fortune to take live), the expert teachers, the wide variety of approaches, and the ability to play 24 hours a day (at no cost) - live bridge cost any where from $5 to $8 a game depending on where you’re playing or $11 plus  a session at Sectionals, Regionals, and the Nationals.  I know I’ve reaped 50 times, in not more, than my initial outlay to join.  Consequently, I make a small yearly donation, not much - just $50 to try and help just a little.  I think this is the point that needs emphasis.  The membership is receiving so much for such a pittance.|CP||AT|"

^*BMM^*N: Yes, no one who works for BIL gets paid.  Maureen (full time), Teachers, Mentors, Movie Makers, BILAssists, BBP, SET, BILFriends, BILHosts, TDs and more. Think about how many hours of lessons, guest visits, practice sessions you attend in the BILies Retreat, how many hours at Courses held in the LearnBrdge Classroom, how many hours of mentoring have you received, how many BIL tournaments have you played in, all the resources available in the BIL Library and much more.

Now let me tell you what is the estimated cost to make this masterpiece at a bargain price. I transcribed more than 140 minutes of audio. At a bargain price of $1.29 min by online vender that = $180. |CP|6|AT|^*Htranscriptdivas.com/transcription-rate^*N|CP||AT|.

I spent 40 hours minimum doing this presentation. In La Jolla even the illegal immigrants make $15 per hour to do odd jobs and gardening. So I am worth $600 though my hourly rate used to be 40 times that much—but I could not get 40 hours a week though -:). I am sure you cannot afford my hourly rate! My lady proof reader probably spent 10 hours and we should pay her the equal rate. 

So the conservative cost for this presentation is $180 + $600 + $150 = $930.00. That does not factor in the time a World Champion bridge player gave and the hours that Maureen and her helpers spent to arrange the event.

Now then don't you think you ^*Bshould^*N make a donation to the Beginner Intermediate Lounge of even a fraction of the cost of making this masterpiece?   You can contribute at   |CP|6|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com/BILShop/BILShop.php.^*N|CP||at|

BTW, Maureen censored my reprisal if you do not make the donation—yep all them Royal elephants coming your way -:).|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
