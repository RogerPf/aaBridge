^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 386 - February 2, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BTim Bourke^*N in the semi-final of the recent ^*BAustralian National Open Teams^*N. This deal was sent to be by none other than ^*BSabine Auken^*N. When a person as special as Sabine sends you a deal, chances are the deal is pretty special too. That proved to be the case with this week's deal - it is one of the nicest that I have seen in recent memory.

Tim Bourke is well known as one of Australia's leading bridge players and journalists. Less well known is that he owns what is perhaps the world's largest collection of bridge books and magazines. Anyone with a collection like that must really love the game. You can bet that it gave Tim a great deal of pleasure to find the winning line of play in this week's deal.

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nc|at|There was just too much work to do for this line to come off, especially given that the defenders had started attacking the dummy's entries. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nc|hs|sd|Hs|nh|at|Tim judged that his chances would be better if he played for as many diamond ruffs in the dummy as were possible. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|nd|ls|nh|nt|He therefore started with a diamond to his @DA, |

ls|sd|pc|D4|sk||hs|eh|hs|wh|at|these are the cards that remained. Note that West was dealt 4 natural trump tricks. On the surface you might think that it would be impossible to make 4@H under these circumstances, but Tim had won 8 tricks already and there was no way to prevent him from winning 2 more tricks in the endgame. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|eh|hs|wc|hs|nh|nt|If West had discarded his last club, Tim would have won his 9th trick at once with a ruff in the dummy. |

hs|wh|at|A trump return was out of the question |

up|7|hs|nh|ls|sh|ls|wh|ls|es|ls|ed|nt|Tim avoided this fate by ruffing West's club return with the dummy's @H6. |
