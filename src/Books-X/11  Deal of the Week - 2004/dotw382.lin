^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 382 - January 5, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a play problem that ^*BChip Martel^*N sent me by e-mail.

Chip has long been one of the bridge players that I admire most in the world (and not just for his great skill at the bridge table). When Chip is not busy winning World and North American Championships, he is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California in Davis. Chip and his wife Jan (also a terrific player) have both been popular vugraph commentators during some of the ^*Blive^*N broadcasts of major tournaments that are presented through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N), the ^*Bfree^*N online bridge service that was developed by my company.

Speaking of ^*BBBO^*N vugraph, tournaments from India, Scotland, Germany, and The Netherlands will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N in January. For a schedule of upcoming vugraph broadcasts on ^*BBBO^*N, visit:

Yesterday there were over 3000 people logged in to ^*BBBO^*N at one point, a new record for a time at which there was no vugraph. It took us almost 2 years to go from 0 to 1000, 6 months to go from 1000 to 2000, and only 2 months to go from 2000 to 3000. You can help us reach 4000 even more quickly by downloading and installing the ^*Bfree^*N software for ^*BBBO^*N available through:

st||hs|ss|nt|In this week's deal only your side is vulnerable (the vulnerability is shown in the upper left corner above - red is vulnerable and white is not vulnerable). Both East and West are experts. West dealt and passed. Your partner, North, opened 1@C and East made a weak jump overcall of 2@D. You tried 2@S |

sk||hs|ed|nt|If you assume from his 2@D bid that East was dealt a 6-card diamond suit, you know a lot about the distribution of his hand. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|es|hs|ec|at|East was dealt only 3 black cards. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|es|md|0,s5,,c6|hs|ws|at|If all 3 of those cards are clubs, the 5-0 trump break will doom the contract (you can either take my word for it or try to figure this out for yourself). |

md|0,sk9,,cq9|ls|wc|hs|ec|nt|You should therefore focus your attention on East being 1-2 or 2-1 in the black suits. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ec|hs|nd|hs|sc|at|Regardless of what his black suit singleton is, it is a good idea to cash the dummy's @DK for a club discard (West follows with the @D7) |

ls|sh|pc|H9|hs|ws|hs|ns|at|West ruffs small (ruffing with the @SK is obviously fatal) and you win the trick by ruffing with dummy's last trump (too bad if East could overruff with the singleton @SK). |

ls|ns|ls|ws|pc|S2|pc|SQ|pc|D6|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hs|ss|Hs|ws|hs|es|nt|With the lead in the dummy at trick 11, you are guaranteed 2 more trump tricks regardless of the location of the missing spades. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|nd|ls|es|ls|ws|at|Simply ruff one of dummy's minor suit cards in your hand (or overuff if you lead a club and East ruffs in front of you). |

ls|ss|pc|s3|pc|c8|

ls|sh|ls|ns|pc|h7|pc|dj|pc|sj|pc|hq|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hs|es|hs|ws|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|East's singleton club suggests that he started with 2461 distribution. Given that spades are 3-2, it is safe to draw trump as there is no way to lose more than 1 trump trick regardless of the position of the @SK and @S9. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|ls|ws|hs|nc|nt|Note that if you continued as before by ruffing another club in your hand |

ls|ns|ls|sh|ls|wd|ls|nd|pc|h7|pc|dj|pc|sj|pc|hq|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ss|at|Earlier in the analysis I suggested that you should ruff another club at this point, but as ^*BChip Martel^*N pointed out to me, it is far from clear that this is the right way to continue. Can you see why?|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|Ruffing a club now clearly would be right |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|hs|ed|at|if you ^*Iknew^*N that East started with a 6-card diamond suit. While a weak jump overcall of 2@D would normally deliver a 6-card suit, East was at favorable vulnerability and facing a passed partner. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


md|0,d4,,cq|at|For some East's a 5-card diamond suit would be a definite possibility, and there are 2 clues to suggest that this may indeed be the case.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|First, consider West's jump to 4@D. Would you jump to 4@D in this auction with a random 4234 hand? Chip made the point (with which I agree) that most expert Wests would bid only 3@D (or pass) with a hand like that. Second, West discarded a club on the 3rd round of hearts. He probably would have pitched a diamond if he had been dealt a 4234 hand.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|nd|hs|ss|hs|wd|nt|It would be nice to be at the table and to know something about the habits of your opponents, but I think there is a good case to be made that West is likely to have a diamond left (the carefully concealed @D4) in the above position. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|In the actual layout you had to ruff a diamond at this point to make 6@S |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|wd|hs|nc|Hs|ws|at|- an attempt to ruff a club would lead to 2 trump tricks for the defense.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |
