^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 385 - January 26, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both of these deals were sent to me by e-mail. This week's first deal is a lovely play problem that was sent to me by ^*BPiotr Klimowicz^*N (originally from Poland, but now one of Canada's leading players). This week's second deal was sent to me by ^*BPhil Clayton^*N and features ^*BDr. George Fisher^*N in action on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). Both Phil and George are fine players from the USA who can often be found playing on our ^*Bfree^*N online bridge site.

If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appear as ^*BThe Deal of The Week^*N, please e-mail me the details. My e-mail address is:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N }
^-
There are a lot more interesting bridge deals than there are weeks so I cannot use all of the deals that I am sent. I can promise you that I carefully consider every deal that I receive for inclusion in this feature and select only the deals that I think my readers will enjoy the most.

at|West's opening lead is the @S10. Your mission is to find a 100% line to make your contract under the assumption that neither defender has a singleton or void in any suit. See if you can successfully complete your mission before reading on. |

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|sh|nt|^*BPiotr Klimowicz^*N found an elegant line of play that lands the contract regardless of the layout of the missing cards (under the assumption that neither defender has a singleton or void in any suit). His line starts with winning the first trick with the dummy's @SK, |

pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ec|hs|nd|at|Obviously a diamond return into the @DAJ is not a good idea (good move cashing the @DK!). |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|nd|hS|ec|hs|ss|at|You could ruff the @CA return (setting up dummy's @CK) and, if East returns a low club, |

up|39|ls|sh|nt|The solution to this problem is not complex from a technical point of view (at least compared to most other ^*BDeals of the Week^*N), but the solution is counterintuitive for some reason. Try giving this problem to an expert player you know. I bet he or she will have a harder time with it than you might expect!|

sk|s|nt|The hero of this week's second deal (which has been rotated to make South the declarer) is ^*BDr. George Fisher^*N (^*Bdocgf^*N on ^*BBBO^*N). As you can see, George was dealt a super-nice hand - a tribute to the ^*BBBO^*N random deal generator. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |

nt|I won't go into the details of the auction, but George ended up as the declarer in 6@D. The opponents were silent throughout until East doubled the final contract. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


pc|C7|hs|ns|Hs|ss|at|West's opening lead was the @C7. Apparently East's double had been been asking for a spade lead and West didn't read it that way. These things happen in pickup games of bridge on the Internet. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|Even after a spade opening lead, 6@D is a good contract. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nc|at|With a club lead, however, it is very close to being laydown. Fortunately George took a minute and asked himself what could go wrong. You should do the same. Think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before reading on.|

hs|nc|hs|sd|at|and, taking the @SK at face value (usually a good idea in the world of online bridge), George ruffed a club back to his hand (choosing the @CQ for style points). |
