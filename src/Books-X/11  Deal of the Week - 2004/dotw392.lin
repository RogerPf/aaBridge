^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 392 - March 15, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I was the declarer when this week's deal took place on Saturday on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). I was played with my wife, ^*BSheri Winestock^*N, against ^*BBill Gates^*N and ^*BSharon Osberg^*N when this week's deal was played.

On March 23 the Finals of the ^*BInternational Festival of Bridge^*N will be broadcast as ^*Blive^*N vugraph through ^*BBBO^*N. Then on March 27, the Finals of the ^*BVanderbilt Teams^*N will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N from the ^*BACBL Spring NABC^*N in Reno, Nevada. For approximate session starting times visit:

Access to all of our ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcasts is ^*B100% free^*N. There is only one catch - in order to view these broadcasts you must download and install the ^*BBBO^*N software. That's not much of a catch, however, as the ^*BBBO^*N software itself is ^*B100% free^*N. Download the ^*BBBO^*N software through:

If you appreciate ^*Bfree^*N online bridge services and content like ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, ^*BBBO^*N, and our ^*Blive^*N online vugraph broadcasts, you can help our efforts by seeking out a corporate sponsor who will put up the $5000 we need to produce a ^*Blive^*N broadcast of all 15 days of the upcoming ^*BEuropean Championships^*N. We can show our sponsor's logo to a ^*Blot^*N of grateful bridge players! If you think you might be interested, please e-mail me: ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N

I opened the South hand with a 14+ to 17 1NT and ended up in 4@S after a Stayman sequence (no making fun of my trump holding please). |

nt|While there are layouts in which West has 4 spades and the contract can be made, a 4-1 trump break was not my main concern. Even with trumps 3-2 I would have 2 losers in the suit. |

ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|it appeared that the contract would hinge on my ability to play the club suit without losing a trick. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|So I asked myself: "Suppose there is no way to play the club suit without loss. Is there any other chance to make the contract?". I answered to myself: "Yes". Can you see what I was talking to myself about?

ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|The conversation I had with myself was about avoiding a heart loser. I got lucky with the layout of the cards that existed and was able to do just that. Here's how: I won the first trick in my hand with the @HA |
