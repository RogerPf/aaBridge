^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 389 - February 23, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

Apparently there is now something called "print on demand technology" which makes it economical for book publishers to produce small runs of out of print or hard to get books. Good news for bridge players is that a company named ^*BVivisphere^*N has taken advantage of this technology (and that the technology produces high quality books). Good news for Fred is that Vivisphere sent me free copies of several of their books in the hope that I would write a review in this feature. Good news for Vivisphere is that this plan worked (and thanks for the books)!

No doubt you have figured out that I like declarer play problems. 2 of the books I was sent are among my all time favorite collections of these problems. These books are ^*ITest Your Play as Declarer Volumes 1 & 2^*N by ^*BPaul Lukacs^*N and ^*BJeff Rubens^*N. 

The level of difficulty of the problems (89 in Volume 1 and 100 in Volume 2) in these books ranges from advanced to near-impossible. There are some squeezes and endplays, of course, but there are more problems in which counterintuitive timing or the unusual management of a key suit is required in order to find the solution.

I remember reading these books for the first time as a young bridge player and staring for hours at many problems that looked impossible to solve. Lukacs and Rubens helped to teach me to think in the manner a bridge player needs to be able to think. Their solutions are clear, concise, and completely logical. The depth of their analysis is most impressive. If you like play problems, it doesn't get much better than this.

Here's a hint (you don't get one in the book): There is a line of play that guarantees the contract as long as diamonds are no worse than 3-1. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ed|sk||nt|Thanks to my generous hint, you should know that it would be wrong play diamonds from the top. If you did so then you would almost certainly go down if one of the defenders was dealt 3 diamonds to the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|The correct way to play that diamond suit is from the bottom, not from the top. Watch what happens if you lead the @D3 to dummy's @DJ. |

In this week's 2nd deal you are the declarer in 6@S (I don't like the bidding much either, but it doesn't matter - this is a declarer play problem). |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||ls|Ss|
pc|CQ|hs|ns|Hs|ss|at|West's opening lead is the @CQ and it appears that it would take a lot of bad luck to go down in this slam. If East has all 4 spades you will go down. It looks like you can afford to lose 1 trump trick |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


hs|sd|ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|as the hearts can be used to eventually provide a discard for your @DQ. |

pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|I believe that, at the table, just about every bridge player in the world would play a trump to the dummy. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|S3|pc|S2|pc|SA|pc|C5|at|East discards a club. What would you do now? |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|The correct play from here is to try to cross back to the @HQ in order to take a trump finesse (planning to later use the @DA as an entry for another finesse). |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |

at|You find out that you shouldn't have woken up today when West ruffs your @HQ. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


mc|11|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|As there is still a certain heart loser, there is no way to make the contract from here. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|up|4|sk||hs|nd|Hs|sd|hs|ed|at|Note that East was dealt the @DK (it's only fair that something worked) so it was possible to make 6@S by returning to your hand with a diamond finesse (instead of with a heart to the @HQ). |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|The question is: how could you have known that it was right to take the diamond finesse? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


up|4|ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|ed|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|The way you could have known was by making the far from obvious play of leading a heart instead of a trump at trick 2. As you will see, this play (which is almost without risk) will result in the declarer knowing that he needs the diamond finesse before it's too late.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |

hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|ws|at|You should then continue with a heart to your @HQ and the worst thing that could happen is that West might ruff. |

ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|ws|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hq|pc|s7|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |

hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|nt|Now let's consider what happens when East is the one with all 4 hearts. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hs|ws|ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|eh|at|Except for some very obscure layouts that are all but impossible given the East-West silence, it can never help West to ruff what is essentially his partner's natural heart trick. |

ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|ws|hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|at|Since there is a certain heart loser, |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|eh|hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|ws|at|you cannot afford a trump loser. That means that you will have to get to your hand to take 2 trump finesses. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|ws|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|That means you need the diamond finesse to work. |
