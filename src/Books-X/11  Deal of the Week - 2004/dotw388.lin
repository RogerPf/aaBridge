^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 388 - February 16, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals are declarer play problems and both are easier than most of the problems that appear in this feature. I like these two deals because their respective solutions are both unintuitive (to me at least ) and relatively simple.

This week's first deal was sent to me by ^*BAndy Stark^*N, a fine player from my ex-home city of Toronto. This week's second deal was played a couple of weeks ago on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N ^*BBBO^*N), the ^*Bfree^*N online bridge service that was developed by my company.

If you happened to be logged in to ^*BBBO^*N yesterday at about 4PM EST, you might have noticed that more than 3,300 other people were logged in at the same time. Thanks for helping to set another attendance record. Actually an attendance record is set on most Sunday afternoons, but the "real record" was over 5,400. That happened during our live vugraph broadcast of last year's World Championships. Yesterday's record was a "non-vugraph record".

Our next live vugraph broadcast rates to be a good one. On February 28-29 we will be broadcasting 16 short team matches live from the ^*BWhite House Invitational^*N in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Commentary and analysis from some of the world's leading players will be available. Many fierce Dutch teams and dozens of international stars will be playing in this tournament. The bridge rates to be great - don't miss our vugraph show!

I am also pleased to announce that the qualifying round of the ^*B2004 North American College Bridge Team Championships^*N will be played on February 28 on ^*BBBO^*N. This is not really a vugraph show (as the players themselves will be using ^*BBBO^*N to facilitate the tournament), but spectators are welcome. My thanks go out to the ^*BACBL^*N for making this possible.

If you are a student at a North American college, it is not too late to enter a team from your school into this event! For more information visit:

hc|sakjhqdqcj|at|West's opening lead is a 4th best @S2 and your partner's dummy contains a lot of HCP - it would be a shame to go down... Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |

ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|and a diamond suit that is certain to produce at least 2 more tricks, it would be easy to get careless on this deal. In fact, that is exactly what happened to both of the experts who played this deal in a recent team match. |

pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|wc|mc|8|at|The declarers who played this hand were not very lucky, but they were not very skillful either. Do you see how they could have played to guarantee 9 tricks?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


up|12|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|Not surprisingly, the key to this problem is in the proper handling of the diamond suit. All that really matters is that you play the @DK or the @DQ on the first round of the suit. Your best play in terms of overtricks is to start by leading the @D5 to dummy's @DQ, but in terms of making the contract, leading the first diamond from the dummy is just fine. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|d2|pc|d3|hs|sd|nt|Finessing the @D10, however, is a mistake. The declarers should have played the @DK from their hands. |

hs|sh|nt|In this week's second deal, your partner opens 1@D as North, East overcalls 4@C and your 4@H bid ends the auction. You definitely have a little something in reserve for your bidding here. It would be a shame to go down...|

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|you astutely note that the only way to go down in 4@H is to lose 2 trump tricks. Leading the @HA on the first round is out of the question - that would result in immediate defeat if West was dealt all 5 missing trumps (which is not that unlikely given that clubs are 8-1). |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|It therefore seems right to play a heart to the dummy's @HK. What could go wrong from there? |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |

sk||mc|9|nt|It was unlucky that East was dealt a 0238 hand, the only distribution that this line fails against, but the declarer should have prevailed. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


up|12|hs|nh|hs|Sh|

nt|No, it would not have been correct to lay down the @HA at trick 4. That play would have worked against the actual layout, |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


md|0,ht5,,s43|hs|wh|at|but it would have failed in the more likely event that West was dealt a hand with 5 hearts. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


md|0,s34,,ht5|ls|wh|ls|sh|ls|nh|hs|nd|hs|sd|up|3|nt|The critical play came a trick earlier, when East returned a diamond (diamonds sure are a tricky suit this week!). The declarer should have played the @DQ from his hand and overtaken with the @DK in the dummy. |
