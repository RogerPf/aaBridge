bjacobs: Oh you don't want to take any notice of my bidding David? :)
jtr: Lol. If you have led a trump we might have beaten this :). We do quite well in @ds. I might have raised if Jon had bid 3@c.

jtr: When do we lead K and when A from AK, Bill?
bjacobs: Suggest king for count, ace for attitude?
jtr: Suits me.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|Q: If N opens 3@c will N/S reach 5@c?
Walddk2: I don't think so. This hand is too good for a pre-empt. Jon would not expect this much if I opened 3@C.
jbgood: Right, Roland.
bjacobs: I agree - too good for 3@C. Perhaps if Roland was vulnerable, then 3@C?
Walddk2: Yes, vulnerability matters. But Jon still needs me to have a side king.
jbgood: Still too good in my opinion.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|Q: Do you ever use the rule of 20 on a hand like this?
Walddk2: I often use the Rule of 20. And my hand did match that rule.

jtr: What are our 2 openings Bill? Weak except 2@c?
bjacobs: OK, fine.|

nt|bjacobs: Since Roland has come in vulnerable versus not, I know he has a good hand... particularly as there are only 5 hearts in it. I'm definitely hoping he has the @cK.
jtr: @hK lead would have worked better. He could switch then to a @d.
Walddk2: I know Jon has 3 cards, as we lead 3rd from 3. So Bill has a singleton. This may be difficult to beat now because I think Bill has very good spades. I have a feeling that a diamond lead was needed to beat it, but I am not sure. The best I can do is to play a another heart and let Bill ruff.|
pc|H6|pc|C3|pc|H7|pc|H4|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|Walddk2: I think Bill can get rid of at least 3 diamonds on good spades. If he has @CAJx, he may ruff a spade now and finesse trumps.
jbgood: Seems as a trump lead might have been better - but I always try to find a reason not to :).
bjacobs: I have some choices here ... I could ruff a spade and take the club finesse. Or I could start playing spades from the top, hoping to discard 3 or 4 diamonds.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|jtr: Ruff a @s low and finesse @cs looks normal to me. But it is easy seeing all four hands. Roland will have a good hand entering at this vulnerability and it looks like South has the @hK.
bjacobs: Let's see, if I play spades from the top, and Roland ruffs the 4th one, then I still might need to take a club finesse for the contract.

nt|Walddk2: Took a diamond lead to beat it, not easy. @HK would also defeat it. Then Jon can switch to a diamond knowing that there is no more hearts to cash.
jbgood: Right Roland - sloppy lead.
bjacobs: What do you think of my line?  Should I have alternatively ruffed a spade and tried the club finesse?
jtr: I said ruff a @s but I think your line is better.
Walddk2: I predicted that you would ruff a spade and take a club finesse
bjacobs: I guess the important point was to think through the possibilities in the playing.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|Q: Why not lead a trump, please?
jtr: He knows we have loads of tricks so a trump is pointless.
bjacobs: I don't like trump leads :). Think of it this way... trump leads have a tendency to do declarer's work... so only make them if you have good reason.
jbgood: I always try to find an alternative - this time suit was right - but not the card :).|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|Walddk2: Trump lead would not have mattered here. It takes a diamond lead, or @HK and a diamond switch, which is easy to find when @HK holds.
jtr: Notice that Roland can play the @hQ under the @hK asking for a @d switch.
Walddk2: Jon knows my heart length so there is no need to give attitude. Now suit preference is paramount.|

sk|N|at|Walddk2: This is a danger hand. Always be watchful when you are void in partner's long suit. I will bid a forcing 1NT (we play 2/1), which denies heart support and four spades.
|mb|1n!|an|Forcing, not 4 @ss, can have 3 @hs|

|mb|p|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


sk|S|at|jbgood: 1 NT forcing in 2/1 - but also denies 4 card spades. So that suit is not biddable for me - if I bid 2 spades it would show a much stronger hand.

sk|W|mb|p|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


sk|N|nt|Walddk2: This is interesting. I know many inexperienced players will bid again with my hand because they try to improve the contract. But that would be wrong. With a misfit, get out of it as quickly as possible and pass. I know E-W have more trumps than us, but that can't be helped. It would be nice if 2NT by me now would ask Jon to choose between the minors, but it does not. It it natural, good hand. And we may not even have a minor fit. Jon could be 3=6=2=2 or even 4=5=2=2.

nt|Q: Why not @s10 before going back on the hand?
jbgood: Either the spades are 3-3 or the @s10 would be ruffed.

Q: What about answer 2@c over 1 NT?
Walddk2: I can't bid 2@C because that would be game forcing in our system, and I am not strong enough for that. So I must temporise with a forcing 1NT. In SAYC I could bid 2@C.
Q: I asked about Jon's answer.
jbgood: Yes, I could have 2@C in response to 1NT but my hearts were too many and too good.|

nt|Q: What is 1NT range in your system?
Walddk2: 6 to a bad 12. 6-11 normally.

pg| ***** 120 ***** |


sk|N|at|Walddk2: This is a borderline hand; should one overcall 2@C or not? I would have liked at least @C10, but you got to bid the hand you are dealt. It's an absolute minimum for 2@C. I am not proud of it, and pass is certainly an attractive alternative.
|mb|2c|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


sk|E|at|bjacobs: My hand is perfect for playing inverted minors.  The raise to 2@D shows 10+ and is forcing, the jump raise to 3@D is a preemptive raise. But that's all irrelevant after the 2@C bid. My immediate reaction to this bid is that we are either going to play 2@C doubled, or 3NT. Some people would play my pass as forcing here, waiting for the re-opening double, but that is not standard. So how big a risk is the pass? Too risky for me ... and 3@C might not go that much down, so ...|

sb|W|sb|S|
sk|N|at|Walddk2: I think Jon is trying to show both majors. The only way he can do that is by cue bidding David's suit. So I will oblige and give preference. Jon should have some tolerance for clubs too. If I don't have a 4-card major, he must be prepared for a pull to 5@C. That's why I think he has some club support.|mb|4s|

at|jbgood: 3NT would have been down - but there might have been games on both sides here. I did expect partner to have a bit more bidding vulnerable. And the heart finesse not working - he will go down?
Walddk2: This could be expensive. I know I have 3 certain losers: 1 diamond, 1 spade, and 1 club because I know @CK is with Bill after his 3NT call. I have problems in hearts and spades too. May lose to @HK and another spade.
|pc|D7|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


at|jtr: I can play a low @d for a @c ruff but I think that would make life easier for declarer. It might have helped to show my length there, but with a singleton in dummy, suit preference is the norm.
|pc|DJ|pc|D3|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt|bjacobs: Well that @DJ seems like a signal for hearts? But I think hearts can wait (I hope!)

|
pc|C2|pc|D9|
at|jtr: No point in ruffing. Partner has some @cs for his 3NT bid and I don't want to shorten my trumps.

|pc|CA|pc|C4|
at|bjacobs: This is where you have to work out declarer's shape. 4=2=1=6? Of course you guys know - but the point of defence is to work these things out. That gives David 3=4=6=0. Now the points... David has ??? (something) - KJ10x - AJ10xxx - void.

nt|jtr: @h5, Bill? Didn't matter at that stage anyway.
bjacobs: That was also a mistake David ... I was trying to fool declarer, but more likely to be fooling you.
jtr: I missed the second @d.
bjacobs: I figure if you go wrong on a hand, you might as well be consistent and continue with the errors.
jtr: If I double 4@d what would that mean to you?
bjacobs: I think offering 5@D. Which might just have made?
jtr: Maybe I should then. I thought it might show defence. I would probably have bid 5@d. 4@s might even make from my hand if you dont want to double it.
|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|bjacobs: Still your hand was pretty, um, crap.
jtr: Pas devant les enfants (Not in front of the children) :)
bjacobs: Actually, that's one of the reasons I doubled 4@S ... otherwise David might think I was psyching, and pass it out.
jtr: Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a bid is a psyche :)
bjacobs: Well, 3NT can sort of be tactical, with a bunch of diamonds... not exactly an out-and-out psyche. I wouldn't do a total psyche in real life, let alone in this forum.
jbgood: Good point Bill - but you should have told me earlier!|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt|BILMANAGER: Oh guys I should have told you no psyching in the BIL. We have to learn to play what we have before we start pretending :).
Walddk2: I was very light for my overcall and I told specs. I am not proud of it.
I don't think they can make 3NT, but I understand Jon's action.
jbgood: And as I told the kibs - Bill might have pulled our leg with his 3 NT - and I stated that I prefer to trust my partner rather than the opps.
Walddk2: Good idea.... unless you play with me :).|

pg| ***** 164 ***** |


sk|E|nt|bjacobs: 1NT has to be a natural sort of bid I suppose... he could double 1@S for takeout of spades. Should I go to 2@D? Think I won't risk the misunderstanding, even if 2@D should be natural.

sk|N|nt|Walddk2: Choice of leads here. Must be a spade or a heart. You do not touch diamonds from that holding. I can lead @SQ to set up my suit (hopefully), or I could try to hit Jon with a heart (the queen). Not much in it, so I will go for a heart. The advantage of not leading a spade is that it will prevent David to score the king if he has it.
jbgood: Roland knows I am poor in strength. And probably also in @ds :). He might deduct that I have 5 clubs and lead a small from 3. I have typically shown 3 spades, 4(+) hearts and no @d support.
|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


sk|W|at|jtr: Might be right to duck here to cut communications. But if Roland has the @h8 I have a second stop through dummy's holding. Plus I don't really want a @s switch.|

pc|D7|at|Walddk2: Looks like Jon's @D9 was a singleton, although conceivably it could be from 2.  But the fact that David plays another diamond indicates that he has 3 of them, so I can't rise with the ace now. Also, I think Jon has 5 clubs which leaves him with a 3-4-1-5 shape (he showed an odd number of clubs when he followed to the first one).

at|BILMANAGER: 1NT are a BILlies nightmare. Questions?
Q: I don't understand why West didn't bid 1NT instead of pass. Even without a @d stopper, you have the points and the distribuiton. I'm sorry, I feel you gave your partner and the opps misinformation. I've been to 1NT "boot camp" :).
jtr: I could have bid it over 1@h maybe because I am not really showing such a good hand on the second round.
Walddk2: Oh, a sandwich 1NT.
jbgood: No sandwich Roland - I have fresh crabs here on my island!
Walddk2: lol
jtr: I would have been too tired to play it.|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


nt|Q: Please explain 8@c showing odd number?
Walddk2: It doesn't in our methods. But I guess Jon just wanted to cover the 7. I usually play upside-down count, but with Jon I play standard. So technically, the 3 would have been the card.
jbgood: Why is that Roland? I have been playing upside down for 30 years!
bjacobs: You should come Down Under then!
Walddk2: OK then, thought we agreed Norwegian. I am happy with UDCA. So let's play that from now on.|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


nt|Walddk2: Experts are flexible and can play most any methods. It takes a few compromises to agree a system. The important issue is that you both play what you are comfortable with. 
jbgood: Not to mention: the same system :).
Walddk2: And sometimes one has to accept that you can't get all you want, hence the compromises.|

bjacobs: It's a good question... 12 opposite 11. But both hands were rich in aces and kings. Now put the @H10 in my hand, and 4@H probably comes home.
jtr: I did well not to overcall 1@s after all. Bill might have been silly enough to lead one. Although Jon probably plays the hand.
bjacobs: As it turned out, my @C lead was a good one.  The realistic alternative, @SJ, would probably have let Roland home.
jtr: For sure it would. If I can't bid 1@s though little point in attacking there.|

nt|Walddk2: Interesting. Not my unblock, that is routine for experts.
bjacobs: Should I have just bid 4 of a minor, do you think?  Of course, on the whole layout, the answer is yes.
jtr: I might have just bid 5@c but 9 tricks is easier.
bjacobs: You had every right to check for a spade stopper.
jtr: Only because of the 2 Aces did I do it.
bjacobs: I didn't actually have one... although often the defence goes wrong. Not today, though.
jtr: It looks like they only have 8 @ss between them and I could have Jxx. Even 10xx might be enough.
|
pg| ***** 259 ***** |


nt|jbgood: The point of this hand is to lead the king - a small one would see him home and the king doesn't lose anything - you can play a small later and be sure partner has 3
Walddk2: Another point. Asking for count against NT when you lead a top honour. Some do it with the king, others with the ace. It's important for Jon to know how many spades I have. Then he can figure out the rest. I think many inexperienced players would only score 4 spade tricks either by leading a low spade (then they won't get 4) or by forgetting to unblock.
bjacobs: Yes, a nice combination of the good lead and the unblock.|
pg| ***** 260 ***** |


nt|Q: Please, was West showing a half stopper when he bid 3@s?
bjacobs: Not really.
jtr: No, I didn't pormise a half stop but may well have one.
bjacobs: Of course I was hoping he had @Jxx as I think I commented when bidding 3NT.
jbgood: 5 of any minor is on though.
bjacobs: With diamonds coming in, that's true.  But I don't feel bad about our auction... Next time David will be @SJxx-@Hxx-@DAxxx-@CAxxx, and 3NT is the right spot.|
nt|jtr: Yes, you might be able to judge how to play the @ds in NT.
bjacobs: Don't need the diamonds if I get a spade trick.
jtr: Same is true in @cs but that needs them to break 3-2.
bjacobs: Assuming I can get 4 club tricks.
jtr: Ah true.|

at|Walddk2: Our top spot is 3@C. Perhaps Jon should have signed off in 3@C over 2NT, but he hoped for a club honour in my hand. The king rather than the queen. Even as it is, it would make if Bill had the king double or triple. So one should not be too downhearted to be in 3NT and go off. If you never go down, you don't play enough :).
