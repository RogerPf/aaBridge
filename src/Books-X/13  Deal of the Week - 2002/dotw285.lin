^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 285 - February 25, 2002^*N 
 ^*BIOC Grand Prix Edition Number 3^*N 
 ^*BThe Canada-Italy Semi-Final^*N }
^-
This week's deal is the third part of my continuing account of the recent ^*BIOC Grand Prix^*N in Salt Lake City. If you have not done so already, I suggest that you read parts 1 and 2 of this series, available as ^*BDeals of the Week 283^*N and ^*B284^*N (February 11 and 18, 2002) through this web site. 

I hope you enjoy this week's deals!

My Canadian Team (partner ^*BJoey Silver^*N and ^*BNick Gartaganis-Peter Jones^*N, ^*BKeith Balcombe^*N-^*BGord Campbell^*N) had unexpectedly finished 4th out of 10 strong teams after the robin robin phase of the 2002 IOC Grand Prix. We had thereby qualified for the semi-finals and would face Italy over 48 boards. The winner of this match would play the winner of the Norway-Poland semi-final for the Gold Medal. There were plenty of people betting on Italy, Norway, and Poland at this point. Nobody was betting on Canada, not even ^*BGeorge Mittelman^*N.

Our team had done well to get this far, but we were about to play a lot of boards against some of the best players in the world. Italy would enjoy a 6 IMP carryover (as they had demolished our team when we met in the round robin), but most people did not think they would need it.

The only good news about the Italian team was that one of their key players, ^*BNorberto Bocchi^*N was not playing. His regular partner, ^*BGiorgio Duboin^*N would play with ^*BGuido Ferraro^*N, while ^*BAlfredo Versace^*N would play with both ^*BLorenzo Lauria^*N (his regular partner) and ^*BDano de Falco^*N. Although Italy was not quite at full strength, they still had 5 A-1 players on their team and one of the world's best partnerships in ^*BLauria^*N-^*BVersace^*N.

The first quarter went pretty much according to form. Italy played well, Canada made a couple of mistakes, and Italy won the 12-board quarter 43-12. Including carryover our team was down by 37. Yuck! Peter and Nick had performed well on vugraph (their first time) until the last board when they misdefended a vulnerable game. Canada lost 2 other big swings as well in the first quarter. Here are the deals...

hs|sh|nt|
On this deal I was South and only the opponents were vulnerable. East, Giorgio Duboin, dealt and opened 1@C and I had to decide whether or not to overcall 1@H.

|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


lb|*MDid Fred overcall?^Yes~No^1|
mb|1H|
nt|I overcalled 1@H. I wish I could think of some way to justify this action other than by saying that this sort of thing seems to work. I had an indifferent suit, soft values, and no distributional surprises. All in all I had a really awful hand, but favorable vulnerability is a license to take certain liberties. Alfredo Versace also overcalled 1@H with my cards at the other table.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|D|an|Denies 4 spades|mb|2S|an|Fit-showing|

ls|sh|hs|ss|nt|Guido made a negative double which, according to the Italian style, denied as many as 4 spades (he would have bid 1@S if he held 4 or more cards in that suit). Joey jumped to 2@S - a ^*Bfit-showing jump^*N that suggested 5+ spades, 4+ hearts, and at least limit raise values. We had a double fit and, at this point, it felt like my 1@H overcall was going to work out just fine.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|I don't normally use fit-showing jumps or even claim to understand them, but Joey really likes to play this treatment. All of our jump shifts in competition are fit-showing (except jumps to 4 of a major). As you will see, there were several deals (including this one) in which our use of fit-showing jumps generated a lot of IMPs (not always for our team).|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|4D|mb|?|

ls|ss|nt|Of course, when your side has a big double fit, the opponents usually do as well. Giorgio jumped to 4@D, a forcing bid that suggested a powerful minor 2-suiter. It was my turn to call. What would you do with my cards?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^4S|
mb|4S|
hs|ss|nt|I chose to bid 4@S. It was ^*Bhighly^*N unlikely that we could make this contract, but I "knew" that the opponents had a vulnerable game in one of the minors and that 4@S would not be very expensive. Also, I expected more bidding and wanted to let Joey know about our double fit. I also wanted to take away Guido's ability to cuebid 4 of a major.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|4N|mb|5H|mb|P|mb|p|ls|ss|

nt|Guido bid 4NT, presumably as a slam try in one (or both) of the minors, and Joey competed to 5@H. Giorgio's pass was forcing. I also passed. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


mb|6C|mb|P|mb|P|mb|?|
at|Guido now bid 6@C which was passed around to me. What call would you make on my cards?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^6H|

hs|Sh|mb|6H|mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|I chose to sacrifice in 6@H. Guido doubled and 6@H doubled was the final contract. It took me about 10 minutes to bid 6@H and I am quite sure this was by the most thought (at least in terms of time) that I gave any problem during this tournament.|

nt|I thought that I knew within a card or 2 what everyone's distribution was. I thought about various layouts and how many tricks each side could win. I thought that we probably had a major suit winner and that the deal would probably hinge on my @DQ. If the dummy had 2 or 4 diamonds then 6@C would make, but what if dummy had exactly 3 diamonds? Would Giorgio guess my @DQ?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|I eventually decided that I could not afford to take the chance that 6@C would be making (especially since my ridiculously long trance had probably tipped off the location of the @DQ). I considered a fancy 6@D bid to get Joey to pick between the majors, but figuring that I had already shown 4-card spade support, I opted for a simple 6@H.|

nt|Well we came close to achieving par on this deal (par is 6@S doubled, down only -500 as the defense cannot get a ruff), but I did not like our result very much. It was possible that Nick and Peter might bid and make 6@C, but they might also go down in that contract. There were an awful lot of IMPs riding on the position of the @DQ here!|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sd|hs|ed|hs|wd|nt|At the other table Nick and Peter did get to 6@C and Nick had to guess the @DQ in order to make his contract. The opponents had been much less active in the bidding, but Nick was still able to get a count on the hand. Once he figured out that North had been dealt 3 diamonds, he naturally played North for the @DQ.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|So Nick went down in 6@C and Canada lost 14 IMPs. If he had decided to go anti-percentage in diamonds for some reason then Canada would have won 11 IMPs instead! Yes, sometimes bridge can be very random and seem very unfair!|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |

nt|Then there was this wild deal. Joey and I defended 5@D doubled by Guido and, when Joey led a heart (the suit that I had opened), the contract could not be defeated despite the 5-0 trump split. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|wd|hs|ec|hs|wc|at|At the other table Nick and Peter played 5@C doubled. They had found a more solid trump fit, but their contract went down after Versace, South, led 2 rounds of hearts. |

nt|At the other table the declarer for Italy played West for the @DQ early in the play and wound up with 9 tricks. Canada lost 12 IMPs on this deal where we would have gained 12 IMPs had the @DQ been with East. Between this and the first quarter deal in which we had lost 14 IMPs where we might have gained 11, it was starting to look like the @DQ might be Canada's bane!|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|wd|ls|nd|ls|sd|

bt||nt|
Our team played pretty well in the second quarter and ended up losing 5 more IMPs on those 12 boards (34-29). That was much better than the first quarter, but we were now down 42 IMPs with only 24 boards to go. It was natural to think, "Well at least we didn't get blown out again," but thinking like that is thinking about losing. The right attitude is, "We are underdogs and we are losing, but we can beat these guys!" We could not afford to be realistic.

Nick Gartaganis, our captain, made a smart decision when he chose to sit Joey and I out for the 3rd quarter. On the first board Canada lost 10 IMPs and the margin stood at 52 IMPs. During the remaining 11 boards, however, Canada did not lose another IMP and we scored 34 IMPs at the same time. All of a sudden we were in the match again. Italy's lead was down to just 18 IMPs and there were still 12 boards to play!

Nick now had a tough decision to make. The rest of the team had done very well without Joey and me and there was a strong case to be made for sitting us out again. Nick eventually chose to play Joey and me along with Keith and Gord while he and Peter sat out. I believe that Nick reasoned that having his most experienced pair playing at crunch time was more important than what just happened in the previous quarter. I was very happy that I would get a chance to play the last quarter, but I certainly would have respected Nick's decision had he chose to sit me out again.

It turns out that the WBF's deal generation software did an amazing job when it created the 12 boards for the fourth quarter. Almost every one of the these deals was exciting and contained scope for large numbers of IMPs to be swung. As you will see, Joey and I had a ^*Blot^*N of big hands in our direction. I am going to show you all 12 of these deals now, but I won't include too much in the way of details or analysis on most of these.

hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|Something good happened on the very first deal of the last quarter. 3NT on the North-South cards will certainly fail a lot of the time, but you just have to be there vulnerable at IMPs. It looks to me that Giorgio and Guido had some kind of a bidding misunderstanding to get to only 2@D. Guido made 2@D exactly for +90.|

ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|es|hs|ws|hs|ns|nt|I knew that Gord and Keith would find their way to 3NT with the North-South cards and that they would make that contract (as the normal play of the @S10 on the first or second round of the suit would work on the actual lie of the cards). Keith's 1NT rebid (instead of Giorgio's choice of 1@H) led to a much easier auction. Keith played carefully for +600 in 3NT. 11 IMPs to Canada.|

ls|es|ls|ws|ls|ns|nt|Although I generally do not keep score when I play bridge I do try to be aware of the score. It is rare for me to take an action based on my estimate of the state of the match, but there are times when I will do this. I mentally chocked up the 11 IMPs that we actually won on this deal and thought (correctly as it turned out) that we were now down only 7 IMPs.|

hs|es|hs|ws|nt|The second board was another possible plus position for our side. Joey and I had bought the hand for 3@S, down 1 in top tricks for -50. Meanwhile, North-South could make 4@H or 5@C on the actual lie of the cards. I didn't ^*Iexpect^*N Keith and Gord to get to game on these cards, but I thought it was possible. It was also possible that the Italian East-West pair would play 4@S doubled for -300.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|There are a few interesting points about the bidding. First, notice that I passed in third position. I would have opened 2@S with some partners, but not with Joey. At the other table Alfredo opened 1@S with my hand. What you choose to do with the West cards is really a matter of style and partnership. Note also Joey's decision to overcall 1@S on a 4-card suit.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|Finally note my 3@S bid. Joey and I play 3@S here as a "preemptive raise" and my hand was atypically strong for this action. My first instinct was to bid 4@S, but I expected that the opponents would just double us and collect a reasonable penalty (I was right about that I think). The reason I felt comfortable about bidding 3@S on this hand was a function of partnership philosophy. |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|A lot of pairs make preemptive jump raises on nearly worthless hands. Joey and I do not play that way. When we make a preemptive jump raise, it is more of an invitation for partner to sacrifice (as opposed to a purely obstructive bid). In the context of the auction (none vulnerable with Joey and I both being passed hands), I felt that an "invitation to sacrifice" was what my hand was worth.|

nt|At the other table Alfredo's 1@S opening with my cards made it very difficult for North-South to get to game. The Italians also played 3@S on this deal and lost the same 5 tricks to push the board at -50. Note that both my pass and Alfredo's 1@S as West worked out well. I don't think that a 2@S opening would have been as successful (East-West would likely play 4@S doubled for -300).|

hs|wh|sk|w|nt|On the third board I was dealt 16 HCP and a nice 6-card heart suit. Guido on my right passed and only the opponents were vulnerable. Think about your bidding plan (it is a good idea to make some plans beyond the opening bid ^*Bnow^*N so that your tempo will be good if partner makes an normal response).|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|?|

nt|I opened 1@H, normally enough, and Joey made the not unexpected response of 1@S. I had already given this matter some consideration and I knew what my rebid was going to be. Does the plan you made cover this scenario?|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


ls|wh|lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^2N|
mb|2N|
nt|I chose to rebid 2NT, showing a good 17 to 19 HCP in our partnership. 3@H is certainly a more mainstream bid, but Joey and I use the 3@H jump rebid here to express extra playing strength, not extra high card values. In a sense 2NT was an overbid, but my whole hand really felt "notrumpy". I actually considered opening the bidding 1NT, but I thought my hand was too good.|

pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|There were no strong clues from the bidding, but I thought of 2 reasons why I should play to dummy's @DK. First, Giorgio had given some thought to balancing when 2@S was passed around to him.

nt|By the way, I did all of this thinking ^*Bbefore^*N I led the @D3 from my hand.

Joey really should never be bidding 3@H here. What was he up to?|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


mb|?|ls|wc|nt|I could think of only 2 things that could have happened. Either Joey had forgotten our fancy convention or he was 3433 and had judged to rebid 2NT instead of raising hearts.

hs|ss|hs|sd|ls|ed|ls|wd|nt|It turned out that Lorenzo had to open the bidding with 2@D on the East hand to show a balanced 17 to 19.

nt|I did not know it at the time, of course, but on this deal (the third last in the match) Canada would take the lead for good. Joey opened 1@S as East and Guido, South, overcalled 4@C. Only our side was vulnerable. What call would you make as West?|

nt|I chose to bid 4@S and did not really consider this much of a problem. Alfredo Versace chose to double with my hand in the same position. In retrospect it is easy to see how double could be the winning action, but bad things also could happen if you start with double. My 4@S call had the advantage of simplicity. As you have seen, Joey and I believe in keeping things simple!|

ls|ws|mb|5C|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|?|
nt|Giorgio bid 5@C, Joey went on to 5@S, and Guido passed. A lot of thoughts went through my head at this point. My first thought was, "don't be tempted - your hand is within your expected range and Joey did not invite you to bid a slam." I thought about what a pass by Joey would mean and on what sort of hand he would bid 5 of a red suit instead of 5@S. I thought and thought and thought.|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


nt|Then I saw the light. This problem was not about what bids "should" mean or what Joey was "showing". Bridge is a game of taking tricks and Joey's 5@S bid had the simple meaning, "I think I can win 11 tricks." If he thought he could win 11 tricks opposite a normal hand, then I thought he could win 12 tricks opposite this hand!|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


hs|ws|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|I therefore bid 6@S which became the final contract. Looking back, my choice to bid 6@S now feels clearly right, but believe me, this was not an easy bid to make in the heat of battle! I knew that 6@S may have had no play and that I might end up looking like a fool and/or losing the match as a result of this call. |
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


nt|In the end ^*BBob Hamman^*N's immortal words inspired me. He once told me, "Son, if you are never willing to put your balls on the table, you are never going to win at this game!"

hs|wc|nt|Now I had a tremendous hand for clubs, but I did not have any easy call. 4NT would be an attempt to signoff for us, not RKCB. 4@H, a cuebid in support of clubs, looked "normal", but I did not like this call.

nt|My thinking was that I was going to drive the hand to at least 6@C regardless of what bid Joey made next. While it was true that 6@C might have no play, I did not have the room I needed to explore scientifically.

I did not know that we had made 6@C, however, until when we were scoring up the match. What a relief to learn that my psych had not cost our team the match! Canada still led by 12 IMPs with 1 board left to play.|

hs|wd|hs|sd|nt|The last board was relatively uneventful. Joey chose to open with a weak 2@D in 3rd seat and all passed. I am glad that I did not raise him to 3@D as even 2@D was far too high given the 5-0 trump break. Joey went down 3 tricks, but we were not doubled so -150 was not a big disaster. |

We compared our results and added up the scores, Canada had defeated Italy by 11 IMPs! Of course, all of the Canadian players and our supporters in Salt Lake City were thrilled by our dramatic come-from-behind upset of arguably the strongest bridge team in the world.

For sure we received some luck toward the end of this match, but luck had gone against us in the first 2 quarters (the 2 huge swings to Italy that depended on the position of the @DQ, for example). But our win did not feel like a fluke - it felt like Canada had deserved to win. We had held the Italians to just 5(!) IMPs over the last 23 boards of the match. All 3 of our partnerships played a key role in Canada's victory. Italy was certainly a better team than Canada, but on this particular day it felt like nobody was going to beat us.

We only needed one more day like that. Things would not get any easier for us on that day. In the final we would face another team, Poland, that is also arguably the strongest bridge team in the world (I prefer to avoid getting into these sorts of arguments -- all of these guys are ^*Bgood^*N). Poland had come from behind in the 4th quarter to defeat Norway 112 IMPs to 89 in the other semi-final match.

Whatever happened against Poland, all of the Canadian players knew that the 2002 IOC Grand Prix would represent a high point in their bridge careers. The Poles were heavy favorites to defeat our team and the pressure was all on them. We had nothing to lose.
