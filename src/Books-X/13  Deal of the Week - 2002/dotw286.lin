^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 286 - March 4, 2002^*N 
 ^*BIOC Grand Prix Edition Number 4^*N 
 ^*BThe Canada-Poland Final^*N }
^-
This week's deal is the fourth part of my continuing account of the recent ^*BIOC Grand Prix^*N in Salt Lake City. If you have not done so already, I suggest that you read parts 1, 2, and 3 of this series, available as ^*BDeals of the Week 283^*N, ^*B284^*N, and ^*B285^*N (February 11, 18, and 25 2002) through this web site. 

I hope you enjoy this week's deals!

Sorry if you are getting tired of hearing that Team Canada (myself and partner ^*BJoey Silver^*N along with ^*BNick Gartaganis^*N-^*BPeter Jones^*N and ^*BKeith Balcombe^*N-^*BGord Campbell^*N) was not expected to do well in the 2002 IOC Grand Prix, but it really was the case. If our success in this event had not been so surprising I would not be writing such a detailed account of my experiences.

Nobody expected us to finish in the top 4 (of 10) teams in the round robin. Nobody expected us to defeat the World Champion Italian Team in the semi-finals and nobody expected us to defeat Poland in the finals.

The Polish team that we would face in the final was clearly one of the very best and most successful teams in the world today. Poland was able to field 2 of the strongest partnerships on the planet in ^*BCesary Balicki^*N-^*BAdam Zmudzinski^*N and ^*BMichal Kwiecien^*N-^*BJacek Pszczola^*N. It turned out that Poland's third pair, ^*BJacek Poletylo^*N-^*BMarek Wojcicki^*N, would see no action in the 48-board final.

Meanwhile, most of the players on Canada's team had very little international experience. Most people considered it a miracle that our team had made it this far. This factor made our success more enjoyable for me. Doing well when you are one of the favorite teams is nice, of course, but being part of a Cinderella story is much more fun! 

On top of that, Joey and I had become good friends with our teammates (who we did not know very well before this event started). They were a great bunch of guys and I knew that this experience was even more special for them than it was for myself and my partner (as Joey and I had enjoyed some international success in the past). I really wanted to win for these guys!

I cannot stress enough the importance of the camaraderie that our team enjoyed. I have played on more talented and experienced teams before, but I have never played on another team in which there was so little friction between partners and teammates. Negativity can be very destructive to bridge results, but that was not an issue with this particular team.

Our Captain, Nick Gartaganis, wanted to play Joey and me in the first 12-board quarter, but I asked him for a break. The first quarter started only an hour or so after our match against Italy ended and I was mentally and emotionally drained after the spectacular set of deals that we had just finished. In particular, the second last board of the Italy match really took its toll on me. I thought that I had lost the match by making a tricky bid that had resulted in a no-play slam. I had not learned until when we compared results with our teammates that the slam was actually laydown and that I had merely misunderstood Joey's claim.

So Joey and I went to the bar while our 4 teammates sat down to play the first quarter. Were we nervous? No. By this time I had learned that my "unknown" teammates were more than capable of holding their own against world class opposition. They had demonstrated this consistently throughout this tournament and it was clear that they were all mentally prepared for the final hurdle that our team would have to face.

This made it easy for Joey and me to relax and collect our energy for the 36 boards that our team would have to play the next day. Whatever happened in the first quarter was now out of our hands. Hopefully our team would do well, but regardless of the score, Joey and I (along with our teammates of course) were going to have to play well in the remainder of the match in order to have a chance. Worrying for 2 hours was not going to help our cause.

It turned out that the first quarter was a well-played and low-scoring affair. Canada came out on top 13 IMPs to 7 IMPs. Poland had started the match with a 2.5 IMP carryover (which they earned by defeating Canada when we met in the round robin). We thus went to sleep that night with a small, but psychologically relevant, 3.5 IMP lead.

sk|w|nt|In the second quarter, Joey and I sat down to play Adam and Cesary on vugraph. Nick and Peter played at the other table for Canada. I will present all 12 of the deals from what turned out to be a remarkable set of boards for Canada. I was dealt a really awful hand on the first board of this quarter. Maybe I would be able to just sit there, pass, follow suit, and wait for the next deal...|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|Bad thinking. It is critical to maintain a high level of focus even when you are dealt a horrible hand. Relax when you are the dummy, but pay close attention otherwise - any bid that you make or any card that you play could decide the match. |

hs|ws|hs|wh|nt|Adam's next call was 3@H. Adam would have passed here if he had nothing to say. His 3@H bid, therefore, suggested that he held at least 5 cards in hearts. Cesary raised to 4@H which became the final contract. I was happy to have 5 trumps and a singleton in my partner's suit, but I did not consider doubling - I had no reason to believe that we would be able to win 4 tricks on defense.|

hs|wd|nt|I switched to the @D8 (as opposed to leading back an honest count card) since I wanted to tell Joey that I had nothing of value in the diamond suit. |

hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|As far as I could tell, however, nobody at the tournament seemed to realize that, although finessing the @D9 was an interesting play, that finesse posed an unnecessary risk. Adam could have made 4@H on a similar line by crossing back to the @DJ (as he did at the table) |

nt|I have no idea if Adam "should" have made his contract or not, but his decision to play me for the @CK was certainly reasonable. I was pleased with myself after this deal as it felt like my diamond discards had fooled one of the greatest players in the world into playing me for the @CK. I didn't know if we would win any IMPs on this deal, but it felt like we had won a psychological battle.|

sk|w|mb|p|mb|p|mb|?|nt|On the second board I was dealt the balanced 12-count shown above. Joey and Adam both passed and I had to decide what call to make. Joey and I play 5-card majors and 15-17 1NT openings. What call do you think I made?|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^1H|

hs|wh|mb|1h|
nt|Sorry if I tricked you by saying that we play 5-card majors, but I chose to open 1@H despite holding only a 4-card major. 1@D is certainly a reasonable alternative. Pass is not for me - I open almost all hands with 12 HCP regardless of the vulnerability and position.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|When I learned to play bridge (around 1980) 5-card majors was already "standard" in North America. I have never played 4-card majors and it is quite rare for me to open 1@H or 1@S on a 4-card suit. On this hand I judged that the lead-directing value of 1@H made this call worth the risk (a serious risk, by the way - a lot of things could go wrong as a result of this action). |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ls|wh|mb|p|mb|1s|mb|p|mb|?|nt|
Cesary passed, Joey responded 1@S, and Adam passed again. It was back to me. What call do you think I made?|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^P|
mb|p|nt|I chose to pass Joey in 1@S. I considered this a close decision between pass and 2@S. 2@S has the advantage of making it harder for the opponents to get into the bidding if it happens to be their hand. Pass has the advantage of preventing our side from getting overboard when Joey has a good passed hand. Some players might prefer 1NT here, but I didn't like that choice. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|es|hs|ss|mb|p|sk||nt|Cesary passed and 1@S was the final contract. Adam led his singleton trump, not the best start for the defense, but Joey was always going to make 1@S. He played carefully and would up winning 8 tricks for +110. I knew there would not be many IMPs swung on this deal, but I was happy that the actions I had chosen resulted in the best possible score with our cards.|

mb|1c|an|Polish Club|mb|?|
nt|
On the next deal Adam dealt and opened with another Polish 1@C. I had a nice hand, but my awkward pattern made no bid particularly attractive. What call do you think I made?|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^p|mb|p|nt|I chose to pass in the hope that I would get a chance to make a takeout double of hearts later in the auction. Pass looks really good on paper, but in my experience passing with this strong a hand will often not work out in practice. As such, I usually go out of my way to bid something in a situation like this and I seriously considered making a flawed 1NT overcall.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|I like to overcall 1NT and I normally have no inhibitions about doing so with off-shape hands. Playing against a Polish 1@C, however, I thought that it made sense to keep quiet until I learned more about Adam's hand type. I am not adverse to occasionally overcalling at the 1-level on a 4-card suit, but I don't like 1@S on this hand - the spades are too weak and the hand is too strong.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


mb|1d|mb|p|mb|1h|mb|d|nt|The Polish 1@C opening is often based on a minimum hand, but it is forcing. Cesary's 1@D response showed either a poor hand or a hand with diamonds. Joey passed and Adam rebid 1@H to suggest a balanced minimum with 3 or 4 hearts. I had been hoping for a chance to make a takeout double of hearts and was pleased to be able to do so now.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3d|mb|p|mb|?|
nt|Cesary passed (suggesting that he was willing to play in 1@H) and Joey jumped to 3@D, a natural bid showing invitational values opposite a normal takeout double of 1@H. What call do you think I made now?|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^3H|
hs|wh|mb|3h|nt|I certainly had more in the way of high cards than I had promised and my first instinct was to simply jump to 5@D. Fortunately, I took the time to give this problem a second thought. After thinking about some of the hands that Joey might hold, I realized that we might belong in 3NT instead of 5@D. I therefore bid 3@H in order to bring Joey's judgment into play.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


ls|wh|mb|d|mb|3n|nt|Cesary doubled my 3@H cuebid and Joey bid 3NT anyway. His 3NT in this auction is a ^*Bstrong^*N suggestion to play in that contract as he could have passed if he was not sure about where he wanted to play. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|at|I thus had an easy pass and 3NT became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


sk||
hs|sh|nt|Adam had no trouble finding the best lead of a low heart given Cesary's double of 3@H. |
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|h6|hs|sd|hs|nd|hs|ss|hs|ns|at|3NT was far from laydown, but the friendly position of the defenders' diamond and spade honors allowed Joey to come to 9 tricks without breathing hard. +400 for Canada.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|ns|ls|sd|ls|nd|
hs|ed|Hs|wd|nt|Although this looked like a flattish board, it felt like we had dodged a bullet. While Joey might well have made 5@D on the actual layout, I was glad that he did not have to suffer though that awkward contract. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


hs|eh|ls|ed|ls|wd|hs|eh|hs|sh|hs|nh|at|Note that Poland also dodged a bullet here. They had no comfortable place to play and we might have collected a nice penalty if Joey had somehow known to pass 1@H doubled.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|eh|hs|ed|nt|Joey's 3@D was not a thing of beauty and I am sure that he wished that he had been dealt a better (or longer) diamond suit. It is not Joey's style to pass 1@H doubled on a hand like this and I think he did very well to express his values with a jump to 3@D. If he had bid 1NT or 2@D instead, I would have been under a lot more pressure to get our side to game.|

at|Cesary led the @D6 (the Poles lead middle from 3-card holdings and small from a worthless doubleton). When Joey put his dummy down it became apparent that his 3@S call had been aggressive. There was a good chance that the Polish pair holding our cards would not get to game. I had better make my contract! Think about how you would play before reading on.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


hs|ed|nt|This is an extremely complex hand and I have no idea what the best line of play is. I gave the matter about 5 minutes thought before I called for a card from dummy.

I will just show you how I chose to play the hand.|

up|39|hs|sh|hs|nh|nt|There are some interesting points about this deal. Notice that Cesary made a weak jump overcall on a 5-card suit and that Adam passed over Joey's negative double with 4-card heart support. Both of these calls would be unusual among North American experts. Perhaps the Poles have some stylistic difference when it comes to weak jump overcalls.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|nh|hs|nd|nt|Also note Cesary's choice of opening lead (a diamond as opposed to a heart). In my experience, the top players from Poland and Italy lead from 2 or 3 small cards much more frequently than their North American counterparts (who prefer to lead from suits headed by honors). I find it interesting that experts in various parts of the world have differing theories on such "basic" parts of the game.|

nt|Let's look at the next deal from Joey's point of view. Joey opened 1@S as dealer at favorable vulnerability and I responded 1NT. Joey and I play that 1NT is ^*Isemi-forcing^*N (meaning that Joey would only pass with a bare minimum opener and 5332 distribution). My 1NT could contain up to a bad 12 HCP. What would you rebid with Joey's hand?|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Joey make?^^2s|mb|2s|
nt|Joey chose to rebid a slightly conservative 2@S. 3@S would be a perfectly acceptable call for many players, but in our partnership a 3@S rebid would suggest better playing strength. Also, this hand looks like notrump to me and, for Joey and I, 3@S would suggest a very suit-oriented hand. |
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


ls|es|hs|ec|nt|In retrospect I am surprised that Joey did not rebid 2@C. Our mutual mentor, ^*BEric Kokish^*N, would certainly make that call. |
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


ls|ec|at|I would also consider a 2NT rebid to be reasonable even though this bid would show 18-19 HCP in our partnership. |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|sk||
hs|es|hs|ws|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|I like my partner's call the best because he found the only way to get a plus score with our cards! Joey's 2@S ended the auction and, if he had bid his hand in any other way, we would have got to game. With spades 4-1 neither 4@S nor 3NT has any chance. |

nt|In theory we did the right thing by stopping in 2@S on this deal as 4@S requires a heart guess, a 3-2 trump break, and no defensive club ruff. |

ls|eh|ls|wh|ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ed|hs|wd|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|It is hard to say if 3NT is better. If the defense does not lead diamonds then 3NT is a favorite. Cesary would have led a small diamond against 3NT. It looks strange, but it may be correct for declarer to play the @D8 from dummy at trick 1.|

nt|On the next deal Joey and I arrived in 2@S after Adam had opened the bidding with another Polish 1@C. Cesary led a club so I had to lose 2 tricks in that suit along with 3 trump tricks. 2@S made exactly for +110. On the actual layout 5@D (or 4@H!) can be made, but both are poor contracts and our side did not have the values to be in game. Our result felt like a push.|

nt|In fact, most of the boards that we had played up to this point felt like they would probably be pushed. That was fine with me. Although we had not had any results yet that were "certain" to gain IMPs, our set had been very solid so far. There seemed to be no place that we could possibly lose IMPs. That was about to change.|

nt|On the next deal Joey opened 1@D in third position, I responded 1@S, and Joey jump-shifted to 3@C. In our style, a jump-shift rebid by opener does not merely say, "I have 19 HCP" - it says, "I have a ^*Bvery^*N strong hand and I can ^*Bcontrol the auction^*N". Joey would have rebid only 2@C on a lot of hands with which most players would rebid 3@C without thinking twice.|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt|The first time I played with Joey was about 8 years ago. Joey was already long established as a successful tournament player, but I was no more than a "young talent". I had not done much winning yet for a few reasons: I was not very competitive by nature, I made too many careless mistakes, and, despite a lot of play and study, I really did not know much about bidding.|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt|Joey changed all of that and, although several other top players have made a positive impact on my bridge skills and career, Joey did more for my game than the rest of these put together. When we first played together I didn't really care about winning. A pleasant partner and some interesting hands were enough to make a bridge tournament a success for me.|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt|Joey is very competitive by nature and he cares immensely about winning. I realized that if I wanted to play with him (and I liked playing with him), I had better start caring about winning too. I started putting more effort into playing bridge and found that I started to make far fewer errors. Sure enough we started winning - and winning was really fun!|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|When I started playing with Joey I was already pretty good at the technical aspects of the game. You can learn that from books. The only way to really learn the partnership aspects of the game (bidding, defense, and how to make your partner play his best) is to have the experience of playing with a partner who already understands these things.|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


nt|Joey understood. A lot of it rubbed off on me. Here is one of the most important partnership principles that I learned from Joey:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BEvery bid is either a statement or a question.^*N }
^-|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt|It sounds so simple (and maybe even obvious), but I don't think there are very many players who think this way. The way we play, Joey's 3@C is a ^*Bstatement^*N. It doesn't "show" any specific number of high card points. 3@C ^*Bstates^*N, "I am forcing to game and I know what my next bid will be - I can control the auction."|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|I believe that most players (even if they are not aware of it) think of 3@C in this auction more as a ^*Bquestion^*N - "I have a lot of points, what do you think the contract should be?" In our style, the responder tries to "stay out of opener's way" after a jump-shift. Responder will often make a false preference to 3@D in order to "slow down the auction".|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt|It would not surprise me if ^*BEric Kokish^*N (who also bids this way) would bid 3@D on my hand despite the void! For him 3@D is basically an artificial bid, a ^*Bquestion^*N that asks opener what his hand is all about (remember, opener must have a ^*Bprepared rebid^*N when he jump shifts). Joey and I don't go quite this far. For us 3@D here would be at least a ^*Ilittle bit^*N natural.|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt|Besides, I wanted to make a ^*Bstatement^*N, not ask a ^*Bquestion^*N. I had an unusual hand and I was not sure that I wanted to hear Joey make his ^*Bprepared rebid^*N. I thought about the various rebids that Joey might be prepared to make...|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt|
If Joey was planning on bidding 4@D at his next turn, I wanted to discourage him from doing that (since we probably belonged in 3NT in this case). 

|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


hs|wc|nt|I didn't really like the prospect of a 4@C bid at Joey's next turn either. I had a reasonable hand opposite a big minor 2-suiter, but there was no way I was going to be able to describe my strange hand to Joey or learn enough about his hand to decide accurately between 5@C and 6@C. I really did not want to get involved in clubs - I was willing to settle for 3NT opposite a true 2-suiter.|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


hs|ws|ls|wc|nt|If Joey was planning on raising spades (to show 3-card support), I anticipated a similarly torturous auction, ultimately leading to a guess. I didn't want any part of that either. I had a lot of hearts to deal with opposite 3154 (or similar). 4@S rated to be fine, but 3NT would also be safe. |
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


ls|ws|
nt|
The only other rebid that Joey could have been planning was 3NT. In this case, I thought that we would be ok if I bid 3NT. |
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


mb|3n|nt|So I bid 3NT. 3NT is a ^*Bstatement^*N that says, "I think there is a very good chance that this is the right contract. Perhaps you should not make your ^*Bplanned rebid^*N". On this particular hand, I did not "know" 3NT was the right contract, but I did "know" that 3NT was making and that it would be impossible to accurately choose between other contracts or to explore for slam.|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|wh|nt|The way most people play, 3NT would be a very common response to a jump shift by the opening bidder. The way Joey and I play, 3NT is a very rare response in this auction. 3NT here suggests very strong holdings in both major suits and no interest in playing anywhere else. |
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


ls|ws|nt|What about the concept of bidding 3@H instead of 3NT? It would be a wonderful concept if 3@H suggested 5-5 in the majors, but Joey and I had never discussed this auction (not surprising as we had not discussed very many auctions). There is a strong case for 3@H to show something like 5413 distribution and a non-positional heart holding (like @HAxxx) for notrump.|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt|So 3@H was an ambiguous bid. That was enough for me not to bid 3@H. Remember how I said that Joey is good at getting his partner's to play well? One of the ways he does that is by not making ambiguous bids. Putting your partner to the test in the bidding is not winning bridge. My 3NT was certainly not perfect, but this call was definitely unambiguous in our partnership.|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt|I really don't know if 3NT is a good bid or not. I am sure that a lot of experts would consider my 3NT ridiculous and bid the "obvious" 3@H instead. Perhaps the only fair way to judge my 3NT is to see how it turned out...|

up|7|ls|sc|ls|ss|ls|nc|ls|ns|nt|This was a clear minus position - our first of the quarter. It is not clear that you ^*Iwant^*N to be in slam on our cards. Both 6@S and 6@C look somewhat hit or miss to me. Still, I thought there was a very good chance that the Poles holding our cards would get to a slam. I did not like our result at all.|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


nt|Maybe my 3NT was a bad bid. Maybe Joey should have opened 2@C (you may recall that I opened 2@C on a similar hand with 5-5 in the majors in the first ^*BDeal of the Week^*N in this series). Maybe Joey should have bid over 3NT. Here is how Joey and I think about these things: you cannot always get to the right contract.|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


nt|Many players, after a result like this, would spend needless energy thinking about who should have bid what to get to where. Joey and I don't think about it at all. We bid what we bid because it seemed right at the time. Thinking about it during the next hand wastes energy. Talking about it at the table is even worse. It doesn't matter who should have bid what. Go on to the next hand...|

nt|So I went on to the next hand, but little did I know that I would be in a similar bidding position soon. Again I had a distributional hand with a lot of offensive potential, but no good bid to make. At least I knew what trumps should be this time. Joey opened 1@H, I responded 1@S, and Joey jumped to 4@S (suggesting a very strong 4522 hand - he would normally splinter if he had a short minor). |
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


nt|It felt like my hand was worth a slam try, but nothing seemed right. 4NT (RKCB 1430) would be ridiculous. I could not cuebid in either minor and I would never cuebid a void in Joey's suit - he would expect me to have the @HA or @HK if I bid 5@H. Maybe 5@S is reasonable, but again, I did not want to torture my partner with an ambiguous bid (or go down at the 5-level for that matter).|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|nt|I therefore passed and 4@S became the final contract. I knew that 6@S might be laydown, but I had no way to find out and experience suggests stretching to bid close slams is a losing tactic at IMPs (especially when a good auction is impossible and even more so when going down at the 5-level is a definite possibility). |

nt|I chose to make a weak jump overcall of 2@S. This was a slightly undisciplined action. The side 4-card heart suit was a minor flaw that I could easily accept. The lack of any good spade spots was a more serious consideration. 2@S could go for a big number. Also, Joey would normally expect me to hold a stronger suit for a vulnerable weak jump overcall.|
pg| ***** 201 ***** |


nt|I am not sure if I would have overcalled 2@S over a "Standard American" 1@C opening. I might, but I also might overcall 1@S or pass. Against a Polish 1@C, I thought 2@S had more going for it. A Polish 1@C opening can be based on a wide variety of hand types and I wanted my opponents to have to resolve this uncertainty at as high a level as possible. |

hs|wd|hs|ed|hs|ss|hs|ns|nt|Here is the last deal of the 12-board quarter. Cesary opened 4@S in second seat, Joey overcalled 5@D, Adam raised to 5@S, and I raised to 6@D, ending the auction. It turns out that Cesary and Adam had both been aggressive and we could have collected a +500 penalty againt 5@S doubled. Still, my 6@D bid felt very normal at the time.|

nt|Normal or not, my 6@D bid had got us to a slam off 2 Aces. The defenders took one of their Aces at trick 1 when Adam led a spade to Cesary's @SA. |

hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|The comparison with our teammates was a lot of fun! On the first board, where Adam was -200 in 4@H (where he could have made his contract if he had guessed the @CK), Nick and Peter also got to 4@H. They didn't make the contract either, but they were only -100. 3 IMPs to Canada. |

nt|The next swing came a few boards later on the deal in which I faced an interesting play problem in 4@S. Nick and Peter had done very well at the other table. They bought the hand for 3@H doubled the other way and failed by only 1 trick for -100. We were +620 so Canada won 11 more IMPs. |

hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|On the board in which Joey judged well to rebid only 2@S (and made +140), the Poles had been more aggressive with our cards. Their 3NT was against the odds, but not hopeless. With spades 4-1, 3NT had no chance. Nick and Peter were +50 on defense. 5 IMPs to Canada. |

nt|Finally, on the board where Joey and I had been allowed to make 6@D off 2 Aces, the auction was much tamer at the other table. The Polish East-West pair played in 3NT with our cards and won 11 tricks for +460. We were +920 in 6@D and Canada had won another 10 IMPs.|

Nick and Peter had done just about everything right at the other table and their results fit very nicely with ours. It seemed impossible, but Canada had outscored the mighty Polish team 44 IMPs to 0 over the 12-board second quarter! There were only 24 boards left and we now led by almost 50 IMPs! Nobody was counting Poland out of it yet, but it was really starting to look like I was a member of a team of destiny. 

A Gold Medal in the 2002 IOC Grand Prix would make a very nice 37th birthday present!
