I was the declarer when this week's deal was played in the round of 64 of the Spingold Teams at the recent ^*BNorth American Bridge Championships^*N in Washington, DC. I would like to be able to report on some deals from later rounds of this event, but unfortunately my team was eliminated in the round of 32. I was playing with ^*BBrad Moss^*N when this week's deal was played.

nt|This week's first deal was the 3rd last board of a 64-board IMP match. It felt like our team was leading by about 20 IMPs at the point in the match when this deal was played. Of course, the actual score was unknown to me at the time. Brad, North, dealt and passed and East opened with a 3@C preempt. What call do you think I made as South?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^3S|hs|ss|mb|3S|
nt|I chose to overcall 3@S despite the fact that Brad was a passed hand and that I had "only 12 HCP". For sure something terrible could have happened to me, but given that 4@S would have a play opposite any hand with an Ace and 4-card trump support, it seemed clear to me to bid. Preempts create danger, but bridge players who live in fear do not win very many tournaments.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|sd|nt|As for overcalling 3@D (instead of 3@S), I don't like it. It is true that the opponents may have a harder time doubling you in diamonds than in spades, but 4@S is by far the most likely game contract on this deal. Overcalling 3@D will make it difficult (or impossible) to get to 4@S opposite many hands where 10 tricks in spades are either likely or certain.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|?|
nt|After a few seconds of thought, West doubled 3@S. Even though West did not seem confident about his double, I was already regretting my decision to overcall 3@S! Both Brad and East passed and I now had to consider whether or not I should run to 4@D.

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


lb|*MDid Fred run to 4 Diamonds?^Yes~No^2|

ls|sd|mb|p|hs|ss|nt|I chose to pass and 3@S doubled became the final contract. In general I am a runner. In my experience, when the opponents double the first suit that is bid for penalties, they are usually right and it is a good idea to try to find another suit to play in! |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|On this particular deal, however, I judged to stand my ground for 2 reasons. First, the uncertainty of West's double suggested that he was doubling on high cards (as opposed to a trump stack). Second, West might have a very strong diamond holding -- I did not like the idea of running to 4@D only to have Brad take me back to spades at the 4-level. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||ls|ss|pc|CQ|
hs|ns|hs|nd|at|West's opening lead was the @CQ and Brad's @SQ96 and doubleton diamond were good to see in the dummy. What a relief that I had not run to 4@D! While 9 tricks in spades were a long way away, it appeared that I was not going to go down a lot here.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ns|hs|nc|nt|Playing the @CK could never gain (and might cost) so I played low from the dummy at trick 1. |

ls|ss|pc|S3|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|In order to come anywhere close to 9 tricks I was going to have to get the diamonds going so I led the @DK out of my hand immediately. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|sd|
pc|DK|at|West gave this some thought, |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


pc|D2|pc|D3|pc|D5|at|but he chose to duck his @DA. East followed with the @D5. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|sd|at|Continuing diamonds was clear and, since I really did not want to have East on lead, I led the @DQ to the next trick. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|sd|
pc|DQ|pc|DA|pc|D7|pc|D9|at|West won the @DA as East contributed the @D9. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


pc|D6|hs|ns|nt|West returned the @D6. The defenders were using standard signals so East's diamond plays suggested an odd number of cards in that suit. It did occur to me that perhaps East had not played high low from a doubleton diamond because he could not overruff the dummy. In any case, ruffing with dummy's @S9 seemed right |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|S9|pc|C4|pc|D4|at|(even more so when East discarded on this trick!).|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|ss|nt|I continued by ruffing a heart in my hand. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ss|ls|nh|
pc|H9|pc|H3|pc|S5|pc|H6|at|When both defenders followed small to this trick, I had a complete count on the hand. East obviously started with 7 clubs (or West would have continued clubs at trick 2). He had followed to 2 rounds of diamonds and 3 rounds of hearts. Given East's preempt and his earlier play of the @HK, the @HQ (the last outstanding heart) rated to be with West.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


sk||hs|es|hs|ws|nt|I was therefore confident that East had started with 1327 distribution. Obviously his singleton spade was not the @SJ or the @S10 (as he would have overruffed dummy's @S9 if he had been dealt either of those cards). |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|es|hs|sd|hs|wd|nt|I continued with a fourth round of diamonds and West followed with the @DJ. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|wd|pc|DT|pc|DJ|
hs|es|hs|ns|at|I had to decide whether to ruff with dummy's @SQ or @S6. East's singleton spade was not the @SJ or @S10, but was it the @S7 or a small spade (the @S4 or @S2)?|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


md|0,s2,,s7|nt|If I decided to ruff with the @S6 and East was able to overruff with the @S7, I would be down 2 for -300. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|pc|s6|pc|s7|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|ec|at|East would be able to cash his @CA (the setting trick) |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|ca|pc|c6|pc|hq|pc|c8|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


mc|7|hs|ec|hs|ws|at|and a third round of clubs would ensure a second undertrick for the defense. -300 was a number that I really wanted to avoid!|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|ws|up|6|hs|es|hs|ns|nt|Avoiding -300 when East's singleton spade was the @S7 was possible. I could get out for down 1 on this layout by ruffing the fourth round of diamonds with dummy's @SQ. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|pc|sq|pc|c5|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|ss|At|I would then be able to win a sixth trick by ruffing a heart with the @S8. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|ss|pc|ht|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|hq|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


hs|ss|mc|8|at|The @SA and @SK would represent my 7th and 8th tricks and the contract would be down only 1 for -100. Not so bad. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|ss|up|6|hs|ns|md|0,s7,,s2|
hs|es|nt|Ruffing with the @SQ would similarly result in down 1 if East's singleton spade was the @S4 or @S2 (as opposed to the @S7). |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|pc|sq|pc|c5|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


mc|8|hs|nh|hs|ss|at|As before, I could score a heart ruff with my @S8 and get up to 8 tricks with the @SA and @SK. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|ss|up|2|hs|es|hs|ns|nt|If East had been dealt a singleton @S4 or @S2, however, I had a chance to make my contract by ruffing the fourth round of diamonds with dummy's @S6 (instead of with the @SQ). |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|pc|S6|hs|es|hs|ec|at|East, unable to overruff, would discard a club on this trick. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |

pc|D8|pc|S4|pc|SQ|pc|C9|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hs|ec|hs|ws|mc|9|hs|ss|at|With 7 tricks in the bag and the @SA and @SK still to come, I would claim my contract for +530. Note that East's @CA and West's natural spade trick would end up being compressed into a single winner for the defense. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|ss|ls|ws|up|10|hs|ns|nt|
Once again we are back at the critical point of the deal. Do you think that I ruffed with the @SQ or the @S7 and why? |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


lb|*CWhat card did Fred play?^^s6^Sq6|

nt|I ended up making the winning decision of ruffing the fourth round of diamonds with the @S6 which resulted in a very welcome +530. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|s6|
hs|es|at|Certainly one of the main reasons that I played the @S6 was that the odds were 2 to 1 that this play would work (gaining when East was dealt a singleton @S2 |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


md|0,s2,,s4|at|or @S4 |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


md|0,s4,,s7|at|and only losing when East was dealt a singleton @S7). |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|Furthermore, I knew that I had more to gain than I had to lose by ruffing with the @S6. If East had been dealt a singleton @S7, ruffing with the @S6 would convert a possible -100 (that I could achieve by ruffing with the @SQ) to -300. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


md|0,s7,,s2|at|If East had been dealt a singleton @S4 or @S2, however, ruffing with the @S6 would convert a possible -100 to +530. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


up|1|ls|es|hs|ns|nt|In a team match, the proper way to figure out a problem like whether to ruff with the @SQ or the @S6 is to attempt to compute the "IMP odds". The basic method is to try to guess at the most likely result at the other table (difficult in this case) and then figure out the IMP scores that rate to result from various actions.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|ns|hc|sq|nt|For the sake of argument, assume that the North-South pair at the other table receives a small minus score on this deal (either by defending a successful club partial or by going down in a spade contract). If North-South are on average -100 at the other table, I could have guaranteed a push board by ruffing with the @SQ at the critical point. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


md|0,s2,,s7|lc|sq|hs|es|hc|s6|nt|Ruffing with the @S6 will result in -300 and a 5 IMP loss (versus -100) 1/3 of the time (when East's spade singleton is the @S7). |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


md|0,s7,,s2|at|2/3 of the time, however, (when East's singleton spade is the @S4 or @S2) ruffing with the @S6 will result in +530 for a 12 IMP gain. These calculations suggest that it is clear to ruff with the @S6 in an attempt to make the contract. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|In the actual match, there was one other factor to consider: There were only a few boards left in the match and I strongly suspected that our team had a reasonable lead. This would argue in favor of playing safe for down 1 in an attempt to not lose a swing. The strong IMP odds and the fact that I did not really know the score of the match convinced me to discount this factor.|
