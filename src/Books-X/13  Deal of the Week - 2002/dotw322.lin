^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 322 - November 11, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Is bridge skill genetic? One look at the family of my regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, would suggest that the answer to this question might well be yes. Brad's mother, ^*BGail Greenberg^*N, and his sister, ^*BJill Levin^*N, are both World Champions. His father ^*BMike Moss^*N has never won a World Championship (he came second once), but Mike has been a force in ACBL National Events for over 40 years. Some other famous bridge families in which there have been great players in more than one generation include the ^*BSeamons^*N of the United States and the ^*BHacketts^*N of Great Britain.

France's ^*BBessis^*N family is another case in point. ^*BVeronique Bessis^*N has been a mainstay of the French Ladies Team, one of the strongest in the world, for many years. Her husband ^*BMIchel^*N is also a world class player who has represented his country internationally. Their sons ^*BOlivier^*N and ^*BThomas^*N are members of France's Junior Bridge Team and both appear to have bright bridge futures ahead of them.

This week's deal was played by ^*BOlivier Bessis^*N at this year's European Junior Championships. Olivier won the award for the Best Played Hand of the tournament for his efforts on this week's deal. The deal is presented as a declarer play problem.

Think about how you would continue as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|Sh|nt|Olivier had what appeared to be a loser in hearts |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|so his contract would depend on not losing a trump trick. Given that East was known to have 7 clubs, the odds favored finessing West for the @SQ. Olivier realized this, but found a pretty way to give himself an extra chance if it turned out that East had been dealt a doubleton @SQ. Do you know how he played?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Olivier started well by leading a heart toward his @HA. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|
pc|H5|at|If East wanted to ruff in, he was welcome to do so. Olivier was going to have to lose a heart trick anyway and, if East decided to ruff his partner's winner, Olivier would have no trouble picking up the @SQ later in the play. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


pc|H4|hs|sh|at|It turns out that East followed with the @H4 and Olivier won his @HA |

hs|nd|hs|sd|at|and then played a diamond to dummy's @DK. The danger of East being able to ruff this trick was minimal since East almost certainly would have switched to a diamond (instead of a heart) at trick 3 if he had been dealt a singleton in that suit. |

pc|D8|pc|D3|pc|DK|pc|DJ|at|Both defenders followed to this trick as Olivier had expected. |

pc|C3|hs|ss|at|East discarded a club and Olivier ruffed in his hand to win the trick. |

ls|ss|pc|S2|pc|D5|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|By this time, he had learned that East had started with exactly 7 clubs, exactly 2 diamonds, and at least 2 hearts. East almost certainly had been dealt either 2227 or 1327 distribution. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|Olivier found a way to guarantee his contract from this point against either 2227 or 1327 distribution in the East hand. Can you see how he played from here? |

ls|ss|pc|SJ|pc|S5|hs|ns|at|and, when West followed suit with the last outstanding spade spot, Olivier called for a small spade from the dummy. |

ls|ns|pc|S6|sk||md|0,sq,,h8|nt|That is an example of the sort of finesse that expert declarers live for - a finesse that could not lose, even if it lost! |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|eh|at|If it turned out that West had started with 3 spades to the @SQ (meaning that East's 13th card was a heart), then the spade finesse would win and Olivier would not lose a trump trick. |
