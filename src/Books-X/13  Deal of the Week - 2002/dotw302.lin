^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 302 - June 24, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
I was the declarer on both of this week's deals, but I was satisfied with my effort on only the second of these. Both deals took place in the quarter-finals of the recent ^*BUnited States Bridge Championships^*N in Memphis. My partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and myself were part of the ^*BWelland^*N team that defeated the ^*BPavlicek^*N team in the quarter-finals, thereby advancing to the semi-finals. Unfortunately (for me at least), Welland lost to the ^*BSchwartz^*N team in the semis (Schwartz subsequently lost to the ^*BNickell Team^*N in the finals of the USBC). On both of this week's deals (which have been rotated to make South the declarer) my opponents were ^*BRichard Pavlicek^*N and ^*BMichael Polowan^*N.

We have received a great deal of complimentary e-mail concerning our free live broadcast of the USBC on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. Several additional free live broadcasts of major tournaments are planned during the next couple of months, including the complete final match of the ^*BCanadian National Teams Championships^*N on June 24. I will be in Edmonton, the site of this year's CNTC, in order to do the data entry for this broadcast and to provide live commentary and analysis.

hs|sd|hs|sc|nt|On this week's first deal I opened 1@D in first position and rebid 2@C over Brad's 1@S response. |

at|Brad's 2@H was an artificial game force and my 3@C suggested at least 5-5 in the minors. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|sd|hs|sh|mb|P|mb|3D|mb|P|mb|3H|
at|Brad showed diamond support with his 3@D and my 3@H suggested shortness in spades and a hand unsuitable for bidding 3NT. I was basically stalling for more information... |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sd|mb|P|mb|4S|mb|P|mb|6D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|And more information is what I received! Brad's jump to 4@S suggested a powerful spade suit in a hand with slam interest. I was not sure how to continue from here (perhaps 5@H is best in theory), but I chose to bid what I thought I could make - 6@D - which became the final contract. |

Richard's opening lead was the @H2 (4th best) and I won Michael's @HK with my @HA. |

at|Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sc|nt|I gave the early play of this hand a great deal of thought. To me it was far from clear as to whether I should try to set up dummy's spades or my own clubs. I tried to do the math, but I didn't get very far. I eventually chose to play on clubs on the theory that a 5-1 club break was less likely than a 5-2 spade break (admittedly a serious oversimplification of the problem). |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ns|hs|nc|nt|I therefore led a club to dummy's @CA |

hs|nc|hs|sc|at|I continued with a club to my @CK |

ls|nc|ls|sc|
pc|C2|pc|C5|pc|CK|pc|CQ|at|and I was pleased to see Richard follow with the @CQ. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|At this point, barring a 5-0 diamond break, the contract was certain. I could simply draw trump |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|sc|at|and surrender a club trick to the defense. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|nd|at|I considered ruffing a club in the dummy at this point (partly to try to guard against 5-0 diamonds and partly in an attempt to make an overtrick), but I decided that this could lead to trouble if Richard's @CQ had been a falsecard. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|sd|nt|I therefore played a diamond to dummy's @DK and I was all set to claim |

pc|D3|pc|D2|pc|DK|pc|HJ|at|until Michael shocked me by discarding on this trick! At this point I realized that I had made a serious mistake and unfortunately there was no way for me to recover. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sc|nt|In desperation I tried to cash dummy's remaining high spade for a club discard, |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|sc|
pc|SQ|pc|S6|pc|C7|pc|D6|at|but Richard was able to ruff (I took a small amount of solace in the fact that the alternative line of trying to set up the spades would not have worked) |

ls|sd|pc|D4|pc|H9|pc|DA|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|nd|nt|I still would have been ok if the clubs had been 3-3, but when I went to ruff a club in the dummy, |

ls|sc|ls|nd|
pc|CT|pc|D7|pc|H8|pc|C8|at|Richard ruffed in |

pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|D5|pc|S9|pc|DQ|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|sc|at|and claimed down 2 as I still had an unavoidable club loser. As the opponents at the other table stopped in 3NT with our cards, -200 was an especially painful result. |mc|10|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


up|20|sk||nt|The pain increased when I realized that I could (and should) have made this slam. In fact, I had been following the only winning path up until the trick at which I tried to draw trump. Suppose I had led a club instead at this point. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|ct|hs|wd|nt|Suppose first that Richard ruffs in with a middle trump. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d6|hs|nd|at|I would overruff with dummy's @DK (strangely enough, discarding a spade on this trick would also work) |

pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|wd|at|I would then lead another club and Richard would win only 1 trump trick regardless of whether he ruffed or discarded on this trick. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


up|7|ls|sc|ls|wd|hs|wh|nt|Now suppose that Richard discards (instead of ruffing in) on the third round of clubs. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|h5|hs|nd|at|I would then be able to win the trick by ruffing small in the dummy. |

hs|sc|hs|wd|hs|nd|at|Richard would be forced to ruff in on the next round of clubs and I would then overruff with dummy's @DK. |

ls|sc|ls|wd|ls|nd|pc|c7|pc|d6|pc|dk|pc|cj|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|There are several ways to come to 12 tricks from this point, but the simplest of these would be to try to draw trump. When the 5-0 break is revealed, |

ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|wd|pc|d5|pc|s6|pc|da|pc|d2|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


mc|12|hs|sc|hs|wd|at|I would know to lead my winning club to hold Richard to one trump trick as before. That would have been a very nicely played hand - I wish I had figured it out at the table!|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


sk|S|ls|sc|ls|wd|pn|Fred,Richard,Brad,Michael,Passell,Rodwell,Cayne,Meckstroth|md|3SAQ4HKJDA93CQ9852,SKJ72H95432DT8CJ6,ST8653HQDK762CAK4,S9HAT876DQJ54CT73|sv|n|mb|P|mb|P|mb|1N|mb|P|mb|2H|an|Transfer|mb|P|mb|2S|mb|P|mb|3N|mb|P|mb|4S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

hs|ss|nt|I did better on this week's second deal, but the layout of the defenders's hands was such that the clever play that I found (at least I thought it was clever) turned out not to matter. I was the declarer in 4@S after a third seat 1NT opening bid and a transfer sequence. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||ls|ss|pc|H3|at|Richard led the @H3 (still 4th best) |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|HQ|pc|HA|pc|HJ|at|and Michael won the @HA. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


pc|S9|at|Michael switched to the @S9, strongly suggesting the he had been dealt either a singleton @S9 or a doubleton @S9x. Think about how you would continue as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|I chose to start by playing the @SQ to this trick (you will see why soon) |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|SQ|pc|SK|pc|S3|at|and, as expected, Richard won the @SK. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


pc|H4|hs|nd|hs|sh|at|Richard switched back to hearts and I discarded a diamond from the dummy as I won the @HK in my hand. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sh|pc|D2|pc|HT|pc|HK|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|I strongly suspected that I was going to have to lose another trump trick |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sc|at|so I had to hope that I would eventually be able to discard dummy's remaining diamond loser on a long club. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nc|at|There would be no problem if clubs were 3-2, but what if that suit broke 4-1? |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ss|nt|It looked obvious to continue with the @SA, |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|sa|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|h6|at|but if Michael discarded on this trick, I might be in trouble if the clubs were 4-1. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


hs|ss|at|Richard would take his @SJ on the next round |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|s4|pc|sj|pc|s6|pc|h7|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


pc|h9|hs|ns|at|and lead another heart to force dummy's second last trump. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|d3|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


hs|ns|nt|I would then have to use dummy's last spade to draw Richard's remaining trump |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|st|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and, unless Michael was squeezed on this trick (this would happen if he had been dealt 1444 distribution), I would be unable to make my contract if the @CJ10xx was on my right. |

ls|sc|ls|nd|up|43|hs|wc|hs|ec|nt|As I said, none of this was necessary as the clubs were not divided 4-1 (and perhaps this distribution was unlikely to begin with as I suspect that Richard would have led his singleton club if he had been dealt the hand you see above). Still, it was a much more fun hand to play than the 6@D that I went down in on this week's first deal! |
