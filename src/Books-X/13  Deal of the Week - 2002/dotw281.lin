sk|s|nt|We will present this deal as Poland's ^*BMichal Kwiecien^*N, South, saw it. Kwiecien and partner ^*BJacek Pszczola^*N, reigning World Open Pairs Champions, faced ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N and ^*BTor Helness^*N of Norway (who ended up winning the 2002 Cap Gemini) when this deal was played. These are 2 of the very best pairs in the world. Get ready to see how bridge is supposed to be played.|

mb|1D|mb|P|mb|3D|an|Weak raise|mb|D|mb|p|mb|?|
nt|Helgemo, East, dealt and opened 1@D (playing strong 1NT and 5-card majors). Kwiecien passed and Helness raised preemptively to 3@D. Pszczola came in with a takeout double and Helgemo passed. What call do you think Kwiecien made as South? Neither side was vulnerable and IMP scoring was being used.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Kwiecien make?^^4H|mb|4h|hs|sh|nt|Kwiecien chose to jump to 4@H. Obviously 3@H and 4@H are the only reasonable calls here and we like Kwiecien's decision. It is too dangerous to play double in this position as a "balance" (that is, simply competing for the part score). Pszczola's double should carry that message of "possible game interest opposite a hand that could not act over 1@D". |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|Given that Pszczola rated to have game interest, Kwiecien had a very good hand for the bidding. Kwiecien would not need much more than he actually had to make a non-vulnerable 1-level overcall (as some other player with these cards did in the Cap Gemini). As such, it was up to him to put the partnership into game. 3@H would not get the job done.|

hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Helness led the @D2 (3rd and 5th best) and Kwiecien probably wished that he had bid only 3@H when he saw the dummy. There was a lot of work to do in both spades and clubs (especially since Helgemo rated to have the @SA). Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
