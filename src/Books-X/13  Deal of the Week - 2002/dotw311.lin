^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 311 - August 26, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I am proud to report that this week's deal was played by my partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, in an early round Spingold match at this year's ACBL Summer Nationals in Washington DC.

The 2002 World Championships are being played now in Montreal, Canada. So far my results in this tournament have been exceptionally poor, but hopefully Brad and I will do well in the World Open Pairs (which started August 25). As you will understand when you see how well Brad played this week's deal, I hope I have a lot of opporunties to be the dummy in this event!

Even if my lack of success at this tournament continues, I expect to have plenty of interesting deals from Montreal to report in upcoming ^*BDeals of the Week^*N!

The big news so far from Montreal is that my friends ^*BBill Gates^*N and ^*BSharon Osberg^*N played in the World Mixed Pairs. Bill held a press conference (about bridge) in Montreal which took place in a large room full of cameras and reporters. I had never seen anything like this at a bridge tournament before - the media tends to ignore even the biggest bridge tournaments.

Bill said a whole bunch of great things about bridge in front of the cameras. As a result, the game received a lot of positive media coverage all over the world. This is exactly the sort of advertising that bridge needs - a highly respected and very famous person telling the world about his love for our remarkable game. Thanks Bill!

On this web page, there is a story about Bill in Montreal and links to 2 video clips. These video clips (which were shown on TV across Canada) contain scenes from Bill's press conference and interviews with bridge players in Montreal (unfortunately some of these do not have a very good sense of marketing). I am interviewed briefly in both video clips as well.

The process of getting interviewed in front of a camera is interesting. The interview generally lasts about 20 minutes and the reporter spends all of this time asking you questions. Frequently the same question is asked several different times (sometimes in a slightly different way). All of this is condensed to 10 seconds or so and it can be amusing to see which 10 seconds of the 20 minutes appears on the air.

sk|s|hs|sh|nt|In this week's deal I opened 1@C as North with neither side vulnerable. Brad, South, responded 1@H with his promising hand and I raised him to 2@H. We sometimes raise here on hands with 3-card support, but I would estimate that in our style my 2@H would deliver a 4th trump about 80% of the time. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sc|mb|3C|at|Brad continued with 3@C, a natural and forcing bid in our partnership. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|sd|ls|sc|mb|3d|nt|West now came to life with 3@D. What was going on? West could not bid over 1@H, but he was willing to bid 3@D now, without the @DAKQ! West couldn't have a lot in the way of high cards so he had to have a lot of shape. Brad could be reasonably certain that West had been dealt a very distributional 2-suiter with spades and diamonds. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sd|nt|Is that what West's 3@D "should show"? |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|I have no idea as I cannot imagine having a hand that I would want to bid this way - I would always act on the first round with any hand that was willing to commit to the 3-level now. Moreover, I do not believe in testing partners to figure out what kind of hand I am "showing" for an "impossible" sequence like pass and then 3@D.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|nt|This was passed around to Brad. My pass suggested that I had a minimum hand without "offensive orientation". I would have bid 3@H if I had a minimum hand with good offense and, if I had been dealt a maximum hand, I would bid something other than 3@H over West's 3@D.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|sh|mb|3N|
nt|Brad's mass of high cards suggested that 3NT would be easy. His weak hearts (combined with a likely bad break in that suit) suggested that even 4@H might be in danger. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|I corrected 3NT to 4@H and East doubled. Brad thought about running to 4NT (and he also thought about redoubling), but he stood his ground. 4@H doubled was the final contract. |

ls|sh|pc|SQ|
nt|The opening lead was the @SQ and my dummy contained the balanced minumum that Brad had expected. I am sure that Brad was wishing that I had passed 3NT, but it was hard for me to do that. I was not looking at the @DAKQ (and I did not know that Brad had 17 HCP). I had no idea what West was doing when he bid 3@D. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|Still, it seemed like something funny was going on and I gave some serious consideration to passing 3NT. Fortunately, I had a very good non-hand-related reason to bid 4@H. We were winning the match by quite a bit and the opponents were running out of boards. I expected that they would play in 4@H at the other table and I did not want create a swing. |

at|East's @SA play confirmed Brad's suspicions about the nature of West's hand. West had been dealt 5 spades and at least 6 diamonds. |

hs|eh|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Down to just trump, East had to lead the suit. Leading the @H6 would allow dummy's @H9 to win the trick so East had to play back the @HJ or @H10. |
