^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 304 - July 8, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal comes from ^*BMasterpieces of Declarer Play^*N, a new book that was written by England's ^*BJulian Pottage^*N. ^*BMasterpieces of Declarer Play^*N consists of 72 declarer play problems that range in level of difficulty from advanced intermediate to very difficult. Every single problem in this book would make an excellent ^*BDeal of the Week^*N. For the purposes of this review I decided to pick one of the author's favorite problems.

I have been a serious student of bridge for over 20 years now and I have read dozens of collections of declarer play problems over the years. ^*BMasterpieces of Declarer Play^*N certainly qualifies as one of the best collections of deals that I have ever seen. ^*BJulian Pottage^*N has a gift for spotting new and interesting card play themes. The solutions to many of the problems in his recent book contain techniques that I have never seen before. I found this very refreshing as most books on declarer play consist mosly of deals with recycled themes.

Pottage also scores high marks in other areas. The solutions to his problems are well-written and his analysis is excellent. After each solution a short tip is provided, giving the user a key lesson point that he will be able to apply at the table. The problems are realistic and practical. These are not constructed problems - Pottage collected the deals that appear in this book from real life deals that he encountered during the past 15 years.

I believe that all fans of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will enjoy ^*BMasterpieces of Declarer Play^*N. I am happy to recommend this book without reservation to all players of at least intermediate level.

hs|sh|nt|In this week's deal East deals and passes. South opens the bidding with a weak 2@H, raised to 4@H by North. The opponents remain silent throughout and 4@H becomes the final contract. It is worth mentioning that the auctions that appear in ^*BMasterpieces of Declarer Play^*N are by and large equally simple. The reader does not have to get bogged down in complex or unrealistic auctions.|

sk||hs|wc|hs|ec|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|From the play to trick 1 it appears that West has led from a doubleton (or singleton) @C9. The defenders' clubs are not going to break 3-3 and the main focus of this problem is for the declarer to find a way to deal with his 4th round club loser. |

hs|wc|ls|wd|hs|nc|nt|Pottage does recommend that declarer surrender a club trick to East at trick 3, but not so much in an effort to ruff a club in the dummy or to start rectifying the count for a squeeze. The real purpose of this play is to sever the defenders' communication in the club suit. |

nt|The line of play that Pottage recommends is certainly elegant, but it does depend on West holding the @DQ. How likely is that? As Pottage points out, it is almost a sure thing. |

md|0,h7,,dq|hs|ed|ls|es|ls|ws|nt|If East had been dealt the @DQ in addition to the 10 HCP that he is known to have in spades and clubs, he would have opened the bidding. Even if East is a sound bidder, his @C10, spade length, and the favorable vulnerability would have been further incentive for East to open if he had been dealt the @DQ. |

ls|ed|md|0,dq,,h7|nt|Remember that this deal came from ^*BMasterpieces of Declarer Play^*N by ^*BJulian Pottage^*N, a book that I suspect you will enjoy. In my view, this deal is below average in terms of difficulty level for the book. Very few of the 72 problems are much easier than this one and several are much harder. Of course, judging the difficulty of a declarer play problem is partly subjective.|
