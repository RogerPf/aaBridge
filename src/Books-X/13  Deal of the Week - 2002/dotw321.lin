^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 321 - November 4, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is presented as a declarer play problem. This deal was played in the recent Las Vegas Sectional tournament where I was playing with ^*BRoger Bates^*N of Phoenix as my partner. Roger and I were on defense when this week's deal was played. Fortunately for us, the declarer did not find the sequence of plays that was required to make his contract. See if you would have done better.

I dealt as East and opened 1@H. You bid 3@C (a weak jump overcall) and, after Roger passed, your partner raised you to 5@C which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


pc|h5|at|Roger led the @H5 (3rd from even, low from odd^*N). Apparently your partner is confident in both the quality of your vulnerable jump overcalls and your skills as declarer. Don't let him down! |

at|Think about how you would continue as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|The position of the missing @SQ is critical and there is really no way to know which defender was dealt that card. Taking a simple finesse of the @SJ would not be unreasonable, but at the table the declarer decided that I was more likely to hold the @SQ than Roger was (because I had opened the bidding). He therefore tried to ruff out the @SQ in the hope of establishing dummy's @SJ.|

ls|ns|ls|sd|pc|sk|pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|s6|at|as both defenders followed small. |

pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|ns|pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|c7|pc|s7|at|but nothing exciting happened on this trick. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


mc|10|hs|sc|sk||at|You can now see the remaining cards. South tried running his clubs, but when no squeezed developed, he was down 1. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|sc|up|4|hs|ns|hs|es|nt|The actual declarer on this deal got off to a good start and he made the winning decision to play me for the @SQ. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|hs|eh|at|On the reasonable assumption that I had been dealt the 3 top heart honors, |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|Eh|hs|ns|hs|es|at|the declarer made a subtle mistake when he ruffed the @S9 in his hand. He would have made his contract if he had led the @SJ from the dummy instead of the @S9. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|pc|sj|md|0,s8,,d4|hs|es|nt|This strange play would work just as well if I had started with 3 spades to the @SQ (on this layout ruffing out my @SQ by leading the @S9 would also work) |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


md|0,d4,,s8|at|as it would against the actual layout of the cards. In either case I would cover the @SJ with my @SQ |

hs|ws|hs|ns|at|The effect of this play would be that Roger would become responsible for guarding dummy's @S9. |

ls|ws|ls|ns|hs|sc|nt|The declarer could then run the rest of his trumps to effect a a ^*Bdouble squeeze^*N. |

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|sc|at|When the last club is played, |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c8|hs|ws|hs|ns|at|Roger would have to keep his @S10 to prevent the dummy's @S9 from becoming a winner. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|hs|wd|at|He would therefore have to discard down to a singleton diamond |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d8|hs|ns|at|and the @S9 would be thrown from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|s9|hs|eh|hs|ed|nt|I would then be squeezed in hearts and diamonds. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|sh|at|I would have to retain my @HK in order to guard South's @HJ |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sh|hs|ed|at|so I would have to come down to a singleton diamond as well. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |

ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|dj|pc|dk|pc|da|pc|dq|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hs|nd|mc|11|at|and enjoy the 13th trick as dummy's remaining diamond would have become his 11th winner. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|nd|up|40|md|0,s2,,st|hs|es|nt|The line of play just described would not have worked if I had been dealt 4 spades headed by the @SQ and @S10. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|eh|at|There is another line of play that will allow the contract to make on this layout (and, in fact, whenever I have the @SQ and the 3 top hearts). |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|es|hs|nd|at|If declarer cashes the @DA early |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|da|pc|dt|pc|d7|pc|d4|

hs|sc|at|his last club |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c7|pc|s3|pc|d6|hs|es|hs|eh|hs|ed|at|would ^*Bstrip squeeze^*N me. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|eh|hs|ns|nt|Assuming that the declarer reads the position, I could not afford to unguard my @SQ |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ns|hs|sh|hs|eh|at|and a heart discard would be certain to be fatal. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sh|hs|ed|at|I would therefore have to discard my @DQ, |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|dq|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|eh|at|but South could counter by playing a heart to me. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|Sh|pc|hj|pc|ht|pc|d9|pc|ha|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


hs|es|hs|ns|mc|11|at|I would be endplayed into leading away from my @SQ and the dummy's @SAKJ would score the last 3 tricks. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ns|up|39|hs|es|nt|The main downside of playing for a strip squeeze on this deal is that the declarer has to guess my distribution in the endgame in order to succeed. Playing for the double squeeze instead requires no guesswork in the ending, but as was mentioned, that line would not work if I had been dealt 4 spades to the @SQ10.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ls|es|md|0,sq,,s2|hs|ws|hs|ns|nt|The simple line of playing Roger for the @SQ (and finessing the @SJ) is far from ridiculous. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


ls|ns|hs|eh|at|The heart length I showed in the bidding favors the @SQ being in Roger's hand, |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


md|0,st,,sq|ls|eh|ls|ws|hs|es|at|but the fact that I opened the bidding makes it more likely that any given missing honor card was dealt to me. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|This feels like one of those ^*BDeals of the Week^*N where I will get several e-mails, some trying to demonstrate which line is best and probably some suggesting other lines that I either did not consider or chose not to write about. I doubt that I will be confident of the right line of play even after this anticipated feedback, but I found this deal interesting nonetheless. I hope you did too!|
