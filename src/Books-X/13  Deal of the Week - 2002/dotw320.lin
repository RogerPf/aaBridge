^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 320 - October 28, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
During the past week I have had the pleasure of playing with ^*BRoger Bates^*N of Phoenix as my partner in the Las Vegas Sectional tournament. Roger has won several ACBL National events during the past 25 years or so. Also, he was a member of the American team that won the Rosenblum Cup World Championship in 1994. Besides being a great player, Roger is also a great partner and it was a lot of fun to play with him. Thanks Roger!

Roger demonstrated his skill as declarer in this week's deal (which is presented as a declarer play problem). This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

I am pleased to announce that my company (^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N) has reached a tentative deal with ^*BMatthew Ginsberg^*N that involves us taking over the distribution and technical support for ^*BGIB^*N. Our company sells over 20 software products for bridge, but ^*BGIB^*N is one of only 2 such products that we did not create ourselves. That says a lot about what we think of the quality of this product.

^*BGIB^*N is a program that plays randomly dealt hands against the user. There are dozens of programs with this basic function, but in my opinion, ^*BGIB^*N is really in a class by itself. This program occasionally makes poor bids or plays, but in general it plays a very solid game of bridge. What really makes ^*BGIB^*N special is that you don't have to play very many deals against it before you see it do something truly amazing. Bridge players of all levels of ability will find playing against ^*BGIB^*N to be challenging and entertaining.

^*BMatt Ginsberg^*N, the brilliant programmer who created ^*BGIB^*N, is a world class researcher in artificial intelligence. Along with that and the fact that he is also a fine bridge player and a serious student of the game, Matt is uniquely qualified to accomplish the daunting task of teaching a computer to play bridge at or above the level of human experts.

Matt's talents have attracted interest from other (non-bridge) businesses and this has made it difficult for him to provide ^*BGIB^*N customers with the level of service to which they have become accustomed. That is the reason why he approached my company with respect to taking over some of the aspects of the ^*BGIB^*N business. Matt will still have some time for ^*BGIB^*N, but his arrangement with ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N will allow him to focus his time soley on further improving ^*BGIB's^*N bridge skills.

The latest version of ^*BGIB^*N (version 6.1) has now been available for a few days. Version 6.1 represents the culmination of Matt's recent efforts to improve ^*BGIB^*N and my early tests indicate that the latest version of ^*BGIB^*N is indeed stronger than ever. You can find out more about ^*BGIB^*N and/or order a copy by clicking on the yellow rectangle below. You will be taken to the ^*BGIB^*N web site in a new browser window.

at|How would you continue from this point and why? |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|nd|nt|Roger had won 6 tricks already, but to come anywhere close to the 9 tricks that he needed, he was going to have to get to the dummy's diamonds |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |

sk||hs|ss|md|0,sa,,st|hs|ws|at|He could lead a spade toward the dummy himself and play West for the @SA. On the above layout this line would succeed. |

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|wh|at|he could cash 2 heart tricks (the 3rd and 4th winners for the defense), but Roger would be able to win the balance of the tricks to make his contract. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


up|3|hs|ws|ls|Wh|at|West could do better by ducking his @SA. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s5|hs|ns|At|Roger would then have to guess to put up the dummy's @SK in order to come to 9 tricks. I guarantee that Roger would have guessed the spades in the position shown above.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|es|md|0,sq,,sa|nt|Why would I being willing to offer a guarantee on what looks like a pure guess? After all, the dummy's @SJ would be the winning play if the spades were distributed as you now see above. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|The reason is that, as Roger demonstrated, when East has the @SA there is no need to play on the spade suit at all - you can get the defenders to do this for you. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


md|0,st,,sq|nt|Roger had good reasons (which we will see soon) to play East for the @SA. It did not matter that East actually had the @SQ as well as the @SA as you can see from the actual layout now shown above. Trying to guess the spades would not have been a success on this layout! |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


up|2|ls|es|ls|ns|ls|ws|hs|sc|hs|ec|
nt|Instead of playing on spades, Roger exited in clubs to East, |

hs|es|hs|ns|at|leaving him endplayed. A spade lead would let Roger win a spade trick in the dummy and end up with an overtrick. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ns|hs|ed|hs|nd|at|East did the best he could by playing a diamond to the dummy's stranded suit. |

pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|up|8|hs|ec|hs|sc|nt|Now for the big question: how did Roger know to exit in clubs, |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|sc|hs|es|at|essentially playing East for the @SA |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|es|md|0,sa,,st|hs|ws|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|instead of playing on spades himself (that is, playing West for the @SA)? |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|at|Roger knew that West had led from a 4-card heart suit headed by the @HJ. He also knew that West started with 3 diamonds (from his count signal) and 2 clubs. Therefore, West had been dealt 4 cards in spades. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|If West had been dealt the @SA, he might well have led that suit instead of a heart. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|es|md|0,st,,sa|at|Since West actually led a heart, Roger inferred that the @SA was more likely to be on his right, |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|es|hs|sc|Hs|ec|at|making his choice to exit in clubs the indicated play. That was certainly a good decision by Roger, but did you see how the defense could have come out on top?|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |

pc|cj|pc|d9|pc|h6|pc|c9|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|ec|at|Roger would not be able to throw East on lead with the @C2. The best he could do would be to cash his remaining club winners. |

mc|8|hs|ns|hs|es|at|Roger would be up to 8 tricks, but on the actual layout of the spades, there would be no way for him to come to a 9th winner. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


up|16|ls|ns|ls|es|hs|sc|hs|ec|nt|East's play of throwing away his sure club winner is known as a ^*Bgambit^*N. A gambit involves deliberately getting rid of a winner in order to gain 2 or more tricks. You don't see these plays very often at the table, but they appear on occasion in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N. See the 314th edition of this feature for another example of a gambit (that one was a gambit in the trump suit).  |
