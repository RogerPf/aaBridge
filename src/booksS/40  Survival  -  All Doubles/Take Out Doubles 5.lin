AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*N"The Versatile Double" by Howard |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/Doubles.txt^*N|CP||AT| and a five-page article which I saved a long time ago are the base for this synopsis/quiz supplement to Takeout Doubles tutorial. For years I have been collecting good bridge articles and links to good bridge web sites. I have been very careful to record the source and the author. Unfortunately, for a few including this 5-page article, I did not document the source. I would like to thank the author and beg forgiveness for not giving him/her the due credit. So before Howard's summary let me share with you the opening of the article.|

An all-too-familiar story. Ian asked me to try to clarify (for the benefit of all) which doubles are for take-out and which for penalties. To some extent, this is up to partnership agreement; but the following is a good general guideline."|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NIn this section, to outline that "good general guideline" there is a series of auctions to show whether the double is a takeout or not. But first Howard has a short review of the Takeout Doubles. You may find it repetitious but at my age repeating is the name of the game.|

^B@2^*BSchutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Takeout doubles have been in use since the invention of contract bridge. The intent of a takeout double is to convey the message that you have an opening hand and at least 4 card support for any unbid major suits and 3 card support for unbid minor suits. (If both majors are unbid, it is acceptable to have 3 card support for one of the 2 majors.)|

st||pn|Partner,,You,|md|2,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|Is it a takeout?|ah|Example 7|mb|1HP2HPPx|lb|*yIs the double a Takeout^^y|NT|^B@2
Another balancing takeout double. The purpose of a balancing bid or double is to avoid selling out too cheaply to the opponents. You need not have opening strength to make a balancing double -- you are essentially bidding both yours and your partner's cards. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Based on the auction, the high card strength is approximately even between the 2 sides. Therefore, even if you have as few as 7 or 8 points, you should consider making a balancing double (if you have the appropriate distribution), because partner likely has at least 9 or 10 points. Conversely, partner must also remember that you are balancing, and must not "punish" you for balancing by overbidding even with a relatively good hand.|

After a 1NT overcall the double by partner is for penalties. Therefore, a double by either (you or your partner) after a natural 1NT opener or a 1NT overcall is for penalty. To think about it there is no suit which can be taken after a double. -:)|

Double is correct. This is a textbook hand for making a takeout double -- opening strength, 4 card support for the unbid major, and 3+ card support for the unbid minors.|mb|x|

Pass. You lack 4-card spade support and you have 4-3-3-3 distribution. Despite what you may have heard, you are not obligated to bid even with an opening hand. If responder passes, your partner will be well positioned to balance, and he can and should do so even with only 8 or 9 points.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2   
You also may be able to back into the auction later. For example, if it goes 1H-P-2H-P-P-?, now you can make a takeout double. That is a "balancing" double which does not guarantee 4 spades (nor opening strength).|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Howard says, "I know I advocate the "bid early and bid often" style. But,in order to play that style, you need to have what you promise when you do bid. Granted, sometimes you are stuck, and have to lie a bit, but on this hand there is no reason to do so."|mb|p|

Double. You do have a 5-card diamond suit but you should not bid 2D. Double is a much better bid. It allows partner to comfortably compete with spades and clubs.|mb|x|

1@S. You should almost always overcall rather than double when you have a 5-card major—quality of course. Even when the auction starts with 1 of a minor, and you are 5-4 in the majors, you should prefer to overcall your 5-card suit rather than making a takeout double. This allows partner to more effectively compete.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
A double here strongly implies only 4 cards in spades. It is better to let partner know you have 5 spades. If the auction continues 1H-1S-2H-P-P-?, now you can make a balancing double, and partner can bid a minor if he has one (which will usually be the case). He will also be able to take a preference to 2S even with only 2-card support because he knows you have 5 spades.|mb|1s|

Double. You are a little short on points, but you have 4-card support for all the unbid suits. You want to let partner know he can compete with his best suit. Howard said, "Contrast this to Quiz H 1 where you should pass with 13 HCP but bad distribution. In competitive bidding, suit length is often more important than HCP."|mb|x|

Bid 1NT. This shows a balanced 15-18 (1NT overcalls are slightly different than 1N openers) with a heart stopper. As with an opening 1N, you should strongly prefer to overcall 1N when you have the appropriate hand. It gives partner a very precise description of your hand and allows him to be much more accurate in the bidding.|mb|1n|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
Even if we changed the hand slightly and gave you 5 spades and 3 diamonds, you should still overcall 1N rather than bidding 1S. A 1S overcall is much less precise about your strength. A 1N overcall is much more descriptive, particularly with a weakish 5-card spade suit.|

Here, with 19 HCP, you are too strong to overcall 1NT. You should double. If partner bids spades you should raise (raise 1@S to 3@S, raise 2@S to 4#S). If partner bids 2@C or 2@D bid 2NT. This "double and correct" shows a hand   that is too strong to make a direct 1N overcall. If partner bids 1N, which promises about 7-10 HCP, bid 3N.|mb|X|

In the modern style of bidding, many players would make a takeout double. You are slightly under strength and lack the defense that partner will expect. But your singleton heart is a very nice asset. Some might choose to pass because the hand does not contain opening bid strength. And that would be fine as well. If you choose to bid, double is much better than a 2@D overcall.|mb|P|

Bid 2NT (Jordan). You are showing 10+ points and 4 hearts. In this case, you have 13 points in support of hearts, so you have a game forcing hand. You intend to bid 4@H even if partner shows a weakish opener by only bidding 3@H.|mb|2n|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that you should not bid 4@H directly. A direct 4@H bid over the double (or even over a pass) would show a weak hand (less than 10 points) and 5 hearts. You are much too strong for that bid.|

The only time you should pass partner's takeout double is when you have great length and strength in the opponent's suit. That is when you convert the takeout double into a penalty double. But it is not a common occurrence.|mb|p|

NT|^B@2
South cannot pass with 16 HCP. What if North was dealt 4 cards in spades, or 4 hearts, or even 4 diamonds and few HCP. In that case South's hand would become 19 Dummy Points. That should be enough for a partial even if North has no points.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, South can double and legally inform North that he has an opener, he is short in clubs, he has at least 3 cards in unbid suits, and demanding a bid from North even with zero points unless West bids.|

North understands Partner's double is a takeout because:|

South has interesting hand. Partner is promising support in Spades, Hearts, and clubs. The hand is strong enough to force to game but which one—4@H, 4@S, or 3N. To find out South needs to bid 2@D cuebid of the opponent's suit asking partner to give you more information.|
