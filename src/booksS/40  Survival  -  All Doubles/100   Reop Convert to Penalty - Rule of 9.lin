bt||ht|b|CS|1|CP|4|HT|b|FP|3|at|^-{      Rule of 9      }
^-|CP||fp||at|
This explanation is from "Synopsis on Reopening Double" which you can find in either BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or in Howard's web site at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|. The link for the viewer is -|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/1eeqsw^*N|CP||AT|. Here we only outline the section explaining Rule of 9. BTW, Howard is not fond of "Rues" he tries to teach basic concepts rather than Rules.|

Responder after a Reopening Double has the following choices:
1. Bid his/her best suit. 
2. Raise the suit of the partner with a minimum of two or more but no less. 
3. Pass for penalty when holding length and defensive values in the suit of the opponent.|

Is there a rule of thumb or guideline for 
when to pass and    
    convert the Reopening Double to Penalty Double?

cs||FP||CP||NT|^B@2
Yes, some people use the Rule of 9--: |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/0tm7qw^*N|CP||AT|--while most experts dislike "Rules" in general and rely on experience. They go by the length and strength in the overcall suit and lack of support for partner.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

NT|^B@2
However, Rule of 9 can assist less experienced partner in arriving at the best action when forced to respond. The responder (North here) adds:

a. the level of the contract
b. the number of cards held in the suit of the opponent and 
c. the number of honors held in the suit of the opponent (this includes the 10).|

NT|^B@2
1. If the sum is |CP|8|AT|9 or more|CP||AT|, then the partner, North, should pass for penalty.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

8 or less|CP||AT|, then the partner, North, should bid on.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

For example, with clubs holding as is shown above Rule 9 says North should pass for penalty.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |

Because the sum is 9 (2 for contract level, 5 for number of cards held in opponent's suit, and 2 for number of honors held in that suit).|

st||RH||AH|Rule 9|AH|Example D|PN|You,,Partner,|sv|o|sk|n|md|1,,sj2ht54cA976dt765,|mb|1s2cppxp|NT|^B@2
In this example North should bid on as the sum is 7 (2 for contract level, 4 for the number of cards held in the overcalled suit and 1 for the number of the honor in that suit).|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not like the Rule of 9. One big flaw is, it does not take into account how many cards you hold in partner's suit.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a singleton or void in pard's suit, that says you are likely to pass if you have length in the opponent's suit. If you have 2, it is marginal to pass. If you have 3 in pard's suit, it is almost never right to pass, regardless of what the Rule of 9 says.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on hand C, I would pass with AQxx of clubs with shortness in spades. In fact, I might even pass with AQx of clubs. And I would pass with Axxx of clubs if short in spades.|
