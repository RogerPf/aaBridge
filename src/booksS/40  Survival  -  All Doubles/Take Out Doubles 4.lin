They are a pass, or an overcall, or a 1N bid, or make a takeout double. What is left is an attempt to learn the thought processes which experts use to make takeout doubles that "more often than not" give them good result—the small prints. Many items such as vulnerability, the position at the table, suit opened by the opponents and few others strongly influence experts in making a takeout double. There are agreements and of course there are differences. Before, we get to the list of small print let us have a short review of what we have learned.

^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In the modern style of bidding, many players would make a takeout double. You are slightly under strength and lack the defense  that partner will expect. But your singleton heart is a very nice asset. Some might choose to pass because the hand does not contain opening bid strength. And that would be fine as well.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHoward we changed the hand but kept the same number of HCP. Would you approve of a takeout double now. The hand has a good 4-card spade suits and partner most likely bids spades. Further, the hand has tolerance for diamonds and clubs. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The same argument that I made in the previous example applies here. I certainly think double is reasonable and consistent with the modern style. I would not object if any of my partners made a takeout double. But the same argument as to why I prefer pass applies to this hand as my original example. And I like my original example better, because 2D is another possibility some would consider. |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThere is another small print here, whether to add short points to the hand before a fit. Howard says, "I count dummy points once we find a fit, but initially just use starting points to decide whether or not I am strong enough to double."|

^*BThe Panel: ^*N|cp||at|2. Takeout double is the choice because the overcall is not "appropriate." The hand is worth 12+ points, has shortness in the suit the opponents opened, and has "generally acceptable" support for all unbid suits. That "generally acceptable" is what comes with many years of experience and requires the proverbial "judgement." You should look at the following examples.|

"Modern bidding theory has reduced the amount of values normally necessary by a King, in order to execute a Takeout Double. This reduction has lead to many more doubled bidding sequences and has resulted in the level of aggressiveness of the bridge player being raised considerably. However, many experts including Howard do not subscribe to this style. You will see his comments when he sees fit.|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|I would like to add a few word to the discussion. As the late, great Edgar Kaplan used to say: “Takeout doubles are meant to be taken out.” However, takeout doubles, as is the case for all doubles, can be “converted” for penalty. A very good (at least five cards) suit is needed to leave-in a 1-level takeout double. Let me show you my first example.|

^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|There are still teachers (not many, I hope) who preach that a double of a 4S opening is for penalty and that 4NT is for takeout. No! Do they get dealt lots of spades when their opponents open 4S? Bidding 4NT commits your side to the 5-level and should be done only with a very shapely 2-suited hand (at least 5-5). You don’t want to commit to the 5-level by bidding 4NT over their 4S on some 1-4-4-4 hand only to find partner with balanced junk. Doubling is a much more flexible action.|
