This short synopsis on Puppet Stayman is mainly based on an article from The Bidding Toolkit series by ACBL with Howard's supervision. The original link from ACBL listed on the article is no longer working. However, you can get it from this new |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/2z4zyw^*N|CP||AT| link.|

^B@2Puppet Stayman is a version of Stayman used in response to a 2NT opening bid. (20-21 hcp)

Puppet Stayman also applies when it goes 2@C-P-2@D-P-2N-P-3@C. (22+ hcp)

In general, whatever you play over a 2N opener, you also play over when opener bids 2@C and then rebids 2N. Usually, 2NT opener promises a balanced hand with 20 to 21 high-card points—with or without 5-card majors. 

Therefore, a 5-3 major suit fit could be missed if responder has only 3-card in the suit which opener has 5-cards. Puppet Stayman is intended to remedy that problem. Let us look at  a few examples. 


In all examples the opponents are silent.|

Now let us consider what should responder bid after opener's 3@D rebid. Responder still is in dark about opener's holding in one or both major suits. Again examples.|

With a fit for responder’s major, Opener bids that suit at four level, ensuring that the strong hand declares. For example:|

Responder need to get into the habit of asking about opener’s major suit holdings even when he has only three cards in hearts or spades. For example:|

The same would be true if you change the spades suit with heart suit. In that case you bid 3@C and if opener bids 3@H you would be glad to bid 4@H.|
