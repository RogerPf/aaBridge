^-|HT|d|va|4|CP|8|AT|^c@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because Marty Bergen adds lots of extra points for length, shortness, and high card quality, the ranges of hands are upgraded when you are deciding how good your hand is. So, using Marty Bergen's methods:|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


CP|8|AT|
^D@2^Y@3- a 6-9 Dummy Points hand is a weak raise;|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|
- a 10-12 Dummy Points hand is considered a limit raise;|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |

AT|^D@2
- a 20+ Starting Points hand is a maximum opener. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


CP||AT|

^c@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, to bid game (majors), you need at least 26 Total Points, not 25. To bid small slam, you need at least 33 Total Points between the two hands. Again, remember, because Marty Bergen adds many upgrades, you have to upgrade the number of points you need to bid game or slam.|

^-|HT|d|cp||AT|
^c@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the bidding, if you determine that the partnership's combined point count is 33 or more, you know that you are in the slam range. However, 33 points by itself is not sufficient to bid slam.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

Upon opening carefully listen to partner's response and count the total value of the partnership before further bidding. As opener, your hand falls into one of 3 ranges:|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

- a minimum opening hand, is |CP|8|AT|13-16 Declarer Points|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


CP||AT|
- a medium opening hand is |CP|8|AT|17-19 Declarer Points|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


CP||AT|
- a maximum opening hand is |CP|8|AT|20+ Declarer Points|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


CP||AT|

As responder, your hand falls into one of 3 ranges:|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

- a minimum response is |CP|8|AT|6-9 Dummy Points|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


CP||AT|
- an invitational response (such as a limit raise) is |CP|8|AT|10-12 Dummy Points|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


CP||AT|
- a maximum response is |CP|8|AT|13+ Dummy Points.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


CP||AT|

With a maximum response, you must force to game. Note that until you find a fit, you use Starting Points to evaluate your hand. Once you find a fit, you use the Declarer and Dummy addon points. Therefore, your hand can increase in value (and hence change which range it belongs to) once a fit is established. |

On the other hand, If both partners have medium hands, you are in the slam range since 17 + 17 = 34, And, if partner opens (which shows at least 13 Starting Points), and you have 20+ Dummy Points, you are in slam range, since 20 + 13 = 33. |

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


CP||AT|

The other thing you have to make sure is that you do not have 2 losers off the top.  We all know some form of Blackwood, which allows us to check to make sure we are not missing two Aces. Obviously, if we are missing two Aces (assuming no voids) we cannot bid slam, even if the combined hands have 33 points or more. However, we might only be missing one Ace and still not make slam. That is because we might be missing both the A and K in one particular suit, and neither partner has a singleton.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

So, in order to bid slam, we have to make sure we have "|CP|8|at|control|cp||at|" in every suit. We can either have |CP|8|FP|2|at|FIRST ROUND CONTROL|cp||FP||at| or |CP|8|FP|2|at|SECOND ROUND CONTROL|cp||at|.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

FIRST ROUND CONTROL |CP||FP||AT|means we can take the first trick when a suit is played. That means we either have the |CP|8|FP|2|at|ACE|cp||FP||at| or a |CP|8|FP|2|at|VOID|cp||FP||at| in the suit.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

SECOND ROUND CONTROL |CP||FP||AT|means we have the |FP|2|AT|KING|FP||AT| or a |FP|2|AT|SINGLETON|FP||AT| and that the opponents cannot take the |FP|2|AT|FIRST TWO TRICKS|FP||AT|. They may take the first trick, but we can take the second trick.|

PG| ***** 38 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|^c@2^Y@3That is done by using a convention known as "|CP|8|FP|2|at|CONTROL BIDS|cp||FP||at|" which work as follows:|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


FP|2|AT|

Once a game force is established, if one of the partners bids a suit other than trumps, that is showing a control, |FP||at|For example, suppose the auction goes |HT|r|AT|

{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp?|at|} |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


HT|S|AT|^n@2^Z@3
Although that does not strictly establish a game force, once the 1@S bidder makes another bid, the partnership is committed to game. Because you are already at 3@S, so any other bid takes you past 3@S, you must go to at least 4 spades. Now, on that auction, the 1@S bidder knows that opener is showing 17-19 Dummy points.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


HT|X|AT|
^C@2^Y@3So, if he has 16 points or more, slam is likely, since 17 + 16 = 33. On the other hand, if responder has 13 or a bad 14, slam is not likely, because your side does not have 33 points. |

PG| ***** 43 ***** |


HT|I|cs|6|at|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sppp|at|}|HT|h|at|^n@2^z@3In this auction South is indicating less than 8 or so points and passes. South knows game is unlikely, since the combined hands do not have 26 points.|

HT|n|AT|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp4sppp|at|}|HT|m|AT|^N@2^z@3With 8 to a bad 14 responder (South) simply bids 4@S, game, since slam is unlikely. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|

However, if slam is likely, then responder can bid a new suit. And, if you play control bids, that new suit is what is known as a "control bid", showing first or second round control of that suit. Therefore, in the next auction,|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


HT|u|AT|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp4c|at|}|HT|t|AT|^N@2^z@3the 1@S bidder is showing first or second round control of clubs and interest in slam.|

{            Control Bids            }
^-|HT|d|CP|8|AT|^c@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rules for control bids are as follows:|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|
Most importantly, you bid your cheapest control first. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|So, in the next auction,|

FP||CP||HT|J|cs|6|AT|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp4d|at|}|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


HT|I|AT|^N@2^Z@3the 1@S bidder (South) is denying first or second round control of clubs because if responder had first or second round control of clubs, then 4@C would be the bid. Thus, if in this auction the 1@C bidder (North) does not have first or second round control of clubs, then slam is not possible, because partnership has no club control. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


ht|O|AT|^CEven if South has the K of clubs and the A of diamonds, and the auction goes|HT|P|Va|6|AT|^c{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp?|at|} |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


HT|O|at|
^N@2^Z@3South must bid 4@C. If South bids 4@D, he/she is explicitly denying first and second round control of clubs. It is imperative that you bid your cheapest control, because if you skip a suit, that means you don't have a control. Any singleton K is a second round control due to the fact that it is a singleton.  The fact that it happens to be the King does not matter for the purposes of control bids.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@C. The first thing to do is count declarer points in this hand, which responded 1@S. You have 13 starting points (11 HCP + 2 length points) + 2 declarer points (1 for 6th spade, and one for 2 doubletons.) So you have 15 declarer points total, since partner has at least 17, you are in slam range. And 4@C is the correct bid, showing the first or second round control of clubs. The @CK is 2nd round control. You are basically worried about diamonds. Partner now can make a control bid. If partner bids 4@H, denying a diamond control, then you simply stop in 4@S, since you know you have 2 diamond losers. However, if partner bids 4@D, you can then bid Blackwood to make sure you have enough key cards to be in slam because you have hearts controlled.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|You can bid 4@D, which by implication shows a spade control. The reason it shows a spade control is because partner denied a spade control when he bid 4@C.  So, if you do not have a spade control, you know that you have 2 spade losers, and therefore must stop at 4@H. The point of control bids is to determine that you at least have second round control in all suits. If you know for sure that you lack second round control in a suit, then you should stop in game right away.  If partner explicitly skips a suit when making a control bid, that denies a control in that suit. If you also lack a control in that suit, you know you cannot be in slam.

In this auction (1@D-1@H-3@H-4@C), partner explicitly denied a spade control. Therefore, if you do not have a spade control, you must bid 4@H. On the other hand, if you do not bid 4@H, you must have a spade control.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|^*BThis hand is worth  |CP|8|AT|(18)|CP||AT|  Bergen Points.^*N and 4NT is the correct bid. As I said before you should not bid shortness as a control in partner's suit. You should only show high cards to partner. If partner bids a suit, and you make a control bid, you are explicitly showing the Ace or King, not shortness. So, 4N is the bid, since you know you have control of all suits. Let me repeat, shortness is partner's suit is not as useful as a high card, so Bergen feels that you should only control bid high cards in partner's suit. But, in other suits, shortness is helpful, so you can control bid shortness.|ht|i|va|6|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,1hp1sp3sp4cp4dp4n|at|}|
