^B@2^*BMarty Bergen (MB): ^*N|cp||at|Most players respond to Blackwood either In a traditional manner, RKC-30l4, or RKC-1430. 

^*BWhat's your preferred way to respond to Blackwood?^*N
I surveyed 60 players. Eight preferred traditional, eight said 3014 while 44 chose 1430. Wow! There is certainly no question as to what is "^*Bin^*N" these days.  So for the rest of these series, all RKC responses will be 1430. The concepts discussed, however, will also apply to those who use 3014. When I refer to RKC players, I am addressing adherents of both approaches. The basic principles behind all RKC responses are:|

^B@2^*BMB: ^*N|cp||at|I agree that you could not know about partner's extra trump. But he did. Had your partner shown extra length in trumps by bidding 5@S, you would have known, as well. When your side has 10-plus trumps, you do not expect to lose a trick to the trump Queen. Therefore, if the responder to 4NT knows that his side has ten trumps, he should respond as if he had the Queen. I'll bet you would have bid the grand then.|

^B@2^*BMB: ^*N|cp||at|Partner promises one ace. If he also has the @SQ or any five spades, you are happy to play in 6@S. But if he has four spades without the queen, 6@S does not rate to be a good contract. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMB: ^*N|cp||at|Keep in mind that when you are missing four cards in a suit, the suit will divide 2-2 less than 41% of the time. Therefore, what you would like to do is ask your partner, "Do you have the @SQ or extra trump length (at least five)?" Even if partner has five low spades, your chances of not having a spade loser when missing three cards in the suit are excellent.|

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMB: ^*N|cp||at|5@S denies the @SQ or extra length.
6@S shows the @SQ or extra length, and denies a side-suit king. If partner has the @SQ or extra length, he will control-bid his cheapest side-suit king:
5@H shows the @SQ or extra length and the @HK. It does not deny the @CK or @DK.
6@C shows the @SQ (or extra length) and the @CK. It denies the @HK. It does not deny the @DK.
6@D shows the @SQ (or extra length) and the @DK. It denies any other kings.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BTW, But many experts (including Howard) play that they bid 5N (rather than 6S) to show that hand. There is no disadvantage and occasionally it may allow partner to make some other bid below 6@S to try for a grand slam (such as showing a 2nd suit or a Q in partner's suit). |

PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMB: ^*N|cp||at|There is a way to know which side-suit king opener holds. The most efficient way to respond to 5NT is to control-bid your cheapest king. Thus, if opener has the club king, he bids 6@C, and you can bid a confident 7@S. If instead, partner has a red-suit king (or two), once he doesn't bid 6@C, you know that he doesn't have the @CK.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMB: ^*N|cp||at|That way, you can be sure that a grand slam could not be a good contract. Responding to 5NT by control-bidding your lowest king is sometimes referred to as the "improved king-ask." It can be the key to knowing whether you should bid a grand slam. Be aware, however, that the improved king-ask can get you too high when a suit other than spades is trumps. Therefore, many RKC players revert to just showing number of kings when spades is not trumps.|

^B@2^*BMB: ^*N|cp||at|Every RKC pair must decide which approach to use. Now I think it would be helpful to summarize what has been covered so far.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|

Responses of 5@C and 5@D when playing 1430:
* 5@C shows 1 or 4 key cards.
* 5@D shows 0 or 3 key cards.
These bids neither promise nor deny the trump queen (or extra length).|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT|

Responses of 5@H and 5@S
Both show 2 or 5 key cards.
5@H denies the trump queen (or extra length in the trump suit).
5@S shows the trump queen (or extra length in the trump suit).|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT|

Asking for the trump queen:
After a response of 5@C or 5@D, a bid in the cheapest new suit asks partner if he has the trump queen (or extra length in trump). If partner has the queen (or extra length), he control-bids his cheapest king. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|

Alternate ways of showing kings after 5NT:
Traditional number of side-suit kings.
Control-bidding cheapest king but only when spades are trumps. Some pairs have additional agreements here to learn about other kings as well. Control-bidding cheapest king regardless of which suit is trumps. If your cheapest king is in a suit that is higher-ranking than the trump suit, use your judgment on whether to show it.|
