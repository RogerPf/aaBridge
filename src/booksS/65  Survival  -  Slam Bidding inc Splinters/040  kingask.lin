^c@2Once the Blackwood bidder receives a response to 4N, he may then bid 5N as a King ask. There are two variations to the response. The variation I have a preference for is to respond with the number of Kings (obviously not counting the King of trumps). The scheme for response is similar to regular Blackwood.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

- 6@C = 0 Kings, 
- 6@D = 1 King, 
- 6@H = 2 Kings, 
- 6@S = 3 Kings. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

The other variation is "specific Kings". If you play that, then you respond with the cheapest suit in which you have an outside King; if you do not have an outside King, you bid six in the agreed upon trump suit. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

The main complication playing specific Kings is if your specific King is in a suit higher than the agreed upon trump suit. I play that you should respond with your specific King even in that case (partner needs to be prepared for that response), but some people play you can only respond with a specific King if it is in a suit lower than your agreed upon trump suit.|

Also, most people play that if the Blackwood bidder bids 5N as a King ask, that guarantees your side has all 5 key cards. That allows the responder, on rare occasions, to bid seven if he has a hand with an undisclosed feature that will most likely allow seven to make (such as a long solid side suit, which will generate many tricks).|

Let us look at an example.|

This link |CP|1|AT|^*hbridgewithdan.com/systems/RKC_Kantar.zip^*N|CP||AT| is to a zip file holding 27 documents by Mr. Kantar on everything you would like to know about Roman Key Cards, King and Queen ask for every possible bidding sequences with appropriate example hands. Here we only bring you a sample related to Specific King Ask (KA) though Howard is not so enamored with.|

^-{  The Specific King Ask (KA) After Major Suit Agreement  }
^-|HT|d|FP||AT|^B@2After a 4NT RKCB ask, a follow up bid of 5NT asks for specific kings in ascending order-clubs before diamonds- diamonds before hearts, etc. The king of the agreed suit is not included as it has already been accounted for.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

The 5NT bid, called the Specific King Ask (KA),  promises joint possession of the four aces as well as the KQ of the agreed suit. It is a grand slam try.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

In response to a KA, a return to the agreed suit denies a king. If the responder has one king, he bids that suit.  With two kings, the cheaper king is bid first. With three kings, responder jumps to 6NT (or bids a grand in the agreed suit knowing of a 9 card trump or longer).|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|

Anytime the responder can count 13 tricks, he needs not respond specific kings. Responder is allowed, even encouraged, to leap to a grand. Just do it! Showing a specific king denies the ability to count 13 tricks-and also denies three kings. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

At tournament bridge some partnerships use 5NT as an effort to find a specific king in order to land in 6NT instead of six of the agreed suit. They do not promise all four aces and the KQ of the agreed suit so 5NT is not necessarily a grand slam try. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|
 
We are going the other route. 5NT after 4NT  does promise joint possession of the four aces as well as the king-queen of the agreed suit and is a grand slam try. A few examples are next.|

At times KA bidder hears of one king, but is interested in another. To ask for a second king, the asker bids that suit. |
