^-|CS||CP||fp||ht|d|at|^B@24NT ace asking and the Roman Keycards conventions ignore Useful Space Principle (USP) |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/njm25w^*N|CP||AT| because bidding spaces are not allocated where it is most needed. At times using one of those conventions can throw partnership into an unmakable contract. For example if the agreed trump suit is clubs and 5@D is the response after 4NT call (0314 Blackwood ), partnership probably could be forced to play a doomed 6@C contract.|

^-|CS||CP||fp||ht|k|va|4|CS||CP||fp||at|^B@2
Useful Space Principle (USP) tells bidding theorists that bidding space should be allocated where it is most needed. Mr. Jeff Rubens conceived the Useful Space Principle which in a series of articles published in The Bridge World, from November 1980 through April 1981. Patterning along the USP he also designed Kickback Convention. It is to remedy the problems associated with regular Blackwood and Roman Keycard Conventions. Of course with a price which the proponent claim being negligible and manageable. |

In the Kickback Key Card Asking convention the 4NT bid is replaced by a 4-level bid one bid higher than the trump suit. For better explanation let us visit a recent mentoring session by Howard Schutzman. We will focus only on his explanation of the bidding at the table. |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the auction. The bids through 2@H are fine. Then West needs to decide what to do. West has a very nice hand, especially in clubs. A club slam is very possible. A heart slam might be possible as well, but with such nice clubs, it is likely clubs will play at least as well, and probably better.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The problem is, West has only 1 Keycard and if you use 4NT to ask about Keycards they could easily get too high if they are missing 3 Keycards.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
In general playing 2/1, 4@C over 2@H is not a good bid because the idea is to go slowly once a game force is established. That is why I had West take back her 4@C bid. Having said that, an expert might very well bid 4@C with West's hand, for the following reasons.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The message being conveyed by 4@C is ""Partner I have a self sufficient club suit and I am very interested in slam. Just start control bidding." West in particular is worried about spades. So a possible expert auction might start as 1@H-2@C-2@H-4@C. Then East would bid 4@D and West would bid 4@H. Finally, East, lacking a spade control would bid 5@C and the auction would end there.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If East bids 4@S over 4@H then West might venture 6@C, hoping that they have enough key cards. But it is very difficult to bid slam in a minor playing RKCB because the responses over 4NT might get the partnership too high which is why some expert partnerships play an ace asking convention known as "Kickback Key Card Asking or just Kickback"|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you played Kickback (and I don't suggest you do) then the suit one higher than the trump suit is used as the "Key Card Ask". Therefore, if you were in a potential club slam auction, 4@D would be the "Key Card Ask" playing kickback.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And (using 0314 scheme) the response steps would be: 
Step 1 4@H ^e= 0 or 3 Key Cards, 
Step 2 4@S ^e= 1 or 4 Key Cards, 
Step 3 4N  ^e= 2 Key Cards - no trump queen and
Step 4 5@C ^e= 2 Key Cards - with trump queen.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The following are Keycard ask for each trump suit:
4@D = "Key Card Ask" in clubs, 
4@H = "Key Card Ask" in diamonds, 
4@S = "Key Card Ask" in hearts, and
4N  = "Key Card Ask" in spades.|

^B@2As in any ace asking conventions the trump suit must be clearly established and both partners should be on the same page. Then, the suit used to initiate the call for Keycards, as is called ^*BKickback suit^*N, is the suit in rank above the agreed trump suit and the Kickback bid is four of the Kickback suit. When the trump suit is clearly established it is not important whether this suit has been previously bid by anyone on the table or not.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, I don't recommend you play it. I play it with one partner and often I am confused as to whether his bid is kickback, a control bid, or natural. We don't have a good record of bidding slams.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BMarilyn Hemenway: ^*N|cp||at| First, there are some disadvantages of using Kickback. One is that the now RKC asking bid is no longer available as a cuebid. Likewise, you can't splinter in that suit. For example, in the next auction:|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ht|k|va|4|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,1sp3cp4cp!4d|at|}|HT|k|va|4|at|^m@24@D would normally be a cuebid, showing an Ace or Void or a singleton in Diamonds. However, playing Kickback it would be Keycard Ask for clubs. One solution to cuebidding is to play that 4NT is the equivalent of a cuebid in the Kickback suit.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


HT|p|at|^B@2Kickback is not without problems though. Attempting to use Kickback instead of 4NT as RKC is guaranteed to give you and your partner many headaches and at least 10 bad or below average boards until you BOTH begin to remember it and use it to your advantage. ^*BHowever, don't knock it until you've tried it.^*N|

In each example the trump suit is established and partner bids the appropriate Key Card Ask (KCA). Responder counts his Keycards and responds using a scheme similar to steps used responding to 4NT if partnership was playing either RKC 1430, or RKC 0314--RKC 0314 scheme is more popular.

Some expert play 5N King-Ask, responses show specific Kings. However, Howard makes te following reommendation.
"You can play either specific kings or ## of kings. But I recommend ## of kings, because specific kings can get complicated. Suppose, for example, you are playing Kickback and hearts are trump and you decide to play specific kings. Partner bids 5@S (king ask in hearts) and you have the @SK and not the @CK nor @DK. Do you bid 6@S (thereby bypassing 6@H) or do you bid 6@H and not bother to show the @SK? Basically, there ares some hands where ## of kings works out better and other hands where specific kings works out better. But specific kings is more complicated and I always defer to simplicity if there is no advantage to extrra complexity."|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ht|x|AT|
^B@2Here the responses may look complicated but at a table responding to KCA becomes very simple as you easily count your aces or the Keycards, if any, and respond according to one of the the above scheme. Let us look at few examples. The trump suit is spades, partner is interested in slam by bidding the KCA, and we are following the 0314 scheme.|

The Key card Ask is always 4 of the next higher suit after the agreed trump suit; responses are in steps following the traditional Roman 
Keycard response structure, 0 or 3, 1 or 4, 2 or 5 without, 2 or 5 with:


^BTrump Suit                   ^kSpades   ^NHearts ^PDiamonds ^rClubs

With Key Card Ask, instead of a fixed suit-independent 4N ask, the Key Card Ask is 4 of the next higher suit after the trump suit. When the trump suit is Spades, 4N asks, and the responses are the familiar Keycard responses. When the trump suit is other than Spades, the adjusted Key Card Ask permits a full range of responses ending at 5 of the trump suit. Therefore, the contract level is never elevated purely because of system requirements. |
