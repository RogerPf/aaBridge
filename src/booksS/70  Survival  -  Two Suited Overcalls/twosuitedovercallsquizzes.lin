2C overcall is the best bid. You have great clubs suit. Further the hand is not a "Mini" or a "Maxi"-more than 10 and less than 16 points. You may be able to show your diamonds later. |

The hand is in the "Maxi" category but 2N seems to be the best bid. It is possible that partner may have a good hand and you end up in 5 or even six of one of the minors.|

North doesn’t have a good leads. For obvious reasons, North cannot use either clubs or diamonds for lead-you do not underlead an ace. A spade is not good either as that is one of the suits implied by East. So by process of elimination North chooses a trump. Leading trump won’t give much away and may prevent declarer from ruffing some of dummy’s spade losers.|

^-|fp||AT|^B@2Playing contracts from the short side, the side with the fewer trumps, requires a shift in perspective. From the West point of view, declarer has a lot of losers-one possible heart loser, five diamond losers and three club losers. It is usually better to view things from the side with the most trumps-East in this case.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


AT| Dummy has four spade losers, one heart loser, one diamond loser and one club loser. From that angle, a plan is easier to form.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


AT| Declarer has to eliminate two losers. Declarer plans to ruff one or two spades with the trumps in the West hand. Then declarer can lead spades to establish a trick through length if the missing spades are divided 4–3.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||fp|2|at|^-Suggested Defense
^-|fp||AT|^B@2The defenders do best to lead trumps at every opportunity to try to prevent declarer from ruffing spades in the West hand. If they don’t lead trumps, declarer may make nine tricks by ruffing two spade losers in the West hand and then establishing the fifth spade. If declarer takes the approach of trying to ruff diamond losers in the dummy, the defenders may be able to hold declarer to six or seven tricks. Declarer should get at least one spade trick, four heart tricks and one club trick.|

fp|2|at|^-Suggested Play
^-|fp||at|^B@2East has a lot of losers: one or more potential spade losers-if the suit doesn’t divide 2–2-five diamond losers and three club losers. East should look at establishing West’s hand as winners, rather than trying to eliminate all of those losers in the East hand. This is referred to as a dummy reversal.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|You will see Howard's comment on the dummy reversal later.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2
From the point of view of the West hand, there is only one loser in diamonds, one in clubs and a lot of heart losers. Declarer may be able to establish the heart suit by ruffing some of those losers. Suppose South leads club King and continues with another club, forcing dummy to ruff. Declarer should immediately play the HA and ruff a heart, starting to establish the suit. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East can then play the SA and a spade to dummy’s SK. The missing trumps divide 3–1, leaving declarer with a spade loser, but another heart can be led from dummy and ruffed with declarer’s last trump. With the defenders’ hearts dividing 3–3, dummy’s remaining hearts are now established as winners. Declarer can ruff a club in dummy and start leading the heart winners. North can ruff a heart and take a diamond trick, but the rest of dummy’s hand is all winners. Declarer makes the contract, losing one spade, one diamond and one club.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer is very lucky to actually make this contract. If the defenders’ hearts weren’t divided exactly 3–3, declarer would have to lose a heart trick. On the other hand, the defenders’ spades might have divided 2–2, leaving declarer no losers in that suit. The deal illustrates the power of a trump fit. North–South are unlucky to be unable to defeat 4S, even when holding 29 high-card points. Favorable distribution will often overcome a lack of high cards.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East must be careful to use the entries wisely. Suppose South leads a trump initially. East must win this trick with the SA, leaving the SK in dummy. East must immediately lead hearts before drawing any more trumps. After ruffing a heart, declarer uses West’s SK as an entry to dummy to ruff another heart. If declarer draws trumps right away or tries ruffing some of the club or diamond losers in dummy, establishing the heart suit may become impossible.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|A dummy reversal is when you ruff so many times in the long trump hand that the hand with shorter trump ends up having more trump. It is called a "dummy reversal" because typically dummy is the hand with short trump. On all these hands, even though the hand with the long trumps is often dummy, declarer should view the long hand as being the declaring hand, and his hand as dummy, for the purposes of establishing a way to play the hand. I might lead a trump against 4S, but it still makes.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT||
fp|2|at|^-Suggested Defense
^-|fp||at|^B@2Due to the lucky lie of the cards, the defenders can’t defeat the contract if declarer plays as previously mentioned. South should probably lead a trump initially, hoping to prevent declarer from ruffing heart losers, but that won’t work. The defenders also can try leading two rounds of clubs, forcing dummy to ruff and hoping to run dummy out of trumps before the hearts can be established. Again, declarer can still succeed with the lucky division of the hearts.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North–South’s best result is to push on to 4NT if East sacrifices in 4S. That’s difficult to do. North has no reason to expect East–West to make their contract. South, however, might think that the penalty derived will not be enough compensation for a vulnerable game and that the sixth club will produce a tenth trick in notrump. South, therefore, might bid 4NT to play. If North–South bid 5C, that contract can be defeated at least one trick if East gets a heart ruff.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East–West’s use of the Michaels Cuebid convention gives them an opportunity to compete for the contract. Without the intervention, North– South would make 3NT easily with an overtrick. Please click the forward arrow if you wish to play the hand double dummy again.|

^-|FP||AT|^B@2The deal involves careful handling of a suit combination when taking a finesse. As Howard always teaches, "You should not lead a high card unless you can afford to have it covered." Further, the clues from the auction should help declarer to locate the missing important cards-@DK and @CA. It is easy to do so when you can see all four hands. So to help out making your plan here we removed the East-West hand for a second. Make you plan based on East leading spade Ace. When done please move to the next panel for a review.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
Declarer has one spade loser, two heart losers, one diamond loser and two club losers. Declarer can do nothing about the spade loser. But declarer should be able to avoid a heart loser. The hearts might divide 3–3. Declarer could ruff a heart loser in dummy or declarer can discard one or more heart losers by establishing club winners in the dummy. Declarer might be able to avoid a diamond loser with the help of a successful finesse against the @DK. A club loser could be avoided by leading toward dummy and hoping to guess whether East holds the @CA or @CQ.|

Missing both the @DK and the @D10, declarer should lead a low diamond from dummy. This works, since West’s @DK appears, and declarer can draw trumps without losing a trick. It also would work if West started with the doubleton @DK. Declarer could finesse and then play the @DA. If West started with three diamonds including the @DK, there’s no way for declarer to take all of the diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2 
Having handled the diamond suit successfully, North needs to guess how to play the club suit. Since West opened the bidding and East has already turned up with the @SA, it’s more likely that West holds the @CA than East.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
Declarer’s best hope is that East started with the @CQ. North should lead the @C10, and if East doesn’t cover, take the finesse by playing a low club from dummy. Once this is successful, declarer should be able to take the rest of the tricks, losing only a spade trick and one club trick.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT||
fp|2|at|^-Suggested Defense
^-|FP||AT|^B@2After leading the @SA, East should switch to the singleton @H10. If West can win a trick before trumps are drawn, East may get a heart ruff. Declarer can draw trumps before letting West gain the lead, but may make a mistake. If declarer does successfully draw trumps and later leads the @C10, East should play low. Looking at the clubs in dummy, there’s nothing for East to promote by covering with the @CQ. If East plays low, declarer may misguess and play dummy’s @CK, hoping East started with the @CA. If declarer does that, East will eventually get a third trick for the defense with the @CQ.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
Note that North–South did well to get into the auction with their diamond fit by using the Michaels Cuebid convention. If East–West were allowed to play in 4S, they might make that contract. If North–South don’t lead trumps often enough, West might get away with losing only one heart, one diamond and one club trick.|

The only way to drop the offside singleton king on this hand – which goes against the odds if the suit is played in isolation – is to pay attention to the bidding.

Declarer is missing the @DK, and the normal play would be to take a diamond finesse, hoping that East holds the @DK. Declarer has some indications, however, that the finesse won’t work. West opened the bidding and there are very few high cards in the East–West hands. East has shown up with the SA. That leaves only 10 high-card points for West to hold - the @SQ, the @SJ, the @HA and the @HK - unless West also holds the @DK. It’s unlikely West would have opened the bidding. Further, East might not have made a preemptive raise to 4S with both the SA and the @DK. Everything points to West holding the @DK.|

Dear Billy,
A hand from a recent sectional has forced me to rethink my bidding. I held the hand as shown above and heard my RHO open 1S.|MB|1s|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


AT| At the table, my gut reaction was to bid 2S (Michaels), but I decided not to because it might confuse the partner I was playing with. Additionally, I think 2S is wrong because partner might bid 3H with nothing, and I’d have no idea whether to go to 4H. I considered doubling and correcting a club bid to a red suit because my hand seemed strong enough.|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I thought I needed a better heart suit to correct to hearts, however, and I feared losing the heart suit if I corrected to diamonds. Finally; I decided to overcall 2H on the grounds that if partner had enough for game with my hand, he would "protect" by making a bid. I could always bid diamonds later unless 2H was passed out.|MB|2h|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner didn’t know to protect, and 2H was passed out.|MB|PPP|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


AT| I made 11 tricks in hearts even though good defense should hold me to nine. Partner’s hand was as shown above.|MD|0,0,SQT85 HKJ7 D843 CK95,0|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A friend at another table doubled and corrected clubs to hearts and was raised to game. What would have been the better bid from partner: 3H (support with support, my preference) or 2NT, showing a stopper and at least 8 points?
 
 Back to the Blackbeard.|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Dear Blackbeard,
What you play and how you play it can influence your bidding decisions. When I play Michaels, I like to play that 3D by partner is an artificial good heart raise, but 3H is weaker. That approach would have alleviated your fear of not knowing the range of partner’s 3H bid. I like the Michaels bid the most, as you pointed out the flaws in the double.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On your actual choice of 2H, partner had the easiest raise to 3H ever; which shows about 7 to 9 HCP. So he clearly dropped the ball. 2NT should show more than 8 HCP as you suggest.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I like my partners to raise my two-level overcalls as if I had opened the bidding. Yes, I have good hands when I freely overcall at the two level. The biggest positive I see is that you weighed your options with great care.|
