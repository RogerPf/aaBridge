^-|HT|d|CP||FP||cp|1|AT|^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Understanding the Unusual Notrump (UNT) and Michaels Cuebids is easy. However, remembering the differences at the bridge table is a struggle for me. More importantly knowing when a NT is not Unusual or a Cuebid is not Michaels gets complicated though that knowledge is very critical. This tutorial is designed to lessen my struggle. You also may find it useful. |

What is an UNT?|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT| In general an immediate overcall of 2NT after an Opponent opens either a major or a minor is an Unusual NT-UNT.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT| I like the definition in Bridge Guys web site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/UnusualNoTrump.html^*N|CP||AT|,  "The Unusual Notrump is a conventional defense method designed to show two suited hands in competitive situations with one bid."|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT| The bid always shows the two lower unbid suits-at least five cards in each suit. Therefore, after one of a majors opening it always shows the |cp|1|at|two minors|cp||at|. And after a minor opening it shows |cp|1|at| heart and the other minor|cp||at|. Let's look at the four possible UNT bids by partner sitting North:|

With an appropriate hand 4NT is used as an UNT promising a hand with many points concentrated in both minors and not much in the suit bid by the opponents. Granted such auctions do not come by often. But, It is fun to know and use them when the occasion arrives. In all the following bidding examples 4NT promises both minors.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% WHEN A 2NT IS NOT UNT

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT    }
^-|cp|1|AT|
^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|So simply said, "An immediate jump to 2NT after a suit opening is unusual."|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT| Is there room for confusion? |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT| Of course there is.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT| If the partners are not on their toes and the issue has not been properly discussed then the question arises whether a NT bid is natural or unusual resulting in disaster.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT| Worse yet, in certain bidding sequences, even experts do not agree whether a NT bid is natural or unusual.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT| It gets really complicated because there are the 1NT and 2NT overcalls by unpassed or passed hands in direct or balancing seats. Just to make it more complicated the 1NT has different meaning depending whether it is an immediate overcall, an overcall by a passed hand or an overcall by a passed (or even unpassed) hand in a balancing seat.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

To have a better understanding of the complicated issue, first we like to present in part the summary section from the Bridge Guys web site and then look at Bergen's teaching followed with ^*IThe Unusual No Trump^*N by Alvin Roth. And finally to close the chapter with a detailed commentary by Howard Schutzman-our teacher and mentor. Explaining modifications to this conventional bid by other experts is outside of the scope of this work.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT| The good news, however, is that the complicated variations are rare. So fasten your seat belt as we are going for a rough ride.  First will be the summary from the Bridge Guys site.|

ht|n|at|"All of these guidelines may determine the employment of the Unusual Notrump and in deciding whether the Notrump overcall reflects which partnership agreement in the auction. Once again, it must be repeated that the vulnerability must be regarded at all times and the Unusual Notrump conventional defense method must not be used indiscriminately for any two-suited holdings. The requirements should be observed by the player, since the partner will otherwise slowly lose trust."|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |

". . . If you wish to include this feature, or any other feature, of the game of bridge in your partnership agreement, then please make certain that the concept is understood by both partners. Be aware whether or not the feature is alertable or not and whether an announcement should or must be made." |

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman    }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|In certain situations, which I will describe further below, you can overcall in NT to show some 2 suited hands. This convention is  known as the "Unusual NT". The reason it has that name is because, quite often, a NT overcall is natural and usually shows a strong NT. However, there are some situations where it is clear that the person who overcalls NT cannot have the "usual" balanced hand with the appropriate point count. In those cases, the NT overcall is deemed to be "Unusual".|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT|

I understand that here I should cover situations which may be vague or there may be two different interpretations of a certain NT overcall. So, let me briefly mention one special situation. If a partnership plays a strong club system, such as Precision, where a 1C opener is completely artificial, showing 16+ points and saying nothing about clubs, then 1C-2N shows clubs and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


AT|

This is in line with the general bidding principle that when the opponents make an artificial bid that says nothing about the suit bid, any bid that you make that could show that suit in fact does show that suit. Therefore, if a pair is playing a strong club system, then 1C-2C shows clubs. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT|

Another examples of that principle is that 1N-P-2D (transfer)-3D shows diamonds. Having said that, if a pair plays the "short club" (e.g 1C can be as few as 2 clubs), 1C is still natural (in that it usually shows club length), so 1C-2N still shows diamonds and hearts.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


aT|

One other controversial situation. A few weeks ago, there was a hand in one of my mentoring sessions where the bidding went 1D-P-P-?. The person in balancing seat had a balanced hand with 19 HCP and chose to bid 2N. At the table, I corrected her, saying that 2N there would be Unusual, showing clubs and hearts. Afterwards, a few of my students told me my correction was actually incorrect, and that the 2N bid indeed showed a balanced hand with about 19-21. Let us look at that board.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|After some research and consultation with Marty Bergen, I did find out that, indeed, 1x-P-P-2N, is now played by most experts as showing a balanced 19-21, so I retracted my correction.

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|Unfortunately, it can get rather complicated as to whether or not a NT overcall is natural or unusual. I will try and cover the common situations. But the general principle you should use is, assume a NT overcall is natural unless it is obvious it cannot be natural.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|

The most common situation where even a non-jump NT overcall cannot be natural is when the NT overcaller has passed originally. So, for example, if it goes P-P-P-1H-1NT that must be unusual. If the 1N bidder had not passed originally, then, as most of you know, a direct 1N overcall shows 15-18. However, since the 1N bidder passed originally, he cannot possibly have 15-18, so the NT overcall must be unusual. I play that the 1N bid there is kind of like a takeout double for the minors, and the 1N bidder only promises 4 cards in each minor (although they are often 5/4). With 5/5, I will usually still jump to 2N, as that is more pre-emptive.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT|

What about if the auction goes P-1H-P-P-1N? In that case, 1NT is not unusual. 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-14 by an unpassed hand. So, even with a passed hand, the 1N bidder could have a balanced 11 or 12 Therefore, the 1N bid in the balancing seat is still natural.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


AT| 

Some people play what is known as a Sandwich NT overcall. If the auction goes 1x-P-1y-1N and you play Sandwich NT, rather than 1N being strong, it is a weak takeout for the other 2 suits. I don't particularly recommend the Sandwich NT, as you can always make a takeout double in that auction. But if you want to play Sandwich NT, I have no strong objection.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|

Another common case -- I recommend you play what Bergen calls OBAR (Over Opponents Bid and Raise) 2N. If the opponents bid and raise a suit, then 2N is like a takeout double for the 2 lowest unbid suits. Thus, 1H-P-2H-2N shows clubs and diamonds. Again, I play it only promises 4 cards (but is typically at least 5-4).|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


AT|

One case that should be obvious as unusual NT, but may not be unless you think about it. If it goes 2C-2N, that must be unusual. Although it is theoretically barely possible for the NT bidder to have a 15-18 1NT type of hand, why would you want to play in 2N when you know your opponent has all of the rest of the HCP? So 2N there must be unusual. I am assuming, of course, that 2C is the usual strong artificial opening bid. Strong club systems use a 2C opener as showing 11-15 HCP with clubs. If you encounter an 11-15 2C opener, then 2N can retain its usual meaning of a balanced hand of 15-18 HCP.|

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|One final reasonably common situation where 2N is unusual even when it is not a jump overcall. And that is, a 2N bid is unusual over any natural strong NT by the opponents. Although it is possible for you to have a strong NT when an opponent has opened a strong NT, it would not be desirable to play 2N when you know an opponent is that strong. In general, you would be much better off defending. Hence, playing 2N as natural over a strong NT is not useful. But playing 2NT over 1N as showing at least 5/5 in the minors can be quite useful and pre-emptive.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT|

Those of you who play DONT might argue that since a 2C DONT bid shows clubs and another suit (which could be diamonds), there is no need to play 2N as unusual over a strong NT. However, just like 3-level DONT bid (e.g. 1N-3D) shows a long suit (despite the fact that you can make a DONT double with a 1 -suited hand), playing 2N as unusual even if you play DONT is useful as a pre-emptive tactic. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

A similar situation is 1N-P-2x-2N. That also is unusual. Since the 2x bid is always artificial (Stayman or a transfer), then 2N is unusual. Over a 2C, 2D, or 2H response to 1N, which show major suits, 2N shows 5/5 in the minors. Over 1N-P-2S-?, you need to be more careful. If the opponents are playing 4-way transfers, which means 2S definitely shows clubs, then 2N shows hearts and diamonds. However, if 2S is a transfer to either minor, then it makes no sense for 2N to show both minors, since you know you are getting a very bad break in at least one of your suits. The simplest solution is to play that 2N over such a 2S bid does not exist. Alternatively, you could play that it shows 5/5 in the majors, but my guess is partner will forget that so it is not worth the risk.|

With two-suited hands in the 10 to 15 points category you should overcall the higher ranking suit. You may get to bid your other suit later. For whatever reasons most partnerships play "Mini"/"Maxi" system.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT| 

The conventional wisdom also has it that the 5-5 or better distribution is very important rule that should not be ignored. I have read, "Do not bid UNT with either a 5-4 or 4-6 distribution. At best it can confuse our partner and at worst it can give you a minus in the range of 800 and higher." This is very true in UNT as partner is forced to bid at the three level. Nevertheless, some experts may not agree. On the other hand 6-5 hands are acceptable for UNT bids.|

Alvin Roth also has a very good point for the UNT bidders, "The Unusual Notrump has one thing in common with natural Notrump openings and direct 1NT overcalls. With normal 5-5 or even 6-5 patterns, you do not have to bid again to confirm your fine distribution and playing strength." |

"Partner heard you the first time. If he permits the opponents to play the hand in spite of your bid, do not overrule him; he is in a far better position to judge how far your side should compete than you are.

AT|

So any 2 Notrump immediate overcall signifies that the 2 Notrump bidder holds at least 5-5 distribution  in the two lower (lowest for the grammar purists). The point range should be 6 high card points plus, and should be mainly in the suits promised. Remember that the distribution will be your main weapon. Also, the number of Losing Tricks may be the determining factor.|

One important point should also enter in the analysis before responding. In most instances partner has made an unusual 2NT bid as a pre-emptive or as an obstructive bid. With all considered—outlined above—responder should choose one of the known suits as the trump and make a further obstructive bid by jumping in that suit. Occasionally responder may look for a game or even slam contract with an excellent fit. But don't push it.|

NT||sk|n|lb|*bWhat would be a reasonable bid by North?^^4c|mb|4C|NT|^B@2
With an excellent fit in clubs and a partial fit in diamonds, North should be willing to compete in clubs. Based on the Law of Total Tricks, North should be willing to go to at least the four level even with unfavorable vulnerability. However, he can make a more aggressive bid of 5C particularly with favorable vulnerability. This could pressure East/West to overbid and go down.|
PG| ***** 261 ***** |


AT| Let us look at a probable hand for North.|
PG| ***** 262 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
North/South fare fine in a club contract—making 10 or 11 tricks.|
PG| ***** 263 ***** |


AT| Let us give East/West random hands as shown now|MD|0,st983 hkjt6 dkt2 cq6,0,saqj2 haq9854 d93c5|mb|4hppp|AT| and see how would they do in 4@H contract. Click the forward arrow if you wish to find out.|
pg| ***** 264 ***** |


pf|y|at| You can play this hand double dummy if you wish. You also can make other random hands for East/West. Most likely they should take at least 10 tricks in a heart contract.|
PG| ***** 265 ***** |


AT| Because, in this hand East/West most likely bid on and reach 4@H which makes, therefore, an initial 5C by North would be a more obstructive bid.|

Now let us make North bid 5C|ub|5|mb|5cppp|at| and see how would they do in 5C contract. Again you can play this hand double dummy. But make sure you do not click the forward arrow. With existing distribution 5C most likely is down 1. However exchange the @DK with one of East diamonds and 5C will make with a finesse in diamonds.|

North's options are 3H, 3NT, 5C, and 5D. None of these is perfect.|

AT| 3NT is practical as it is much easier to make 9 tricks than 11.|
PG| ***** 272 ***** |

The answer is a qualified "Yes." Now South is in the balancing position with 9 HCP, East/West have stopped at the two level, North probably has some of the missing strength.|

2NT by South is unusual in the pass out position even though he didn’t jump to 2NT on the first round. Partner should remember what Bergen says, "It is unusual if it is reasonable to be unusual." South cannot be expected to have much strength to bid a natural 2NT.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts play the following. Double of 4S is takeoutish, although on many hands responder can decide to pass, hoping that setting 4S will work best, especially if responder has a balanced hand. 4NT is a 2-suited takeout with 5/5, but not necessarily the minors. The 4N bidder could be 5/5 in C/D, C/H, or D/H. Therefore, responder should never bid 5H, and only bid 5D if he is willing to play 5H if partner is 5/5 in C/H. You can decide whether or not to put this in the movie. (I play this, btw, and it has worked well and does come up frequently enough that it is worth playing, unlike the lottery, lol).|

South can bid either 2N or 4N-depending on his partner and vulnerability. 4N is a more pre-emptive, more obstructive, cleaner bid and reflects the hand better. It quickly takes partnership to either 5C or 5D where they belong. BTW, in this position 1N overcall by South is natural showing a balanced hand showing 15 to 18 points.|

^B@2Some players only use Michaels on weak hands (<10 points) and strong hands (around 16+ points). With the intermediate two-suited hands with 11-15 points, they bid the higher-ranking suit first and hope they can rebid the other suit at their next turn. Other players simply use Michaels on hands of all point ranges, believing that it is more important to immediately show shape than to only show one suit first and then hope the auction allows them to show the other suit and their 11-15 point range. By inference "points" = HCP.|

You have a weak distributional hand. Your options are Pass or 2C (Michaels cuebid showing the two majors). Most experts use Michaels cuebid to show a relatively weak, distributional hand with at least five cards in each major. The better the distribution, the more aggressive they can afford to be. This would be an acceptable hand to cuebid 2C if non-vulnerable. A fit at the two level is highly likely even if North has only a doubleton heart. |mb|2c|

The distribution is perfect for a Michaels cuebid—5/5 in the major suits. However, the hand is strong (mid range) for a Michaels cuebid. You do not have to bid Michaels cuebid just because you have the fitting distribution. Make a simple overcall of 1S.

The Michaels cuebid is used either with a relatively weak distributional hand (mini if you will) with both majors or a very strong hand (maxi) with both majors. For hands in mid range you should use a simple overcall. Of course there are experts who play Michaels with intermediate-strength hands as well.|

After a minor opening—1c here—Michaels convention should be only used with at least five cards in each major. Bidding 2C (Michaels cuebid) can get you in a poor contract as Partner might have to bid 2S with only two or three spades. So, either Pass or make an overcall of 1H, showing your five-card suit. Most experts also insist that you should have 5/5 distribution.|

You have a two-suited hand but you cannot use the Michaels convention. A cuebid of opening one of a minor ALWAYS shows both major suits, not spades and diamonds. Make a simple overcall of 1S, the higher-ranking of the two five-card suits. It is possible that you can show your other suit next. |

Bid 2D. The immediate cuebid of the opponent’s minor suit promises both majors and in most instances a weak hand. This bid at favorable vulnerability doesn’t carry much risk since North is likely to have a fit with at least one of the major suits. It carries more risk when vulnerable. This is very similar to the earlier example where the bidding was 1C-2C|

A cuebid of 2H would show a two-suited hand with spades and an unspecified minor suit.

^-|HT|d|fp||CP||at|^B@2^Z@3When the opponent on your right opens the bidding at the one level in a suit, you can use the Michaels cuebid convention to show a two-suited hand:

• A direct cuebid of opener’s minor suit shows both major suits.

• A direct cuebid of opener’s major suit shows the other major and an unspecified minor suit. 

• You need at least five cards in both suits and either a relatively weak distributional hand — less than the high-card strength for an opening bid — or a very strong distributional hand with which you intend to bid again after hearing partner’s response.|

PG| ***** 404 ***** |


AT|  

If partner shows hearts and spades and you hold  @SKx  @Hxx, do not make the mistake of bidding spades, thinking that your king will make spades a better trump suit. If you get doubled in 3S, there is no turning back, whereas if you bid 3H, you can run to spades if necessary. With 3-card support, though, you bid whichever one is better. You need not worry as much about being doubled with a known 8-card fit.|
PG| ***** 405 ***** |


AT|

If the Michaels cuebid shows an unspecified minor and you have no interest in his implied major, bid 2NT to ask which minor he holds. If partner has clubs, he bids 3C. If he has diamonds, he bids 3D. Partner can also raise the cuebid suit as a game or slam try. For example: |

PG| ***** 409 ***** |


AT| Some experts insist on a 5-5 distribution for a Michaels cuebid. Others, however, would bid a Michaels showing both majors like 1C-2C or 1D-2D with 5-4 or 4-5 in majors because responder is not forced to bid above the two level. Bergen said he did it—at least then :).|
PG| ***** 410 ***** |


at|^B@2

However, when the bidding goes 1H-2H (spades and an unknown minor suit) or 1S-2S (hearts and an unknown minor suit) the minor suit is unknown and the responder is forced to the three level. This may not be as dangerous as the case in 1H-2H situation when the responder can bid 2S—with spade support. In this case some people play that a 4 card spades suit is permissible as partner has only to bid at the two level in support of Spades. Otherwise, if responder does not wish to play in the major then he bids 2NT to get partner to bid his minor—at the 3 level.|

AT| North puts the partnership in a known eight-card major suit fit at the cheapest possible level—South is promising at least five cards in each major—the Law of Total Tricks is on North side.|
PG| ***** 417 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By bidding a Michaels cuebid, South generally has less than the values for an opening hand. Therefore,  North has no reason to look for game, particularly with such a run-of-the-mill fit with South’s suits and weak hand.|
PG| ***** 418 ***** |

North should not consider bidding clubs. South is unlikely to have more than one or two clubs.|
PG| ***** 419 ***** |


MB|P|NT||sk|s|lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^p|mb|pp|NT|^B@2 
South should Pass. South has already described the hand with the Michaels cuebid and has nothing more to say. Howard always says, "Do not make a redundant bid." If North shows no interest in reaching game, South should not bid again. Please note that North was forced to bid.|

It is hard to say whether North can make the contract or not—there are a lot of losers. In a good day North may even make the 2H. However, down one—the most likely result—is not a poor result. East/West have good possibilities in clubs or diamonds partscore. Further they can be pushed into reaching 3NT and going down 1.|

The correct bid is 2H. The double by West removed the obligation for North to bid as South can bid again. But 2H clearly shows the preference by North. A Pass gives the information that North either has equal preference for hearts and spades or lack of preference and South should choose the trump. This can get them in trouble if South bids 2S. Further, it gives away too much information to East/West. |

In this situation Pass is acceptable. North has equal preference for both majors and can leave the decision to South. |MB|P|
PG| ***** 442 ***** |

However, as in previous example, North can quickly bid 2H and prevent East–West from doubling whichever suit South picks. Sometimes, you do your best in a difficult situation.|

With what he knows North has three bids—2H, 3H, or 4H. North has at least a 9-card fit with one of South’s majors and South announced having less than the values for an opening bid. Therefore, 2H is a conservative bid but it doesn’t take advantage of the obstructive value of the Michaels cuebid—East/West still have plenty of room to find their best contract.|
PG| ***** 448 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand North can get really aggressive and either cuebid the opponents’ suit or outright bid 4H—that is really being obstructive. However, that may be going too far out on the limb. What else is left you may ask.|
PG| ***** 449 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A jump to 3H seems the best of both worlds. This is a pre-emptive raise—obstructive enough—, however, South could bid game with exceptional distribution—descriptive and is supported by the Law of Total Tricks. Now let us assume that our North bids 3H and East passes.|

MB|3hP|sk|s|lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^p|NT|^B@2

To bid accurately opposite a Michaels cuebid you need to visualize how the two hands will fit together.

His options are 2@S, 3@S, or 4@S. But which one is the best—safest and most obstructive? Let us review what North knows in addition to what he has in his hand.|
PG| ***** 487 ***** |


AT| North/South are not vulnerable, have at least a 9-card fit in spades, and the opponents have more than twice the number of HCP—28.|
PG| ***** 488 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2@S is a conservative bid and could not get the partnership in trouble. However, the opponents holding the majority of points and being short in spades would not allow North/South to play in 2@S contract. To follow the same line of reasoning the bid of 3@S is not really that much better.|
PG| ***** 489 ***** |


AT| The real aggressive bid is a jump to 4@S by North.|MB|4S|
PG| ***** 490 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the Opponents can either pass and let North/South play the 4@S—highly unlikely, double the 4@S or outbid North/South in minors.|
PG| ***** 491 ***** |


AT| For the sake of making the point let us consider that East doubles the 4@S followed by three passes.|MB|xPPP|
PG| ***** 492 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With only North/South hand open we can say that the contract easily is down two or three even if the hearts and spades are divided favorably. So, the best case scenario is that North/South might escape for a penalty of 300 points, since they are non vulnerable. And that could be a great sacrifice.|
PG| ***** 493 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With 28 HCP and a few added distributional points East/West surely can make game or even slam contract—3NT, 5C, or 5D. Next, you will see East/West hands randomly produced. To try more random hands you can remove the North/South cards from the deck and randomly divide the remaining cards between East/West and play the hands with a partner.|
PG| ***** 494 ***** |


AT| Let us take a look at randomly produced East/West hands as shown above. You can play the hand double dummy if you wish.|pf|y|md|0,s32ht3dak976ck762,0,satha42dqjt8caqjt|
pg| ***** 495 ***** |


pf||NT|^B@2
There are many parts to this bidding sequence. By jumping to 4S, North is risking a loss of 300 or 500 points hoping that East–West will misjudge the situation. East–West could double for penalty while they could get more for bidding a game, or settle for game when they can make a slam, or bid slam when they can make only game.|
PG| ***** 496 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, East/West may not know whether North’s jump to 4S is based on values with the expectation of making the contract and let North/South escape undoubled in a 4@S contract. We should mention that Howard considers 4S by North an overbid and continues, "Maybe if EW vul, NS not, it is ok. 3S is fine."|

Many experts who use the Michaels cuebid play that a 3D-a direct cuebid-is showing both major suits. In this situation, South is promising a reasonably good hand with both major suits. When the opponents open with a pre-emptive bid, you should not also make a pre-emptive bid. |

Please note, however, that there are experts who play a cue bid over a pre-empt only promises a good hand with two suits, other than the bid suit.

A cuebid of 3C will likely be interpreted by partner as the Michaels cuebid convention, showing both major suits. This bid is superior to 2H overcall.|

Although knowledge of conventions is helpful,

   one does not need to know all about those conventions which the partnership doesn't employ.

^B@2The defense against Two-Suited Overcall Bids outlined by Marty Bergen probably is the easiest to learn. Therefore, this section is based mainly on Marty Bergen's ^*IBetter Bidding With Bergen Volume II^*N : |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||AT|. However, in preparing this section we also have borrowed from Mr. Roth's teaching—they are very similar. This section has two parts:|

^-|FP||ht|d|cs||cp||AT|^B@2The defense against two-suited overcall bids is ingenious and based on the difference between constructive and competitive bidding principles. In competitive bidding, after an overcall, the Opener's partner loses a few of his original options—bids—but gains a few new ones—cuebid of the overcalled suit. For example when the bidding goes 1S-(a suit overcall)- now responder can cuebid the overcalled suit to show a limit raise or better.|
PG| ***** 569 ***** |


AT|

The same principle is used in defense against two-suited overcalls except in most instances, there are two suits known. For that reason defending against UNT overcalls is the easier of the two because a jump overcall in Notrump by the opponent ^*Balways^*N shows the two lower unbid suits. Because the two suits are known, therefore, there would be two new cuebids available for the Opener's partner. They are the cuebid of the ^*Blower unbid suit shown^*N (cheaper cuebid) and the cuebid of the next unbid suit, or ^*Bthe higher^*N of the two if you will (the ##2 cuebid).|
PG| ***** 570 ***** |


AT|

Each cuebid has a specific meaning and along with the other options available to the Opener's partner form a solid line of defense. Before we look at a few examples a schematic diagram of the defense lines is in order. It is from Mr. Roth's paper. In our diagram we will start with 1H-2N-? bidding. You may find it repetitious but trust me it would not hurt to have it pounded in our brains—at least mine :).|

In this bidding cycle and the previous one Opener's partner loses the 1N, 2C, 2H and 2S bids because of the 2N overcall. However, all the other bids starting from 4D on are available and they maintain their original constructive meaning.|

PG| ***** 581 ***** |


AT|

Number of experts (Howard included) play the cheaper and ##2 cuebids the other way. That is the cheaper cue bid shows the cheaper suit (e.g. 1S-2N-3C shows hearts) and the higher cue bid shows the higher suit (e.g 1S-2N-3D shows spades).|
PG| ***** 582 ***** |

The rest of bids available to the Opener's Partner have the same meaning as in the competitive bidding. We will deal with those shortly.|

Double = Interest in doubling one, or both, minors. Opener is invited to double any bid by the partner of the UNT bidder or pass it back to partner.|
PG| ***** 590 ***** |

Utilizing these methods enable Opener's partner to locate four-four major suit fits, use transfers when responder has a long major, and penalize 3C or 3D when he has good defense against the minors. |

Mr. Roth continues, "These treatments and adjustments will help you to counter the Unusual Notrump, but you will not find in them a master key to unlock all doors, for there is none. In practice, we attempt to follow the sage advice of ^*IS. J. Simon^*N, the great British expert, whose philosophy in competitive auctions was '^*BGet the best result possible; not necessarily the best possible result.^*N' We have found that this is good advice in resolving just about all bridge problems."|

^*BMM^*N :|CP||AT|Now it is time to go through a few exercises. To show the effect of a two-suited overcall on the competitive bidding, the first few are standard responses to the opening bid without the overcall. In all we would be playing SAYC as the 2/1 is off after a jump overcall. |

Now let us look at the bidding cycle when the RHO overcalls 2NT—Unusual Notrump (UNT).|UB|2|mb|2N|an|5 clubs and 5 diamonds|
pg| ***** 606 ***** |


at| Clearly, now all the bids through 2NT which you had when the RHO passed disappear—Pass still is an option of course. On the other hand, two cuebids-based on the two suits implied by the overcaller-the two lower unbid suits-become available. In the case of 1S opening the two suits implied are clubs and diamonds. Thus, the responder (you sitting South) gains ^*Bthe 3C cuebid—the cheaper cuebid—and 3D cuebid or ##2 cuebid.^*N|
PG| ***** 607 ***** |

With those two new bids let us take a look at all the options for Opener's partner. Also a few of the previous bids have different meaning. Let us look at them.|

For defense against a UNT overcall when the two suits implied are known we can use the simple guideline just outlined. Case closed.

Many experts are concerned about the "or better" portion as the partnership may be faced with 4-1 trump break.|
PG| ***** 632 ***** |


AT| After a one suited overcall Howard plays the limit raise or better to show 4-card support. But he adds, "Since the 2N takes up so much bidding room, the cuebid here only promises good 3-card support. This is in contrast to 1S-2D-?, where there is much more room to bid a new suit, and I prefer that 3D shows 4+ card support."|

This is a good example of the "or better" for 3C-the cheaper cuebid-showing a limit raise or better, Even if partner signs off in 3S, you would bid 4S. Of course you may consider the Law of Total Tricks and bid 4S right away. There is only a small probability that you may miss slam in spades.|

What is the double by Opener's partner (you) in this bidding sequence?|
PG| ***** 650 ***** |


AT| It conveys the same message as a redouble after a takeout double. The doubler shows 10+ points. It also tends to deny support for opener's suit (because then responder would bid #1 cue bid) or length in the 4th suit (because then responder would bid #2 cue bid).|
PG| ***** 651 ***** |


NT|^B@2

^-|FP||ht|d|cp||cs||AT|^B@2The defense against Michaels cuebids is very similar to defending against UNT particularly when both suits are known. However, there may be confusion when one of the two suits promised by the overcaller is unknown (1H-2H and 1S-2S). The good news, however, is that Opener's partner-in most instances-can bid at the 2 level-a lower level than when UNT is the overcall bid. |
PG| ***** 672 ***** |


AT|

First, let us look at the defense guideline for when both implied suits by the overcaller are known such as in 1C-2C and 1D-2D—(hearts and spades in both cases). The defense is similar to when the overcall is an UNT. To illustrate, therefore, we will use the same pattern as we did for explaining the defense against the UNT. |

2C overcall is the best bid. You have great clubs suit. Further the hand is not a "Mini" or a "Maxi"-more than 10 and less than 16 points. You may be able to show your diamonds later. |

North doesn’t have a good leads. For obvious reasons, North cannot use either clubs or diamonds for lead-you do not underlead an ace. A spade is not good either as that is one of the suits implied by East. So by process of elimination North chooses a trump. Leading trump won’t give much away and may prevent declarer from ruffing some of dummy’s spade losers.|

^-|fp||AT|^B@2Playing contracts from the short side, the side with the fewer trumps, requires a shift in perspective. From the West point of view, declarer has a lot of losers-one possible heart loser, five diamond losers and three club losers. It is usually better to view things from the side with the most trumps-East in this case.|
PG| ***** 823 ***** |


AT| Dummy has four spade losers, one heart loser, one diamond loser and one club loser. From that angle, a plan is easier to form.|
PG| ***** 824 ***** |


AT| Declarer has to eliminate two losers. Declarer plans to ruff one or two spades with the trumps in the West hand. Then declarer can lead spades to establish a trick through length if the missing spades are divided 4–3.|

NT||fp|2|at|^-Suggested Defense
^-|fp||AT|^B@2The defenders do best to lead trumps at every opportunity to try to prevent declarer from ruffing spades in the West hand. If they don’t lead trumps, declarer may make nine tricks by ruffing two spade losers in the West hand and then establishing the fifth spade. If declarer takes the approach of trying to ruff diamond losers in the dummy, the defenders may be able to hold declarer to six or seven tricks. Declarer should get at least one spade trick, four heart tricks and one club trick.|

^-|fp||at|^B@2East has a lot of losers: one or more potential spade losers-if the suit doesn’t divide 2–2-five diamond losers and three club losers. East should look at establishing West’s hand as winners, rather than trying to eliminate all of those losers in the East hand. This is referred to as a dummy reversal.|
PG| ***** 842 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|You will see Howard's comment on the dummy reversal later.|
PG| ***** 843 ***** |


NT|^B@2
From the point of view of the West hand, there is only one loser in diamonds, one in clubs and a lot of heart losers. Declarer may be able to establish the heart suit by ruffing some of those losers. Suppose South leads club King and continues with another club, forcing dummy to ruff. Declarer should immediately play the HA and ruff a heart, starting to establish the suit. |
PG| ***** 844 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East can then play the SA and a spade to dummy’s SK. The missing trumps divide 3–1, leaving declarer with a spade loser, but another heart can be led from dummy and ruffed with declarer’s last trump. With the defenders’ hearts dividing 3–3, dummy’s remaining hearts are now established as winners. Declarer can ruff a club in dummy and start leading the heart winners. North can ruff a heart and take a diamond trick, but the rest of dummy’s hand is all winners. Declarer makes the contract, losing one spade, one diamond and one club.|
PG| ***** 845 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer is very lucky to actually make this contract. If the defenders’ hearts weren’t divided exactly 3–3, declarer would have to lose a heart trick. On the other hand, the defenders’ spades might have divided 2–2, leaving declarer no losers in that suit. The deal illustrates the power of a trump fit. North–South are unlucky to be unable to defeat 4S, even when holding 29 high-card points. Favorable distribution will often overcome a lack of high cards.|
PG| ***** 846 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East must be careful to use the entries wisely. Suppose South leads a trump initially. East must win this trick with the SA, leaving the SK in dummy. East must immediately lead hearts before drawing any more trumps. After ruffing a heart, declarer uses West’s SK as an entry to dummy to ruff another heart. If declarer draws trumps right away or tries ruffing some of the club or diamond losers in dummy, establishing the heart suit may become impossible.|
PG| ***** 847 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|A dummy reversal is when you ruff so many times in the long trump hand that the hand with shorter trump ends up having more trump. It is called a "dummy reversal" because typically dummy is the hand with short trump. On all these hands, even though the hand with the long trumps is often dummy, declarer should view the long hand as being the declaring hand, and his hand as dummy, for the purposes of establishing a way to play the hand. I might lead a trump against 4S, but it still makes.|
PG| ***** 848 ***** |


NT||
fp|2|at|^-Suggested Defense
^-|fp||at|^B@2Due to the lucky lie of the cards, the defenders can’t defeat the contract if declarer plays as previously mentioned. South should probably lead a trump initially, hoping to prevent declarer from ruffing heart losers, but that won’t work. The defenders also can try leading two rounds of clubs, forcing dummy to ruff and hoping to run dummy out of trumps before the hearts can be established. Again, declarer can still succeed with the lucky division of the hearts.|
PG| ***** 849 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North–South’s best result is to push on to 4NT if East sacrifices in 4S. That’s difficult to do. North has no reason to expect East–West to make their contract. South, however, might think that the penalty derived will not be enough compensation for a vulnerable game and that the sixth club will produce a tenth trick in notrump. South, therefore, might bid 4NT to play. If North–South bid 5C, that contract can be defeated at least one trick if East gets a heart ruff.|
PG| ***** 850 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East–West’s use of the Michaels Cuebid convention gives them an opportunity to compete for the contract. Without the intervention, North– South would make 3NT easily with an overtrick. Please click the forward arrow if you wish to play the hand double dummy again.|

^-|FP||AT|^B@2The deal involves careful handling of a suit combination when taking a finesse. As Howard always teaches, "You should not lead a high card unless you can afford to have it covered." Further, the clues from the auction should help declarer to locate the missing important cards-@DK and @CA. It is easy to do so when you can see all four hands. So to help out making your plan here we removed the East-West hand for a second. Make you plan based on East leading spade Ace. When done please move to the next panel for a review.|
PG| ***** 862 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
Declarer has one spade loser, two heart losers, one diamond loser and two club losers. Declarer can do nothing about the spade loser. But declarer should be able to avoid a heart loser. The hearts might divide 3–3. Declarer could ruff a heart loser in dummy or declarer can discard one or more heart losers by establishing club winners in the dummy. Declarer might be able to avoid a diamond loser with the help of a successful finesse against the @DK. A club loser could be avoided by leading toward dummy and hoping to guess whether East holds the @CA or @CQ.|

Missing both the @DK and the @D10, declarer should lead a low diamond from dummy. This works, since West’s @DK appears, and declarer can draw trumps without losing a trick. It also would work if West started with the doubleton @DK. Declarer could finesse and then play the @DA. If West started with three diamonds including the @DK, there’s no way for declarer to take all of the diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 874 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2 
Having handled the diamond suit successfully, North needs to guess how to play the club suit. Since West opened the bidding and East has already turned up with the @SA, it’s more likely that West holds the @CA than East.|
PG| ***** 875 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
Declarer’s best hope is that East started with the @CQ. North should lead the @C10, and if East doesn’t cover, take the finesse by playing a low club from dummy. Once this is successful, declarer should be able to take the rest of the tricks, losing only a spade trick and one club trick.|
PG| ***** 876 ***** |


NT||
fp|2|at|^-Suggested Defense
^-|FP||AT|^B@2After leading the @SA, East should switch to the singleton @H10. If West can win a trick before trumps are drawn, East may get a heart ruff. Declarer can draw trumps before letting West gain the lead, but may make a mistake. If declarer does successfully draw trumps and later leads the @C10, East should play low. Looking at the clubs in dummy, there’s nothing for East to promote by covering with the @CQ. If East plays low, declarer may misguess and play dummy’s @CK, hoping East started with the @CA. If declarer does that, East will eventually get a third trick for the defense with the @CQ.|
PG| ***** 877 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
Note that North–South did well to get into the auction with their diamond fit by using the Michaels Cuebid convention. If East–West were allowed to play in 4S, they might make that contract. If North–South don’t lead trumps often enough, West might get away with losing only one heart, one diamond and one club trick.|

The only way to drop the offside singleton king on this hand – which goes against the odds if the suit is played in isolation – is to pay attention to the bidding.

Declarer is missing the @DK, and the normal play would be to take a diamond finesse, hoping that East holds the @DK. Declarer has some indications, however, that the finesse won’t work. West opened the bidding and there are very few high cards in the East–West hands. East has shown up with the SA. That leaves only 10 high-card points for West to hold - the @SQ, the @SJ, the @HA and the @HK - unless West also holds the @DK. It’s unlikely West would have opened the bidding. Further, East might not have made a preemptive raise to 4S with both the SA and the @DK. Everything points to West holding the @DK.|

Dear Billy,
A hand from a recent sectional has forced me to rethink my bidding. I held the hand as shown above and heard my RHO open 1S.|MB|1s|
PG| ***** 908 ***** |


AT| At the table, my gut reaction was to bid 2S (Michaels), but I decided not to because it might confuse the partner I was playing with. Additionally, I think 2S is wrong because partner might bid 3H with nothing, and I’d have no idea whether to go to 4H. I considered doubling and correcting a club bid to a red suit because my hand seemed strong enough.|
PG| ***** 909 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I thought I needed a better heart suit to correct to hearts, however, and I feared losing the heart suit if I corrected to diamonds. Finally; I decided to overcall 2H on the grounds that if partner had enough for game with my hand, he would "protect" by making a bid. I could always bid diamonds later unless 2H was passed out.|MB|2h|
PG| ***** 910 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner didn’t know to protect, and 2H was passed out.|MB|PPP|
PG| ***** 911 ***** |


AT| I made 11 tricks in hearts even though good defense should hold me to nine. Partner’s hand was as shown above.|MD|0,0,SQT85 HKJ7 D843 CK95,0|
PG| ***** 912 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A friend at another table doubled and corrected clubs to hearts and was raised to game. What would have been the better bid from partner: 3H (support with support, my preference) or 2NT, showing a stopper and at least 8 points?
 
 Back to the Blackboard.|
PG| ***** 913 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Dear Black Beard,
What you play and how you play it can influence your bidding decisions. When I play Michaels, I like to play that 3D by partner is an artificial good heart raise, but 3H is weaker. That approach would have alleviated your fear of not knowing the range of partner’s 3H bid. I like the Michaels bid the most, as you pointed out the flaws in the double.|
PG| ***** 914 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On your actual choice of 2H, partner had the easiest raise to 3H ever; which shows about 7 to 9 HCP. So he clearly dropped the ball. 2NT should show more than 8 HCP as you suggest.|
PG| ***** 915 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I like my partners to raise my two-level overcalls as if I had opened the bidding. Yes, I have good hands when I freely overcall at the two level. The biggest positive I see is that you weighed your options with great care.|

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
