^-|HT|c|va|4|fp||CP||at|When the two suits promised by partner are known, with equal length in both of the cue-bidder's suits, bid the cheapest one of the two suits shown. The level would be based on how good the support for the suit is.|
PG| ***** 0 ***** |


AT|  

If partner shows hearts and spades and you hold  @SKx  @Hxx, do not make the mistake of bidding spades, thinking that your king will make spades a better trump suit. If you get doubled in 3S, there is no turning back, whereas if you bid 3H, you can run to spades if necessary. With 3-card support, though, you bid whichever one is better. You need not worry as much about being doubled with a known 8-card fit.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

If the Michaels cuebid shows an unspecified minor and you have no interest in his implied major, bid 2NT to ask which minor he holds. If partner has clubs, he bids 3C. If he has diamonds, he bids 3D. Partner can also raise the cuebid suit as a game or slam try. For example: |

ht|L|va|8|at|^m@2In the auction shown on the left 3C shows game interest in hearts or spades. The Michaels cuebidder is expected to bid his cheapest suit at the cheapest level.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


HT|Q|va|4|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|1c2cp3cp3h|at|}|ht|Q|va|4|at|In this case, 3H with a weak hand of around 0-10 points. All other bids show at least 10 points and are game forcing.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT| Some experts insist on a 5-5 distribution for a Michaels cuebid. Others, however, would bid a Michaels showing both majors like 1C-2C or 1D-2D with 5-4 or 4-5 in majors because responder is not forced to bid above the two level. Bergen said he did it—at least then :).|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


at|^B@2

However, when the bidding goes 1H-2H (spades and an unknown minor suit) or 1S-2S (hearts and an unknown minor suit) the minor suit is unknown and the responder is forced to the three level. This may not be as dangerous as the case in 1H-2H situation when the responder can bid 2S—with spade support. In this case some people play that a 4 card spades suit is permissible as partner has only to bid at the two level in support of Spades. Otherwise, if responder does not wish to play in the major then he bids 2NT to get partner to bid his minor—at the 3 level.|

%%%% THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS FROM ACBL
HT|B|AT|^B@2In many respects The Michaels cuebid is similar to Weak Two Bid—descriptive and obstructive. In responding to Michaels cuebid, responder should strain to either get the partnership the best contract or prevent the opponents from reaching their best contract. The best place to learn such dynamics would be at the table. So let us review a few examples. As before you will be quizzed.|

MB|P|lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^2h|MB|2H|NT|^B@2
Yes 2H is the correct bid. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT| North puts the partnership in a known eight-card major suit fit at the cheapest possible level—South is promising at least five cards in each major—the Law of Total Tricks is on North side.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By bidding a Michaels cuebid, South generally has less than the values for an opening hand. Therefore,  North has no reason to look for game, particularly with such a run-of-the-mill fit with South’s suits and weak hand.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North should not consider bidding clubs. South is unlikely to have more than one or two clubs.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


MB|P|NT||sk|s|lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^p|mb|pp|NT|^B@2 
South should Pass. South has already described the hand with the Michaels cuebid and has nothing more to say. Howard always says, "Do not make a redundant bid." If North shows no interest in reaching game, South should not bid again. Please note that North was forced to bid.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT| Next let us see how North/South would do with random hands for East/West.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sk||md|0,skq2h965dk876ct62,0,st643ha4dajt9caj7|NT|^B@2
It is hard to say whether North can make the contract or not—there are a lot of losers. In a good day North may even make the 2H. However, down one—the most likely result—is not a poor result. East/West have good possibilities in clubs or diamonds partscore. Further they can be pushed into reaching 3NT and going down 1.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


MB|3D|lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^p|NT|^B@2
Bid Pass. West’s bid relieves North from the obligation of responding to the Michaels cuebid. As you may recall the Michaels cuebid is forcing unless there is an intervening bid. North can pass and choose to defend.|mb|pp|

The bidding is as shown above.|MB|1D|MB|2D|mb|x|lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^2h|MB|2H|NT|^B@2
The correct bid is 2H. The double by West removed the obligation for North to bid as South can bid again. But 2H clearly shows the preference by North. A Pass gives the information that North either has equal preference for hearts and spades or lack of preference and South should choose the trump. This can get them in trouble if South bids 2S. Further, it gives away too much information to East/West. |

MB|P|sk|n|lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^2h|MB|2H|NT|^B@2
The correct bid is 2H. North should bid 2H, the cheapest available bid in one of South’s known suits. Even if North forgets that Michael Cuebids are forcing North has to make some bid or the partnership will be playing in the opponent’s suit! Not recommended :).|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


mb|p|sk|s|nt||lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^p|mb|p|NT|^B@2 
South has only one bid and that is Pass. He already pushed his partner to bid and has no information on partner's strength.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


sk||AT| And now he can tell he may have gotten the partnership too high. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North/South would do poorly in 2H. Please note that the Michaels cuebids don’t guarantee good contracts when competing. On occasion the partnership gets into a bad contract. But more often than not the contracts are fine.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT| Let us change the bidding and have West double.|ub|4|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


sk|n|MB|X|lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^p|NT|^B@2
In this situation Pass is acceptable. North has equal preference for both majors and can leave the decision to South. |MB|P|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


sk||AT| South will have to pick one of the major suits—the longer major if South has more cards in one major than the other, or the stronger major if South has equal length in one of the two suits, or toss a coin if both majors are similar.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, as in previous example, North can quickly bid 2H and prevent East–West from doubling whichever suit South picks. Sometimes, you do your best in a difficult situation.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|I am sure you would like better hands for responding to a Michaels cuebids. So we can look at a few more cheerful situations:). Let’s turn to the more positive situations where North does have a good fit with at least one of South’s suits.|

The bidding is as shown above.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^3H|NT|^B@2
With what he knows North has three bids—2H, 3H, or 4H. North has at least a 9-card fit with one of South’s majors and South announced having less than the values for an opening bid. Therefore, 2H is a conservative bid but it doesn’t take advantage of the obstructive value of the Michaels cuebid—East/West still have plenty of room to find their best contract.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand North can get really aggressive and either cuebid the opponents’ suit or outright bid 4H—that is really being obstructive. However, that may be going too far out on the limb. What else is left you may ask.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A jump to 3H seems the best of both worlds. This is a pre-emptive raise—obstructive enough—, however, South could bid game with exceptional distribution—descriptive and is supported by the Law of Total Tricks. Now let us assume that our North bids 3H and East passes.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


MB|3hP|sk|s|lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^p|NT|^B@2
South has about what North expected—a typical hand for a Michaels cuebid. Therefore, has nothing more to do but Pass and hope to get the partnership to a reasonable contract while keeping East–West out.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |

If South and West pass, |MB|pp|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


sk||AT| how will North fare in a 3H contract?|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT| The 3H can be made if the spade losers can be held to one trick barring suits divide very badly, North should be able to have only one spades loser, one diamond loser and two heart losers — making exactly 3H. On the other hand East/West should be able to take at least nine tricks in diamonds or clubs.|

MB|P|lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^4h|MB|4H|NT|^B@2
To bid accurately opposite a Michaels cuebid you need to visualize how the two hands will fit together. North's assets are: eleven high-card points but two of them—the @DQ—are practically worthless, at least a nine card fit in hearts, and good help in the other major promised by South. So a jump to 4H would be a reasonable gamble.|

How will North/South fare if there are three passes after the 4H bid?|MB|PPP|

His options are 2@S, 3@S, or 4@S. But which one is the best—safest and most obstructive? Let us review what North knows in addition to what he has in his hand.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


AT| North/South are not vulnerable, have at least a 9-card fit in spades, and the opponents have more than twice the number of HCP—28.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2@S is a conservative bid and could not get the partnership in trouble. However, the opponents holding the majority of points and being short in spades would not allow North/South to play in 2@S contract. To follow the same line of reasoning the bid of 3@S is not really that much better.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT| The real aggressive bid is a jump to 4@S by North.|MB|4S|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the Opponents can either pass and let North/South play the 4@S—highly unlikely, double the 4@S or outbid North/South in minors.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


AT| For the sake of making the point let us consider that East doubles the 4@S followed by three passes.|MB|xPPP|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With only North/South hand open we can say that the contract easily is down two or three even if the hearts and spades are divided favorably. So, the best case scenario is that North/South might escape for a penalty of 300 points, since they are non vulnerable. And that could be a great sacrifice.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With 28 HCP and a few added distributional points East/West surely can make game or even slam contract—3NT, 5C, or 5D. Next, you will see East/West hands randomly produced. To try more random hands you can remove the North/South cards from the deck and randomly divide the remaining cards between East/West and play the hands with a partner.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


AT| Let us take a look at randomly produced East/West hands as shown above. You can play the hand double dummy if you wish.|pf|y|md|0,s32ht3dak976ck762,0,satha42dqjt8caqjt|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


pf||NT|^B@2
There are many parts to this bidding sequence. By jumping to 4S, North is risking a loss of 300 or 500 points hoping that East–West will misjudge the situation. East–West could double for penalty while they could get more for bidding a game, or settle for game when they can make a slam, or bid slam when they can make only game.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, East/West may not know whether North’s jump to 4S is based on values with the expectation of making the contract and let North/South escape undoubled in a 4@S contract. We should mention that Howard considers 4S by North an overbid and continues, "Maybe if EW vul, NS not, it is ok. 3S is fine."|

To find out which minor suit partner holds, North bids 4NT and hopes that his partner does not play the bid as Blackwood convention. It simply asks South to name his minor suit.|

Either 4C or 4NT is correct. Obviously, West’s 3S bid takes away North’s artificial 2NT bid. If North wants to compete at the four level in a minor suit, North should not bid 3NT.

The best bid is 3S. There is at least a nine-card fit in spades and also a nine-card fit in whichever minor suit East holds. 3S may not make, but if that’s the case, the opponents can probably make, at least a game in hearts. West should not leave room for them to find their best spot. An aggressive West may bid 4S.|

West should bid 2NT. West doesn’t like spades; 2NT asks which minor suit East holds. West intends to pass whether East bids 3C or 3D.|

The bidding starts as shown above.|

MB|P?|lb|*bWhat should West bid?^^3H|MB|3h|NT|^B@2
3@H is the correct bid. With an excellent fit in spades and a strong hand, West expects to make at least 4S. Slam is still a possibility, since West also has a useful king in whichever minor suit East holds. Cuebidding the opponent’s suit shows at least game-invitational values. If East makes a minimum bid, 3S for example, West bids game. By bidding game in this manner, West shows interest in slam. If East shows a good hand by jumping to 4S, West can investigate bidding slam.|

4S. The partnership has at least a ten-card fit in spades. If East’s other suit is diamonds, there is a good fit in two suits. If East’s other suit is clubs, there isn’t more than one loser in that suit, and East won’t have many hearts and diamonds. If 4S doesn’t make, the opponents will have at least a game — and maybe a slam — in hearts.|

4NT. Whichever minor suit East holds, there is a tremendous fit. West asks East to show the minor suit at the game level.|

The Michaels cuebid can be used in the balancing position. By cuebidding 2D, South shows both major suits.|

st||rh||ah|S8|MD|4S AJ234 HAKJ765 D9 C8,,,|SV|o|MB|2d|lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^3d|mb|3d|NT|^B@2
Many experts who use the Michaels cuebid play that a 3D-a direct cuebid-is showing both major suits. In this situation, South is promising a reasonably good hand with both major suits. When the opponents open with a pre-emptive bid, you should not also make a pre-emptive bid. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Please note, however, that there are experts who play a cue bid over a pre-empt only promises a good hand with two suits, other than the bid suit. For example  3D in this auction promises two suits other than diamonds and not necessarily both majors. Of course there are others who play the 3D differently.|

A cuebid of 3C will likely be interpreted by partner as the Michaels cuebid convention, showing both major suits. This bid is superior to 2H overcall.|

The correct answer is 4C. Many partnerships bid 4C Michaels cuebid-a direct cuebid-to show both major suits. Please see the note in example S8.|
