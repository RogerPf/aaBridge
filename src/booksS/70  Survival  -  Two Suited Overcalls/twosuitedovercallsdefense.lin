^B@2The defense against Two-Suited Overcalls outlined by Marty Bergen probably is the easiest to learn. Therefore, this section is based mainly on Marty Bergen's ^*IBetter Bidding With Bergen Volume II^*N : |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||AT|. However, in preparing this section we also have borrowed from Mr. Roth's teaching—they are very similar. This section has two parts:|

^-|FP||ht|d|cs||cp||AT|^B@2The defense against two-suited overcall bids is ingenious and based on the difference between constructive and competitive bidding principles. In competitive bidding, after an overcall, the Opener's partner loses a few of his original options—bids—but gains a few new ones—cuebid of the overcalled suit. For example when the bidding goes 1S-(a suit overcall)- now responder can cuebid the overcalled suit to show a limit raise or better.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

The same principle is used in defense against two-suited overcalls except in most instances, there are two suits known. For that reason defending against UNT overcalls is the easier of the two because a jump overcall in Notrump by the opponent ^*Balways^*N shows the two lower unbid suits. Because the two suits are known, therefore, there would be two new cuebids available for the Opener's partner. They are the cuebid of the ^*Blower unbid suit shown^*N (cheaper cuebid) and the cuebid of the next unbid suit, or ^*Bthe higher^*N of the two if you will (the ##2 cuebid).|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Each cuebid has a specific meaning and along with the other options available to the Opener's partner form a solid line of defense. Before we look at a few examples a schematic diagram of the defense lines is in order. It is from Mr. Roth's paper. In our diagram we will start with 1H-2N-? bidding. You may find it repetitious but trust me it would not hurt to have it pounded in our brains—at least mine :).|

Again the 2N shows the two minor suits—clubs and diamonds. Therefore, the 3C is the cheaper cuebid and 3D is ##2 cuebid. In this bidding cycle and the previous one Opener's partner loses the 1N, 2C, 2H and 2S bids because of the 2N overcall. However, all the other bids starting from 4D on are available and they maintain their original constructive meaning.|

AT|

Number of experts (Howard included) play the cheaper and ##2 cuebids the other way. That is the cheaper cue bid shows the cheaper suit (e.g. 1S-2N-3C shows hearts) and the higher cue bid shows the higher suit (e.g 1S-2N-3D shows spades).|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |

The rest of bids available to the Opener's Partner have the same meaning as in the competitive bidding. We will deal with those shortly.|

Double = Interest in doubling one, or both, minors. Opener is invited to double any bid by the partner of the UNT bidder or pass it back to partner.|

Utilizing these methods enable Opener's partner to locate four-four major suit fits, use transfers when responder has a long major, and penalize 3C or 3D when he has good defense against the minors. |

Mr. Roth continues, "These treatments and adjustments will help you to counter the Unusual Notrump, but you will not find in them a master key to unlock all doors, for there is none. In practice, we attempt to follow the sage advice of ^*IS. J. Simon^*N, the great British expert, whose philosophy in competitive auctions was '^*BGet the best result possible; not necessarily the best possible result.^*N' We have found that this is good advice in resolving just about all bridge problems."|

pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at| Clearly, now all the bids through 2NT which you had when the RHO passed disappear—Pass still is an option of course. On the other hand, two cuebids-based on the two suits implied by the overcaller-the two lower unbid suits-become available. In the case of 1S opening the two suits implied are clubs and diamonds. Thus, the responder (you sitting South) gains ^*Bthe 3C cuebid—the cheaper cuebid—and 3D cuebid or ##2 cuebid.^*N|

For defense against a UNT overcall when the two suits implied are known we can use the simple guideline just outlined. Case closed. On balance the responder loses a few of his bids but gains two cuebids-the cheaper = good raise of partner's suit; Cuebid ##2 = game force in fourth suit. Let us try it after 1C opening.|

Many experts are concerned about the "or better" portion as the partnership may be faced with 4-1 trump break.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT| After a one suited overcall Howard plays the limit raise or better to show 4-card support. But he adds, "Since the 2N takes up so much bidding room, the cuebid here only promises good 3-card support. This is in contrast to 1S-2D-?, where there is much more room to bid a new suit, and I prefer that 3D shows 4+ card support."|

This is a good example of the "or better" for 3C-the cheaper cuebid-showing a limit raise or better, Even if partner signs off in 3S, you would bid 4S. Of course you may consider the Law of Total Tricks and bid 4S right away. There is only a small probability that you may miss slam in spades.|

What is the double by Opener's partner (you) in this bidding sequence?|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


AT| It conveys the same message as a redouble after a takeout double. The doubler shows 10+ points. It also tends to deny support for opener's suit (because then responder would bid #1 cue bid) or length in the 4th suit (because then responder would bid #2 cue bid).|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, it sends a strong message that we cannot let them buy the contract undoubled. Quite often, one or the other will end up doubling the opponents. Let us look at a suitable hand for South in this bidding cycle.|

^-|FP||ht|d|cp||cs||AT|^B@2The defense against Michaels cuebids is very similar to defending against UNT particularly when both suits are known. However, there may be confusion when one of the two suits promised by the overcaller is unknown (1H-2H and 1S-2S). The good news, however, is that Opener's partner-in most instances-can bid at the 2 level-a lower level than when UNT is the overcall bid. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|

First, let us look at the defense guideline for when both implied suits by the overcaller are known such as in 1C-2C and 1D-2D—(hearts and spades in both cases). The defense is similar to when the overcall is an UNT. To illustrate, therefore, we will use the same pattern as we did for explaining the defense against the UNT. |
