^-|CP||fp||ht|d|AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis is my cheat sheet, so to speak. I used several sources which I have named them on the first page. However, I am indebted to Howard Schutzman for his generous help and editing this work. More importantly, I like to thank him for putting up with my many questions, some of which would drive any other teacher insane. In making this movie, I borrowed liberally from my sources which I am thankful to the authors.|

I do not have to introduce Howard Schutzman, "hondo717", Susan Doty, (sdoty), or Shelagh Paulsson, "shep" to anyone who plays on BBO. But "bridge 7" is a site from Turkey which I really like. On this site, you will find treasures in bridge. Alas, Susan's site no longer is working. No one knows of her whereabouts.  |

In this work, we have a short explanation of the standard response by the partner in a constructive bidding. Then, we try to deal with Inverted Minor Raises without and with interference by the Opponents.  |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

First and foremost, we should be familiar with basics on hand categories which many of us bridge-challenged forget during the course of our bidding. For that I will refer to Howard's web site at|CP|1|AT| ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/##constructive^*N|CP||AT|. This is a small part of a recent great 5 lesson series on the Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding by Howard in the Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL). Those lessons are a must read for every bridge-challenged.|

{  Playing Standard  }
^-|CP||fp||at|
^B@2You should pass with less than six points.
With stronger hands responder's first priority is to bid 1 of a major if he has one of them. 
With one four-card or longer major suit, bid that major. 
With 2 majors which are 4-4 bid hearts first
If majors are 5-4, bid the longest major first.
If majors are 5-5, bid spades first.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

With no 4-card or longer major, responder's second priority is to bid NT whenever possible--a balanced hand. Why?|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|
Because you need only nine tricks for a NT game contract while you need 11 tricks for a minor suit game contract--assuming the partnership had the required points.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

Bid 1NT with a minimum hand (6-9 HCP)
2NT with a medium (10-12 HCP), and 
3NT with a maximum hand (13+ HCP).
^B@2^*BOn occasions, following this guideline lands the partnership in a doomed NT contract though they have adequate HCP.^*N|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|

Further, after partner opens the bidding with 1@C or 1@D, sometimes, responder cannot bid either a major or NT and is forced to support opener's minor. Playing standard responses, responder can make:|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT| 

^*BI^*N. A single raise to 2 of the bid minor (showing 6-9 Starting Points) or
^*BII^*N. an invitational raise to 3 of the bid minor (showing 10-12 Starting Points). 
Unfortunately, responder, playing standard then does not have a way to make a forcing raise with a stronger hand.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

Inverted Minor Raises is a convention which can remedy both the above shortcomings. ^*BIt gives responder a forcing bid and also helps partnership avoid reaching a doomed NT contract.^*N Next we will learn how. I like how Susan Doty explained the basic. Next let me quote from Susan Doty's web site. Fortunately, I have a saved copy from the site before it went down.|

^-|CP||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSusan: |CP||AT|The basic structure of Inverted Minor Raises is as follows:|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


fp|2|AT|

^B@2I. Single Raise|FP||AT|:1@C/2@C - 1@D/2@D Invitational or better values (10+ HCP)  4+ card support. No 4+ card major. Not suited for a direct 2NT (10-12 balanced HCP) or 3NT (13-15 balanced HCP) responses. ^*BNote: this bid is forcing for one round.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


fp|2|AT|

^B@2^*BII. Jump Raise:|fp||at|1@C/3@C - 1@D/3@D Preemptive (no more than 7 HCP)--about 6 to 9 Dummy Points; No 4+ card major; 5+ card support. (With 8-9 HCP we have too many values to raise preemptively, so bid 1NT instead).^*N|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

As you note as a started the SINGLE RAISE and the JUMP RAISE are reversed. Both the single raise and jump raise must be alerted. The single raise is off after interference. However, the Jump raise is not affected. Most expert play Inverted Minor Raises after a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


CP||fp||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BSusan: |CP||AT|Points to consider: Just because we have a hand that *can* make a single raise does not mean that we necessarily *should*.  Before making a 2@C/2@D raise, double check to make sure that an initial NT response wouldn't be a better description.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

If you start by bidding 2@C/2@D when you have an accurate NT bid available you will usually end up in the same final contract... but you will have given the opponents a lot of information along the way. |

{ |CP|4|AT|Responding in NT does not deny 4+ card support for opener's Minor Suit|CP||AT| }
^-|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


CP||FP||at|
^B@2You will sometimes have hands that aren't strong enough for a single raise, but that you don't feel are preemptive in nature either.  In those instances, 1NT will often be a good choice even when you have four cards (sometimes even five!) in opener's minor. This is particularly the case when you are near the top of your strength in high card points (8-9) and/or have honor cards in your short suits.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|  

Don't worry:  partner will know that you might be somewhat off-shape for your 1NT bids. One of the side effects of using Inverted Minor Raises is that these in-between hands with support often get "stuck" with an initial 1NT response--and partner should be aware of this.|

HT|b|CS|1|CP|4|FP|2|at|^-{   How I play Inverted Minor Raises - by Howard     }
^-|CP||fp||at|
^B@21) If I make a minor raise (to either the 2 level or 3 level), I am guaranteed to have no 4-card major. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

2) I make a jump raise (to the 3 level) with 5 to a bad 9 points and a 5+ card suit. I might have the other minor, but feel that the jump raise is tactically the right thing to do to make it difficult for the opponents. I will tend to prefer the jump raise to a bid of 1N if I have 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT| 

3) I make a limit raise with 10+ points and usually 5-card support. (The only time I will have 4-card support is if I am 4-4 in the minors and partner opens 1@D.) If partner opens clubs, I will not have 4 diamonds. If partner opens diamonds, I will not have 5+ clubs (in SAYC; in 2 over 1,  1@D/2@C is slightly more complicated).|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT| 

4) Opener should now respond with his lowest stopper. If responder has less than a game-forcing hand, he should continue to bid stoppers below three of the agreed upon suit, or 2N if he has ^*Iall the other suits stopped^*N. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|

5) If responder has a game-forcing hand, he must make sure the partnership bids game by either bidding 3N, if all suits are stopped, or continue bidding new suits, if not. Again, new suits are forcing.|

ht|v|at|^B@2The above 4 auctions are the first step of Inverted Minor Raises. Again as you note the single raise and jump raise is the inversion of the standard bidding. The follow-up bids by the opener and responder are the critical part where partnership explores the proper auction. After the single raise both should continue biding stoppers, if any, below three of the agreed upon suit, until a partscore or game in the minor bid, or a safe NT has been reached. Therefore, a good understanding of stoppers is a must. In the next section we address the stoppers.|

^-|ht|c|FP||cs||cp||AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NAfter partner opens the bidding with 1@C or 1@D and you bid 3@C or 3@D respectively the rebid  by opener is simple. In most instances he bids pass and the partnership plays in a partscore. On occasions, opener has a huge hand and can bid 3N with other suits stopped or game in minor bid.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|

However, if the bidding goes 1@C-P-2@C-P or 1@D-P-2@D-P the partnership starts bidding the cheapest full-stoppers in the other three suits up the line. The first partner who is assured that the three suits are stopped bids either 2NT or 3NT based on his hand's strength. This can happen with opener's first rebid assuming he has all the requirements to do so. On the other hand, the partnership stops at partscore in the bid minor if they are lacking full stopper in one of the suits.|

Some expert may not like to make the 3N bid because it takes up too much room and precludes looking for slam. On the other hand they agree, you need sophisticated methods for finding out if you have a minor suit slam or not. Therefore, for most of us 3N is probably best.

nt||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^2S|NT|^B@2
Again two suits are stopped. The partner who is in line has the third suit stopped and bids NT at the appropriate level. Lacking any stopper North should bid the bid minor. However, with half-stopper in the third suit (spades here) bids that suit.|mb|2S|AN|ASKING|

PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is simple to recognize whether a bid is ^*BT^*Nelling or ^*BAsking because the Inverted Minor Raises structure is very logical. As you may recall after a single raise the partners must bid the cheapest stopper up the line. Therefore, there will be a conclusion not later than the third bid after the single raise. The partnership either ends up in 3N, game in the minor bid, or partscore in in the minor bid. |
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, when one of the partners bids a suit which he has already denied having a stopper in, it is an ^*BAsking bid. An ^*BAsking bid in a suit, therefore, shows half-stopper and asks partner to bid NT with a half-stopper in that suit. |
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThat is the simple part. The trouble begins to successfully determine which is a half-stopper in the dummy or in hand. As we already know Kx for example, is a stopper if it is in declarer's hand. If it is in Dummy it is an iffy stopper. If that suit is led, then the K is only a stopper if the A is in the leader's hand. That skill along with a little luck will go a long way to avoid bad NT contracts.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NFurther, I have a simple rule in my memory bank which says:
If one of us after two suits are establish with stoppers and bid something other than the bid minor or NT, it must be an asking bid. It is on the same line as, "The dog did not bark." 

And I crown any 3-card combination containing one top honor below King a half-stopper. Please do not call me if you end up in bad NT contract based on my rule -:).|

Playing Inverted Minor Raises, after partner opens the bidding with 1@C or 1@D, and responder does not have a 4+ card major suit to show, or a ^*Ibalanced^*N hand suitable for a NT response. He does one of the following:|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|

^*BI^*N. A jump raise shows a hand with no more than 9 Dummy Points, no 4-card major, and a 5-card fit for opener's suit--1@C-P-3@C/1@D-P-3@D. 
Opener should have an exceptional hand to bid again.
Requirements for the jump raise are:
1. No 4-card major suit.
2. Any 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


AT|

^*BII^*N. A single raise shows a good hand with 10 or more HCP; no 4-card major; and a 5-card fit for partner's suit--1@C-P-2@C/1@D-P-2@D. 
The single raise is forcing for one round.
Requirements for the single raise are:
1. No 4-card major suit.
2. 5-card support for a single raise but do with 4-card support if no better bid is available.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT|

The search for a safe NT contract begins after a single raise by responder. Opener should bid his lowest stopper up the line. Responder keeps the bidding open by bidding the next stopper. Either, opener or responder can bid NT in the appropriate level when all suits are stopped. If not either can retreat to the bid minor. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

Once 3 suits have been bid (the original suit and 2 stopper suits), if someone bids the fourth suit, that is ^*BA^*Nsking about a stopper rather than telling, because if the bidder has the remaining suit stopped, he can bid NT himself. |FP||
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

Inverted minors are off in competition (including over takeout doubles), in the sense that a raise to 2 is less than a limit raise. A raise to 3 is still preemptive.|

CP||fp||AT|^B@2^y@3This section deals with opener's rebid and responder's second response bid. In most part the focus is on when responder bids a single raise which as you know promises an invitational or stronger hand with 5-card support which is not suitable for NT. In most instances the opponents do not interfere. In all instances, you will see the auction followed by an explanation of the last bid. We only addressed the more common auctions.|

^-|cs|4|fp||cp||at|^B@2
Over a takeout double--Howard's style:
I play that if you don't redouble or bid Jordan 2N over a takeout double you can't have 10 points.
After a double, new suits by responder are not forcing, whether or not they are at the 1-level. The more standard style is to play 1-level bids are forcing, but Howard does not like that style.

(this may not be standard). 
Redouble is the only way to show 10 points. 
You bid 1N with 8-11 points
Bid 2N with five card support and 10+ points. 
Weak jump shifts and weak raises are highly recommended. 
For more information see |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/lsx6cx^*N|CP||
pg| ***** 196 ***** |


AT|

Over an overcall--Howard's style:
1. Inverted Raises are off.
2. The game chances are not as likely when your partner opens a minor suit. And it is more likely the opponents can outbid you at the same level in the majors. So your objective is to get in their way promptly.
3. When opening one of a minor, 85% or more of the time partner will have 4+ cards although it is possible that partner only has a 3-card suit. So bid as if he/she does have four.
4. A cue bid is available to show a limit raise. Therefore, there is no reason to play a raise to 2 is strong.
5. Your first priority still is to show a major. Absent a major your hand either is worth 6-9 or 10+ points.
^cWith less than six points you pass.
^cBid 1NT with a stopper in the overcaller's suit and 8-11 points.
^cRaise to 2 with 4 card support and 6-9 pointsno 4+ card majors.
^cJump raise to 3 with 5 card support, 6-9 points, and no 4+ card majorsnote additional trump card needed.
^cWith 10+ points and at least 4 cards in opener's suit (assuming you have no major suits) cue bid.
