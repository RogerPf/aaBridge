^-|HT|c|cp||FP||at|^b@2^z@3In general, it is usually easier to play in a suit than NT. This is particularly true when responder has a weak hand. Garbage Stayman was invented to allow the contract to be played in a suit at the 2 level when responder has a very weak hand (usually 4 or fewer points).|

HT|f|AT|

There are 2 variations:
* Classic Garbage Stayman
* Major Suit Garbage Stayman or Crawling Stayman

Classic Garbage Stayman works as follows. Responder has a weak hand with at least 4 diamonds and at least 3 cards in each major. Over 1N, responder bids 2@C. No matter what opener bids, responder passes. Therefore, the final contract will be either 2@D, 2@H, or 2@S.|

Classic Garbage Stayman works as follows. Responder has a weak hand with at least 4 diamonds and at least 3 cards in each major. Over 1N, responder bids 2@C. No matter what opener bids, responder passes. Therefore, the final contract will be either 2@D, 2@H, or 2@S.

Major Suit Garbage Stayman works as follows. Responder has a weak hand with at least 4-4 in the majors. Over 1N, responder bids 2@C. If opener bids 2@H or 2@S, responder has an easy pass, and is playing in a 4-4 fit. If opener bids 2@D, then responder bids 2@H. This tells opener that responder wants to play in either 2@H or 2@S. Opener passes with better hearts, and corrects to 2@S with better spades. The final contract is often a 7-card major suit fit (since the NT opener cannot have a doubleton in both hearts and spades), but this is usually better than playing 1N with a weak dummy.|

You can play both Classic and Major Suit Garbage Stayman simultaneously.|

Many people do not play Major Suit Garbage Stayman so it is recommended you discuss this with your partner before deciding to play it. If you don't discuss it, then if the auction goes 1N-2@C-2@D-2@H, your partner might incorrectly assume you have an invitational hand with 5 hearts and 4 spades when, in fact, you want partner to pass or correct to 2@S.|
