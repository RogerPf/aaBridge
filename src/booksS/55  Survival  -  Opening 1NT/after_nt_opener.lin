{        Constructive Auctions after a 1NT Opening Bid       }
^-|FP||cp||at|^b@2^Y@3Constructive auctions after a 1NT opener are very straightforward. These auctions very much illustrate the "responder is Captain" principle. As opener, you should open 1NT if at all possible. This includes opening 1NT without stoppers in some suits and with a 5-card major. 1NT is a very descriptive bid--it shows 15-17 HCPs and only 3 possible hand shapes (4-4-3-2, 5-3-3-2, and 4-3-3-3). |

^-{  Responder Hand Categories  }
^-|cp||AT|^b@2^Y@3
In the rest of this tutorial, I will assume the reader uses basic hand evaluation techniques. That is, he or she uses the standard 4-3-2-1 method for counting HCP and makes small adjustments for either shortness or length. I now teach, and prefer, the more accurate Bergen methodology, but because it is not familiar to everyone, I will not use it in these lessons.

AT|As responder, hands fall into one of 3 categories--|CP|8|FP|2|AT|MINIMUM, MEDIUM, or MAXIMUM. |FP||CP||AT|The point ranges are slightly different than the ranges we discussed earlier.  The  point ranges are:|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

  ^cMinimum |FP||CP||AT|^f- no more than 7 points; game is not possible;|CP|8|FP|2|AT|
  ^CMedium |FP||CP||AT|^f- 8-9 points; game is possible if opener has a maximum NT (defined below);|CP|8|FP|2|AT|
  ^CMaximum |FP||CP||AT|^f- 10 or more points; you must bid game.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|
    
When responder has a medium hand, opener is invited to bid game with maximum NT hand. A hand is considered maximum NT if it meets any of the following criteria:
^C* Any hand with 17 HCPs
^C* Any hand with 16 HCPs and a fit with responder's major suit
^C* Any hand with 16 HCPs and a 5-card suit
^C* Any hand with 16 HCPs, not 4-3-3-3 distribution, and at least two 10s or 9s.|

Now that you understand how to determine whether or not to bid game, the rest of the lesson will focus on how to determine whether the best contract is NT, hearts, or spades.|

As responder, it is easy to determine if you should explore for a major suit contract.|

If you do not hold at least ^*Ufour cards in either major^*N, you should not bother to look for a
major suit fit. (On the few occasions when opener has a five-card major, you may miss a 5-3
fit, but most of the time NT will play just as well anyway.)|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions  and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
