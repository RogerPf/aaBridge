{ How do you get the correct Bergen or Declarer Points? }|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


cp||AT|

Declarer points according to Bergen's method has two parts, 
^c(a). Starting Points and  
^c(b). Additional Points after the fit. 

Therefore, first count the Starting Points then add additional points, according to schedule below-because there is a fit.|

Let us repeat the schedule as it is outlined in Marty Bergen's book. Declarer Points = a + b
^B-- a. Starting points plus,
^B-- b. Declarer Short Suit After a Raise calculated according to the following guideline.
^C-- A Singleton is a two points assets.
^C-- A Doubleton = 0 point
^C-- 2-3 Doubleton = 1 point only
^C-- A Void = 4 points and not 3 as is traditional
^C-- Add 1 point for each trump over 5
^C-- A 4-card side suit (even a weak one) = 1 point|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

Please note that a "^*B5-card quality suit ^*N" is particularly valuable in declarer's hand after a fit. Such holding, originally contributes 1 point for length and 1 point for quality to the Starting Points calculation. Then, after the fit declarer adds another point for a 4+ card side suit. Therefore, a 5-card side suit of good quality add 3 points to the value of declarer's hand in addition to its Raw HCP.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


HT|q|cs|4|at|^b  {|ih|pCAKJ87|at|}|ht|q|at|^i@2^Z@3 The suit on left is worth 11 points in declarer's hand. 8 HCP + 1 point for quality suit + 1 point for a 5-card side suit + 1 point for a 4+card side suit in declarer's hand which is only added after a fit.|

The hand is worth 24 Bergen points. Starting points = 20, 16 Raw HCP, 2 length points,1 quality suit point and plus one point because Aces/Tens exceed the quacks. Once partner makes a limit raise, you can add  4 Additional Points, 1 point for your sixth heart + 1 point for your 4 card club side suit + 2 points for your singleton.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^6h|mb|6h|NT|^B@2
The partnership has 34-36 points, they should be in 6@H. You could either cue bid controls, or just bid 6@H. There is no reason to bid Blackwood since you have controls in all suits. Bergen recommends you just bid 6@H, as 7 would take a very specific hand from partner, and would be difficult to figure out.|

18 Starting Points = 19 Raw HCP + 1 length point + 1 quality suit - 2 dubious Doubletons - 1 adjust3. There are 2 Additional points after the raise, 1 for 2 Doubletons and 1 for 4+ diamond side suit. That is 20 Bergen Points.|

NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^4h|mb|4h|NT|^B@2
The partnership has 20 + max of 12 which is only 32, so you should just bid 4@H. Please note that when counting Dummy Points you add 1 for each doubleton. However, for calculating Declarer Points, 2 Doubletons are worth 1 point, 1 doubleton is not worth anything extra.|

Starting Points is 10 HCP + 2 for six spades = 12. Because of the fit you add one (double dip) for sixth spade and 2 for singleton, so you have 15 Declarer Points.|

So you know you have enough in terms of points to bid six. The question is do you have enough Aces? To find out you bid 4NT, and  bid six if you are only missing one Ace at most. Don't worry about 2 diamond losers, since partner opened 1@D.|

NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^4n|NT|^B@2
Since opener showed 17, there are enough points for slam, assuming you are not missing 2 Aces. So 4N is the bid.  As a reminder, as declarer, you only add a point for 2 Doubletons, not one doubleton.|MB|4N|

SK||nt||AT|^B@2
Responder bids 4N, and opener bids 5@H (2 Aces, no Q of spades), and responder bids 6@s.  And if you look at the two hands, 6@S is a great contract, with only 26 Raw HCP.  BTW, if you are off a point or so, it really doesn't much matter. The idea is for you to figure out how to upgrade your hands appropriately. The point is that you can bid slams with good fits, even with not that many high card point.|

^-|Cp||cs||fp||at|
^b@2In the following examples please count the Declarer Points of the hand based on the auction presented. The auction will set whether the hand is Declarer or Dummy. 

Each quiz has four panels. In first you count the Declarer Points. Second panel has the correct answer and how it is calculated with a summary of Bergen's guideline in the left lower corner.

In the third panel you are asked to make a bid based on the information you have collected. Finally, in fourth panel you have the correct bidding and additional comments which generally is by Howard Schutzman, BBO nickname "hondo717" or from Bergen's book ^*Islam Bidding Made Easier^*N. Thus, it is a double delight-learning to evaluate your hand using Bergen's method and learning the proper bidding.

Please try again if you have not answered the quiz correctly on the first try. You always can bypass the quiz by clicking the "Tell Me" box. 

WARNING @D@D This is a long session. do it in couple sessions.|
