But even if that happens, most often the contract ends up in opener's suit anyway so no real harm is done if responder is forced to either underbid 3@c, bid 2N, or raise with 2-card support.|

cp||at|We used the examples in Quiz 2 from The Bridge World as the template with Howard making the necessary corrections. You may find out that in some instances Howard does not agree with the information offered by The Bridge World. Please note responding to 2@c with a good hand is not being discussed here. However. not all the responders's hand are as bad as we have here. Those are what we will be focusing on next.|

cp||at|In the past and even now, some people liked the idea of responder being able to still show a really bad hand, and played 2@h as the "negative" or "bust" bid. I played that for many years, and it is still played by many.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bThe main problem with playing 2H shows a bust hand is when the 2C bidder's suit is hearts. The contract is wrong sided (e.g. the weak hand ends up as declarer because of the artificial 2H bid). And the auction gets too high too fast. The auction starts 2C-2H-3H, where 3H is the first natural bid and the 2H bid has preempted the partnership. On that auction you are pretty much committed to playing 4H and have little chance of getting to 3N when that is the best contract. It is because of this problem that I strongly prefer not to play 2H as showing a bust hand.|

cp||at|Bid two diamonds. You do not have a suit to show. The only bid you have to show points is two notrump. In this regard, I recommend you NEVER bid two notrump in response to an opening two club bid. It takes away bidding room, plus it can make the wrong hand declarer. Respond two diamonds and leave opener room to show his hand.|
