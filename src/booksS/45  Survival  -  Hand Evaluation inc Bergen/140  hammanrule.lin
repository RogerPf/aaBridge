^-|at|^B@2Robert David (Bob) Hamman (born August 6, 1938 in Pasadena, California)-|CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hamman^*N|CP||AT| is an American professional bridge player, among the greatest players of all time. Hamman and Bobby Wolff played as partners for nearly three decades on teams that challenged for major trophies in North America and often for world championships. Representing the United States (from about 1980, previously North America) they won eight world championships for national teams, the 1988 World Team Olympiad and seven Bermuda Bowls spanning 1970 to 1995. Probably his most popular and emotional win, other than the 1970 Bermuda Bowl, was the 2000 Vanderbilt Trophy, the oldest open teams event in North America.|

And below we will bring you a summary of it:

Ever since the world team championship for the Bermuda Bowl was inaugurated in 1950, North American teams have been in contention. On every occasion but one they have finished first or second. The lone exception was in Rio de Janeiro in 1969 when Italy and Taiwan contested the final. The unsuccessful American team on that occasion included two brilliant young experts: Bob Hamman and Eddie Kantar. Discouraged by the result, they promptly dissolved their partnership. |

In the next 11 years, Hamman won three Bermuda Bowl titles and Kantar two. The wounds of Rio seemed to have healed; so, in a moment of mutual weakness they decided to venture forth again. Before beginning play in a regional tournament in Reno, NV., Kantar found, as he explained in an entertaining article in the American Contract Bridge League Bulletin, that he had to review "ROBERT'S RULES." These are not rules of order, but rather rules to order the conduct of Robert Hamman's partners. |

Rule 1: If a number of bids are available and one of them is three no-trump, that's the bid. 
Rule 2: Never play Robert for the perfect hand. He never has it. 
Rule 3: If everyone at the table seems to be bidding his head off, trust them, not Robert. 
Rule 4: When contemplating a slam, always subtract a king from what it sounds like Robert has before bidding the slam. 
Rule 5: Be practical. 
Rule 6: Do the right thing. ^*N|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|^B@2

Unfortunately, the rules gave no guidance about situations in which the rules were in conflict. Poor Kantar kept wanting to make aggressive three no-trump bids in accordance with rule 1, but had to worry about rules 2 and 3, not to mention 6. When he moved toward a slam and went down only one in five spades, he was charged, of course, with having broken rules 2 and 4. Let us look at one of the boards they played.|

The coup de grace - or perhaps disgrace - came on the above diagramed deal, with Kantar sitting East and Robert West.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


MB|PP1SP3SP4NP5DP5NP6CP6SPPXPPP|nt|^B@2
The opponents' bidding followed a rather erratic course, starting with an invitational jump raise in which the distribution did not sufficiently compensate for the lack of trumps and lack of high-card points.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Whether a void should be shown in responding to Blackwood is a point that is often argued. Some experts with the North hand would bid six diamonds directly, promising one ace and a void in diamonds. This would have prevented South from inquiring about kings and might have prevented a debacle for the defenders.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^B@2
As it was, Kantar missed an opportunity to double six clubs to direct a lead in that suit. His postmortem excuses - the hope that they would bid seven spades, and the fear that they would redouble six clubs and play that contract - did not hold water. He tried to rectify the situation by doubling six spades and left Robert with a considerable problem. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Such doubles are normally the Lightner variety, asking for a specific abnormal lead. But Hamman knew that his partner would have doubled five diamonds if he had wanted a diamond lead and six clubs if he had wanted a club lead. And he would have passed if he wanted a heart lead.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^B@2
So, Robert considered three possibilities: 1) This is one of the rare slam doubles that call for a trump lead. 2) This is a take-out double. 3) My partner is an idiot.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Eventually, he shrugged his shoulders and led a diamond;|PC|qd3|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^B@2
So, South scored an overtrick. Whether the club lead Kantar wanted would have beaten the contract is doubtful. South could have made the slam by playing low on the first trick, but he might have feared a singleton lead and played the ace, going down.|
