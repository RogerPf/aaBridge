HT|k|AT|^B@2Fourth hand should open if your HCP plus number of spades totals 15 or more. Remember, this applies only to borderline hands; you know what to do with good ones.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

Why are spades crucial here?  You have limited strength and no one opened in front of you. You will therefore be waging a part-score battle in which you will want to outbid the opponents without getting too high. If you own spades, the opponents cannot buy the hand at the two-level.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Without spades, you might need to compete to the three level. The same is true for the opponents. If they want to compete over your 2@S bid, their two passed hands do not rate to make a nine-trick contract. The more spades you have, the safer it is to open.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

What suit should you choose for your opening bid?  No problem! Open the bidding in the same suit you would have with a good hand. Try the following examples to see how easy this is. Remember, add your HCP to the number of spades in your hand.|

Open 1@S. Use the Rule of 15. You have 10 HCP and five spades — a total of 15. You hope to make a low-level part score.|mb|1s|

Pass. With 11 HCP and two spades you should not open, even though this hand contains more HCP than the one before. You are concerned that the opponents hold spades, the dominant suit. Being able to make 2@H is worthless if they can bid and make 2@S.|mb|p|

Pass. Your 11 HCP plus one spade total 12. You probably can open using the Standard Rule of 20. But Marty Bergen would not open this hand. Try your luck with some new cards.|mb|p|

NT|^B@2
Whether you are playing for masterpoints or simply for the satisfaction of beating your friends, you prefer plus scores to minus scores. The Rule of 15 is a simple yet reliable tool to decide whether or not to open up what might prove to be a can of worms. You need not feel squeamish when armed with spades.|

^B@2Marty Bergen My former bridge partner, Marty Bergen, has 11 conventions named after him. I would like just one "Cohen" convention and I will get to it at the end of this article. Meanwhile, let's talk about 4th seat.|

{    FOURTH-SEAT WEAK 2-BIDS    }
^-|fp||at|

After Pass-Pass-Pass, there are some items to consider such as FOURTH-SEAT WEAK 2-BIDS. The normal range for a weak 2-bid is 6-10. But, after three passes, surely you wouldn't open the bidding with 6 points (nor 7, 8, or 9). Really, the range for a 4th-seat weak two should be about 10-14. |

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|After three passes, I'd be happy to open 2@S with the hand as is shown above. This combines preemption with description. Of course, you can't open this hand 2@S in any other seat, because it is too strong. Three-level preempts in fourth seat also show close to opening-bid values.|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|The "book" rule on whether or not to open in 4th seat says to add your HCP to your number of spades. If the total is 15, open the bidding. If less than 15, pass it out. The theory is that it will be a partscore battle, and if your side doesn't have enough of the high-ranking suit, you could easily lose the battle. |

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|When you open in 4th seat, you are often on the light side. If you open 1@S with this hand|

ht|m|at|^B, you don't want partner to get too excited. Say that he has a good hand with game interest as is shown below.|
ht|o|at|^b  {|ih|psSAJ5 H76 DJ42 CAJ872|at|}.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ht|u|at|^BYou wouldn't want to get too high opposite that hand (8 tricks are the limit). The responder is too strong for 2@S, but rather than bid 3@S, he can bid an artificial 2@C to say he has a limit raise (it is just a coincidence that this example contains a club suit--the Drury 2@C bid says nothing about clubs). Playing modern Drury, the opener would then rebid 2S to say he is not interested in game and the partnership stops safely on the two level. (Technically, this is called "Reverse_Drury," but it is the way "everyone" plays it.)|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Now, forget the Rule of 15 for deciding whether to open or pass out the deal in fourth seat. I prefer "Cohen's Rule In Fourth Seat (CRIFS). Any time it is borderline (like 10, 11, 12 HCP), evaluate your opponents! Yes, I am serious. If you are playing against Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell (or the best pair at your local duplicate game), then pass it out. You will likely get a middlish score/result. Who needs to open and have to do battle with an expert pair who will fight hard for the partscore and play or defend well? |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

Conversely, if you look up at your opponents and see Schlemiel and Schlimazel (the worst pair), then open the bidding. You can push them around in the auction and will get an extra trick or two in the play/defense. You rate to go plus--so don't pass the board out.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|

I ask just two small favors:

1) Please publicize this treatment with the "CRIFS" acronym.

2) Please don't tell your opponents why you opened that 10-count in fourth seat (I don't want them to know what we think of their game).|
