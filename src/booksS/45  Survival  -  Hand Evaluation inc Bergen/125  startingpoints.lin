^-|CP||FP||CS||AT|
A singleton honor, other than the ace, is not worth as much, because it may not take a trick. And a doubleton Q or doubleton J is also not worth as much. Dubious Singleton honors are easy to spot. However, Dubious Doubletons are a bit harder to spot. Bergen lists all of the Dubious Doubletons. Howard, however, thinks it is easier to define a Dubious Doubleton as |

PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cs||FP||CP||AT|
For example, Qx and Jx are clearly Dubious Doubletons.  Kx is not a Dubious Doubleton, because the K is not forced to be played under the ace. Other examples of Dubious Doubletons are KQ,  QJ, and KJ.  Basically, Dubious Doubletons are defined as any doubleton with a Q or J and not the ace. According to Bergen's method you deduct one point for each Dubious Doubleton or Singleton. Let us count Starting Points of the next examples with added parameter of Dubious Doubletons/Singletons.|

A quality suit is defined as a 4-card or longer suit which contains three of the top five honors. Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten are the honors. You add one point for each quality suit in the hand-Quality Suite Point. For example KQ10x is considered a "quality suit" and equals one point. However, there would be no points for KQ10-only three cards. Following are several hands holding quality suits. The total number of Quality Suits Points is printed under each hand.|

{    Adjust-3    }
^-|CP||FP||CS||AT|
Adjust-3, the last part, is the most complicated but does not apply to most hands. The old method of assigning values of 4, 3, 2, 1 to Ace, King, Queen, and Jack respectively is not completely accurate. Based on recent mathematical analysis, using a 10 point system, the more accurate values are:^*B
^-
A = 4.5,  K = 3,  Q = 1.5,  J = .75,  10 = .25
^-|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|
^*NBut the beauty of 4-3-2-1 is, it is relatively easy and most have trouble remembering the more accurate new set of points count. Marty Bergen came up with a way of approximating these points count, which he calls "Adjust-3" and is much easier to use. The standard points count under values Aces and 10s and over values Queens and Jacks (Quacks). Therefore, if the hand contains lots more Aces and 10s, add something and if it contains lots more Queens and Jacks, subtract something. Therefore, for each hand, count up the number of Aces and 10s and count up the number of Queens and Jacks (Quacks).|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


FP|2|AT|
^-
If the number of Aces and 10s is greater by 3 but less than 6 (for example you have 4 Aces 
and 10s and only 1 queen), add (adjust) 1 point to the hand's value.
|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|
Similarly, if the number of Queens and Jacks exceed the number of Aces and 10s by 3
but less than 6 (say you have 5 Queens and Jacks, and 2 Aces), you subtract (adjust) 1 point.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |

If the difference is 6+ in either situations add/subtract (adjust) 2.
And finally, Do nothing if the difference is 2 or less.

%%%%%% Adjust 3
AT|
Doing Adjust-3 is rather most difficult part of Bergen's method. If you don't want to bother, most of the time it won't make a difference. What you can do instead is look at your hand. If there are lots of Queens and Jacks, or lots of Aces and 10s, then you can try to apply Adjust-3, otherwise don't need to bother. However, it is good to remember if Aces+Tens outnumber Quacks by 3 or more (but less than 6) add one point. If Quacks outnumber Aces+tens by 3 or more (but less than 6), subtract one point. Adjust 2 points if one group or the other outnumbers by 6+. Let us practice a few examples and figure out the Starting Points for each hand using the complete Bergen's method.|

^b@2Based on standard Rule 20 (combined length of two longest suits plus HCP) this hand is an opener. However, based on the implications of Bergen's method on Rule 20 this hand is not an opener. In Bergen's method Rule 20 is the combined length of two longest suits plus ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP. The ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP is the sum of regular HCP, quality suits, Adjust-3, and Dubious Singleton/Doubletons. In another word it is Starting Points without length points.|

The last hand has 8 ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP (11 HCP less 2 points for Dubious Singleton/Doubletons, and less one point for Adjust-3).
