qx|A7,Dummy Points|
HT|b|cs|1|Cp|4|FP|2|AT|^-{    Dummy Points    }
^-|HT|c|CP||FP||at|As the first step, as soon as you pick up your hand, is counting your Starting Points. Then you should re-evaluate your hand's value after each bid. At the end of the auction, you are either a Dummy, or a Declarer, or defending. 

If partner opens a suit, you have a raise, there is a fit and that suit becomes trump, you will be dummy. You should upgrade the value of the hand (based to Bergen's guideline). The result is the ^*BDummy Points^*N.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


ht|h|fp|2|cs|1|cp|4|AT|^-{The sum of "Starting Points" and "Short-Suit Points" is the Dummy Points.}
^-|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


fp||CP||AT|
You already know how to count the Starting Points. The Short-Suit Points are the values assigned to Voids, Doubletons and Singletons in Dummy's hand according to schedule recommended by Marty Bergen.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Please note that in Bergen's method the dummy hand is the hand with ^*Bshorter trump suit^*N. Therefore, when the auction is completed after transfers, Michaels cuebids, or unusual NTs the dummy or the hand which goes on the table should upgrade the hand as a declarer and declarer upgrades the hand using the dummy points guideline.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

^d{1. Add one point (1) for each doubleton;}|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

^d{2. Add two points (2) for each Singleton with 3-card trump and
^d   add three points (3) with 4+ card trump;}|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

^d{3. For void add 1 point for each trump card. You add 5 if you have 5 trumps.}|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


fp||cp||AT|

So it is very simple. You plan to raise partner's suit and that suit most likely becomes trump. You already have counted your Starting Points. Now, your hand as a probable dummy needs to be upgraded. Then, count the Short-Suit points if any and add them to the Starting Points. Now you have an accurate value of your hand and can go further if your Dummy Points warrants.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |

%%% A short note
at|

^b@2Next are several practice hands.  Focus only on counting Short Suit Points and not the total Dummy Points. In all hands assume your partner opened 1 heart (1@H). Look at the hand first and count the Short Suit Points before clicking the forward arrow for the correct answer with the explanation if any.|

^K@2^Y@34 Short Suit Points. You count 1 point for the doubleton, and 3 points for the singleton, since you have a 4-card trump (if 3 card raise, only 2 points for the singleton.)|

HT|c|AT|^B
Because Marty Bergen adds lots of extra points for length, shortness, and high card quality, the ranges of hands are upgraded when you are deciding how good your hand is. So, using Marty Bergen's methods:|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

^cOpener
^D@2- a 13-16 Declarer Points hand is a minimum;
- a 17-19 Declarer Points hand is an intermediate
- a 20+ Declarer Points is a maximum.

^cResponder
^D@2- a 6-9 Dummy Points hand is a weak raise;
- a 10-12 Dummy Points hand is considered a limit raise;
- 13+ is a maximum.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, to bid game (in majors), you need at least 26 Total Points, not 25. To bid small slam, you need at least 33 Total Points between the two hands. Again, remember, because Marty Bergen adds many upgrades, you have to upgrade the number of points you need to bid game or slam. For more detailed information on his topic please review Howard's ^*IIntroduction to Constructive Bidding^*N tutorial--|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/baknrw^*N|CP||AT| which you can get either from BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or from Howard's web site.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|^b

For the next few hands, you open 1@C and partner bids 1@H. Decide how many Dummy Points you have for each hand (Starting Points + Short Points) and decide what your bid is.|

Since partner has at least six, you have at least 27 between the 2 hands, so you should bid game. We have not yet talked about splinters, but the correct bid on this hand is 4@D, which says "I have heart support, 20+ points, and shortness in diamonds."|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you don't play splinters, then you would bid 4@H. The 4@D or 4@H bid is not a shut out. It says, "partner I have a great hand -- 20 or more points." If responder has 13 or more, they should definitely be interested in slam.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand  1@C-P-1@H-P-3@H is not forcing. It is just invitational. The hand evaluation can be used both in SAYC and 2/1. |

2@H tends to show 4, but can be done with 3 card support on appropriate hands. Typically, you do that when you have 3 to an honor, and shortness somewhere, including a weak doubleton. With @HKQJ, virtually every expert would have no problem raising 1@H to 2@H.|

^-
^b@2In the following examples please count the Dummy Points of the hand based on the auction presented. The auction will set whether the hand is Declarer or Dummy. 

Each quiz has four panels. In first you count the Dummy Points. Second panel has the correct answer and how it is calculated with a summary of Bergen's guideline in the left lower corner.

In the third panel you are asked to make a bid based on the information you have collected. Finally, in fourth panel you have the correct bidding and additional comments which generally is by Howard Schutzman, BBO nickname "hondo717" or from Bergen's book ^*Islam Bidding Made Easier^*N. Thus, it is a double delight-learning to evaluate your hand using Bergen's method and learning the proper bidding.

Please try again if you have not answered the quiz correctly on the first try. You always can bypass the quiz by clicking the "Tell Me" box. |

|hf|p|cq|2|lb|*BNow, What bid would you make?^^2h|HT|r|FP|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3The correct call is 2@H. Typically the auction 1@C-1@H-2@H (or 1@D-1@H-2@H) promises 4 hearts by opener. However, it does not have to. Sometimes you can do it with good 3 card heart support (at least one high honor -- A, K, or Q -- or 2 honors), if your hand is likely to be better in a suit contract. Often this means you have shortness somewhere, particularly in spades. This hand is a perfect 2@H raise, and will be more encouraging to partner than rebidding your suit or bidding NT.
