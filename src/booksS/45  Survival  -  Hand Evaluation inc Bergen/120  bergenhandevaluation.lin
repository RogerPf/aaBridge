Marty Bergen BBO nickname "mbsez";|CP|1|AT| ^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N ^*Bmbergen@@mindspring.com ^*N|CP||AT|.

The first two sessions were primarily on Bergen's hand evaluation (First lesson, |CP|1|at|^*Htinyurl.com/apbkxoh^*N|CP||at| and the second lesson,|CP|1|at|^*Htinyurl.com/ahmvbsk^*N|CP||at|). For an in depth study of the topic please refer to the book and the BBO movies based on the Slam Bidding series. 

This is, however, a stand alone synopsis based on the above sources for those who wish to have a rather comprehensive but short preview.

A singleton honor, other than the ace, is not worth as much, because it may not take a trick. And a doubleton Q or doubleton J is also not worth as much. Dubious Singleton honors are easy to spot. However, Dubious Doubletons are a bit harder to spot. Bergen lists all of the Dubious Doubletons. Howard, however, thinks it is easier to define a Dubious Doubleton as |

For example, Qx and Jx are clearly Dubious Doubletons. Kx is not a Dubious Doubleton, because the K is not forced to be played under the ace. Other examples of Dubious Doubletons are KQ, QJ, and KJ. Basically, Dubious Doubletons are defined as any doubleton with a Q or J and not the ace. According to Bergen's method you deduct one point for each Dubious Doubleton or Singleton. Let us count Starting Points of the next examples with added parameter of Dubious Doubletons/Singletons.|

A quality suit is defined as a 4-card or longer suit which contains three of the top five honors. Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten are the honors. You add one point for each quality suit in the hand-Quality Suite Point. For example KQ10x is considered a "quality suit" and equals one point. However, there would be no points for KQ10-only three cards. Following are several hands holding quality suits. The total number of Quality Suits Points is printed under each hand.|

Adjust-3, the last part, is the most complicated but does not apply to most hands. The old method of assigning values of 4, 3, 2, 1 to Ace, King, Queen, and Jack respectively is not completely accurate. Based on recent mathematical analysis, using a 10 point system, the more accurate values are:^*B
^-
A = 4.5,  K = 3,  Q = 1.5,  J = .75,  10 = .25
^-|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|
^*NBut the beauty of 4-3-2-1 is, it is relatively easy and most have trouble remembering the more accurate new set of points count. Marty Bergen came up with a way of approximating these points count, which he calls "Adjust-3" and is much easier to use. The standard points count under values Aces and 10s and over values Queens and Jacks (Quacks). Therefore, if the hand contains lots more Aces and 10s, add something and if it contains lots more Queens and Jacks, subtract something. Therefore, for each hand, count up the number of Aces and 10s and count up the number of Queens and Jacks (Quacks).|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


FP|2|AT|
^-
If the number of Aces and 10s is greater by 3 but less than 6 (for example you have 4 Aces 
and 10s and only 1 queen), add (adjust) 1 point to the hand's value.
|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT|
Similarly, if the number of Queens and Jacks exceed the number of Aces and 10s by 3
but less than 6 (say you have 5 Queens and Jacks, and 2 Aces), you subtract (adjust) 1 point.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT|

If the difference is 6+ in either situations add/subtract (adjust) 2.
And finally, Do nothing if the difference is 2 or less.

Doing Adjust-3 is rather most difficult part of Bergen's method. If you don't want to bother, most of the time it won't make a difference. What you can do instead is look at your hand. If there are lots of Queens and Jacks, or lots of Aces and 10s, then you can try to apply Adjust-3, otherwise don't need to bother. However, it is good to remember if Aces+Tens outnumber Quacks by 3 or more (but less than 6) add one point. If Quacks outnumber Aces+tens by 3 or more (but less than 6), subtract one point. Adjust 2 points if one group or the other outnumbers by 6+. Let us practice a few examples and figure out the Starting Points for each hand using the complete Bergen's method.|

PG| ***** 81 ***** |


ht|r|at|
^b@2Based on standard Rule 20 (combined length of two longest suits plus HCP) this hand is an opener. However, based on the implications of Bergen's method on Rule 20 this hand is not an opener. In Bergen's method Rule 20 is the combined length of two longest suits plus ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP. The ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP is the sum of regular HCP, quality suits, Adjust-3, and Dubious Singleton/Doubletons. In another word it is Starting Points without length points.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


AT|

The last hand has 8 ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP (11 HCP less 2 points for Dubious Singleton/Doubletons, and less one point for Adjust-3). Therefore, 4 (Hearts) + 6 (Diamonds) + 8 ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP = 18 and you cannot open it. This conflict only occurs with hands holding many Quacks and Dubious Singleton/Doubleton.|

cp||AT|

Declarer points according to Bergen's method has two parts, 
^c(a). Starting Points and  
^c(b). Additional Points after the fit. 

Therefore, first count the Starting Points then add additional points, according to schedule below-because there is a fit.|

Let us repeat the schedule as it is outlined in Marty Bergen's book. Declarer Points = a + b
^B-- a. Starting points plus,
^B-- b. Declarer Adjustments After a Raise calculated according to the following guideline.
^C-- A Singleton is a two points assets.
^C-- A Doubleton = 0 point
^C-- 2-3 Doubleton = 1 point only
^C-- A Void = 4 points and not 3 as is traditional
^C-- Add 1 point for each trump over 5
^C-- A 4-card side suit (even a weak one) = 1 point|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


at|

Please note that a "^*B5-card quality side suit ^*N" is particularly valuable in declarer's hand after a fit. Such holding, originally contributes 1 point for length and 1 point for quality to the Starting Points calculation. Then, after the fit declarer adds another point for a 4+ card side suit. Therefore, a 5-card side suit of good quality add 3 points to the value of declarer's hand in addition to its Raw HCP.|

Responder bids 4N, and opener bids 5@H (2 Aces, no Q of spades), and responder bids 6@s.  And if you look at the two hands, 6@S is a great contract, with only 26 Raw HCP.  BTW, if you are off a point or so, it really doesn't much matter. The idea is for you to figure out how to upgrade your hands appropriately. The point is that you can bid slams with good fits, even with not that many high card point.|

We already know how to count the Starting Points. The Short-Suit Points are the values assigned to Voids, Doubletons and Singletons in Dummy's hand according to schedule recommended by Marty Bergen.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

Please note that in Bergen's method the dummy hand is the hand with shorter trump suit. Therefore, when the auction is completed after transfers, Michaels cuebids, or unusual NTs the dummy or the hand which goes on the table should upgrade the hand as a declarer and declarer upgrades the hand using the dummy points guideline.|

So it is very simple. You plan to raise partner's suit and that suit most likely becomes trump. You already have counted your Starting Points. Now, your hand as a probable dummy needs to be upgraded. Then, count the Short-Suit points if any and add them to the Starting Points. Now you have an accurate value of your hand and can go further if your Dummy Points warrants.|

Because Marty Bergen adds lots of extra points for length, shortness, and high card quality, the ranges of hands are upgraded when you are deciding how good your hand is. So, using Marty Bergen's methods:|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


AT|

^cOpener
^D@2- a 13-16 Declarer Points hand is a minimum;
- a 17-19 Declarer Points hand is an intermediate
- a 20+ Declarer Points is a maximum.

^cResponder
^D@2- a 6-9 Dummy Points hand is a weak raise;
- a 10-12 Dummy Points hand is considered a limit raise;
- 13+ is a maximum.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, to bid game (in majors), you need at least 26 Total Points, not 25. To bid small slam, you need at least 33 Total Points between the two hands. Again, remember, because Marty Bergen adds many upgrades, you have to upgrade the number of points you need to bid game or slam. For more detailed information on this topic please review Howard's ^*IIntroduction to Constructive Bidding^*N tutorial--|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/baknrw^*N|CP||AT| which you can either from BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or at Howard's web site.|

If you don't play splinters, then you would bid 4@H. The 4@D or 4@H bid is not a shut out. It says, "partner I have a great hand -- 20 or more points." If responder has 13 or more, they should definitely be interested in slam.|

NT|^B@2
On the other hand  1@C-P-1@H-P-3@H is not forcing. It is just invitational. The hand evaluation can be used both in SAYC and 2/1. |

2@H tends to show 4, but can be done with 3 card support on appropriate hands. Typically, you do that when you have 3 to an honor, and shortness somewhere, including a weak doubleton. With @HKQJ, virtually every expert would have no problem raising 1@H to 2@H.|

^B@2^Y@3This is to practice counting Starting points. There are two panels for each quiz. The first panel is the quiz on Starting Points. Choose your answer by clicking the appropriate box or hit the "tell Me" box to see the correct answer. The second panel has the correct count with its components. For your reference all second panels have a summary of Bergen's guideline on how to count Starting Points. 

Quizzes are random and have been selected to cover all parts of Starting Points count. I suggest you do a portion at one time as the number of quizzes may overwhelm you at first.

Please click the forward arrow and good luck.|

{      Practice Declarer Points Count      }
^-
^b@2In the following examples please count the Declarer Points of the hand based on the auction presented. The auction will set whether the hand is Declarer or Dummy. 

Each quiz has four panels. In first you count the Declarer Points. Second panel has the correct answer and how it is calculated with a summary of Bergen's guideline in the left lower corner.

In the third panel you are asked to make a bid based on the information you have collected. Finally, in fourth panel you have the correct bidding and additional comments which generally is by Howard Schutzman, BBO nickname "hondo717" or from Bergen's book ^*Islam Bidding Made Easier^*N. Thus, it is a double delight-learning to evaluate your hand using Bergen's method and learning the proper bidding.

Please try again if you have not answered the quiz correctly on the first try. You always can bypass the quiz by clicking the "Tell Me" box. |

^-
^b@2In the following examples please count the Dummy Points of the hand based on the auction presented. The auction will set whether the hand is Declarer or Dummy. 

Each quiz has four panels. In first you count the Dummy Points. Second panel has the correct answer and how it is calculated with a summary of Bergen's guideline in the left lower corner.

In the third panel you are asked to make a bid based on the information you have collected. Finally, in fourth panel you have the correct bidding and additional comments which generally is by Howard Schutzman, BBO nickname "hondo717" or from Bergen's book ^*Islam Bidding Made Easier^*N. Thus, it is a double delight-learning to evaluate your hand using Bergen's method and learning the proper bidding.

Please try again if you have not answered the quiz correctly on the first try. You always can bypass the quiz by clicking the "Tell Me" box. |

However, it does not have to. Sometimes you can do it with good 3 card heart support (at least one high honor -- A, K, or Q -- or 2 honors), if your hand is likely to be better in a suit contract. Often this means you have shortness somewhere, particularly in spades. This hand is a perfect 2@H raise, and will be more encouraging to partner than rebidding your suit or bidding NT.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

{    Navigation USING YOUR KEYBOARD    }
