^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss when it is good to sacrifice, and when not. For the sake of this discussion, assume the  opponents have bid a makable major suit game, and they are going to double your sacrifice.|

At equal vulnerability, assuming the opponents make game, down 2 is a good sacrifice, down 3 is not. For example, non-vulnerable, down 2 is minus 300, and game is 420. And if we are both vulnerable, down 2 is minus 500, and they are plus 620. Down 3, not vulnerable, is not terrible, 500 vs. 420. On the other hand, down 3 vulnerable is not good, 800 vs. 620.|

If you are not vulnerable and they are vulnerable, it is ok to go down 3, 500 vs. 620.|

If you are vulnerable and the opponents are not, it is almost never right to sacrifice. They have to be making the hand, and you can only be down 1 (200 vs. 420).|

In summary, the best time to sacrifice is when you are not vulnerable and they are. I would also occasionally consider a sacrifice if both are not vulnerable, particularly if you think there is a chance that you might even make the contract (for example, when both sides have fits in 2 suits). However it is rarely right to sacrifice when you are vulnerable, even if the opponents are also vulnerable.|
