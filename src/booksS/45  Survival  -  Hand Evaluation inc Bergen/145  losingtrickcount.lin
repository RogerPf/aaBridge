We only look at the first three cards. Therefore, the maximum losers in one suit is 3 if the first three cards are not Ace, King and Queen. |

cq||hf|l|lb|*mHow many losers do you count in diamonds?^1~2~3~0^3|ht|k|at|^j@2
We only look at the first three cards. Therefore, the maximum losers in one suit is 3 regardless of its length and as long as none of the first three cards are Ace, King and Queen. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


ht|o|at|^B@2Only consider the first three cards in any suit to count the losers in that suit. There can be no more than three losers in each suit. So the hand has only 9 loser. Also please note that the more distributional a hand is the less losers it has.|

Next is how Howard works with the Losing Trick Count.|

qx||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I am not a huge fan of Losing Trick Count, but it has its place. Let me summarize the mechanics first.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT|

Basically, every suit has up to three losers in it. So if you have three plus small, your suit has three losers. With an A, K, or Q, you eliminate a loser.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|

A Qxx suit and any three plus card suit headed by the Queen, King, or Ace has only two losers. Suit holdings such as AQx, or KQx, or AKx has one loser.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|

Two-card suits such as Qx or worse have two losers. There is only one loser in suits such as Ax or Kx. AK has no losers. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|

A one card suit has one loser unless it is a singleton Ace.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT| 

Each hand can have a maximum of 12 losers (3 losers in each suit). So, the combined partnership can have a maximum of 24 losers. If you take the combined losers in both hands, and subtract from 24, that is how many tricks your side should be able to take. For example, if the partnership had seven loser hands, 24 - (7 x 2) = 10, the side could make 4 because making 4 is 10 tricks.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|

That is the essence of losing trick count, take the combined losers between the 2 hands, subtract from 24 and that tells you how many tricks you can take. The question is, how do you figure out how many losers partner has. There are some rules of thumb.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|

A minimum opening hand tends to be 7 losers, a medium hand tends to be six losers and, a maximum hand tends to have five losers. A 2C hand is usually 4 losers or less. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

Similarly, minimum responder hand (6-9) has nine losers, a medium responder hand (10-12) has eight losers.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT| 

Having said all that, I don't use LTC to figure out how high we should bid. I like LOTT much better. But here is where I sometimes use LTC.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|| 
%%%
qx||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|One very good use is to only open 2C if you have no more than a 4 loser hand. Unless you have 22 or more balanced, in which case you open 2C and rebid 2N. But generally speaking, on borderline 2C hands, LTC is a good guideline. When I am deciding how good my hand is (for example, is it worth a reverse?), I might use LTC.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|

I use LTC where I am not sure whether or not to open 2C. I won't consider to open unless (with other criteria) the hand has four losers or less.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT| 

When trying to decide whether to reverse, I need to have a six loser hand, otherwise not a reverse. Similarly, when deciding whether or not to jump shift, (for example, 1C-1H-2S), I like to have a five loser hand.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNext is a part from Howard's "Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding" lessons where three hand evaluation methods (one is Losing Trick Count) is compared. You can review the five lessons either from his web site at|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT| in the "Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding" or from BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT|.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|You may have learned all these complicated bidding rules, but their only purpose is to help you fulfill the following simple objectives.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cP||at|^-


Non-slam auctions have only 2 simple objectives:

1. Bid game if possible, otherwise stay as low as you can.

2. Find a good strain (trump suit or NT).

During the auction, both partners should always be thinking about whether it is still possible to bid game. For example, if your partner opens and you, as responder, have a maximum (12+) hand, you should bid game. Similarly, if you open with a maximum (18+ with traditional count and 20+ with Bergen's count) and get any response from partner, you should bid game. |

The correct answer is 11 losers. Let us go through each suit. There are no top honors. There are 3 losers in Spades. There are only 2 losers in Hearts. And there are 3 losers each in Clubs and diamonds. We count only three losers in each suit.|

There are 8 losers. Remember we only count the first three cards in any suit. In spades we have one loser (Ace and King count as winners). In hearts we have three losers (the jack is not a winner). We have three losers in clubs. In diamonds there is just one loser in diamonds (King and Queen count as winners), remember that the fourth card in the suit does not count.|

Total = 6 losers. 
Only counting the first three cards, we have:
one loser in spades, 
one in hearts (the queen will fall under a higher honor and so counts as a loser),
three in clubs,
and one in diamonds.|

This hand has 4 losers-one in each suit. Please note that HCP and shape are the two important factors determining the number of losers in a hand. The more unbalanced a hand, the smaller the number of losers; and the more points in a hand, the smaller the number of losers.|
