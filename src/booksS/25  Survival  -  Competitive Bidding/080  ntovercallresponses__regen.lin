cp||at|They double with the other 2 suits and an opener. It is rare that you have a 15-18 balanced hand after both opponents have bid. And even if you do, partner has to have a very weak hand since the opponents have shown they have at least around 20 HCP between them.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bGenerally you do not wish to overcall  when the opponents have bid to the two level or higher. They most likely have most of the strength. NT overcall, however, after a weak 2 or a weak 3 opening is an exception. Overcalling 2N after a weak 2 or overcalling 3N after a weak 3 opening is usually done with 15-18 points and good stopper in the opening suit like we have here. With this hand you should bid 2N.
