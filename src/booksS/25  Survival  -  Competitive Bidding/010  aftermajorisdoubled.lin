This short synopsis is based on "Raises in Competition" lesson by ^*BHoward Schutzman^*N, (BBO nickname hondo717"). The link to the original lesson is |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/3w6z9w^*N|CP||AT|.

As part of the Survival Kit group this is a stripped down version. It is what you need in a pinch. However, you probably would like to review Howard's lesson in its entirety and further you probably should review "How to Compete After Your RHO Doubles" a voice lesson by Marty Bergen. Get more on that lesson from this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link. 

In this synopsis, unless clearly indicated consider the information as told by Howard. To start the presentation please click forward arrow.

^-{    Bidding After 1 of a Major Opening is Doubled    }
^-|CP||FP||CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Several important points I like to emphasize. First, conventions such as 2/1 game forcing, 1NT forcing, Jacoby 2NT, and inverted minors all should be off after an opponent's takeout double. And finally Bergen Raises are off after competition (unless you agree otherwise).|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

First, let me explain what is standard and played by most people. You need to learn it if you are going to play with unfamiliar partners. Afterward, I will outline the way I play it.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

In what is standard, bids at the 1-level over a takeout double (e.g. 1@h-x-1@s) show the same thing as if there were not a takeout double. They show at least a 4-card suit and at least 6 points. They have no upper limit in terms of either HCP or the number of cards in the suit bid. And they are forcing. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

However, bids at the 2-level (e.g. 1@h-x-2@C) are weak. They show less than 10 points and a 5+ card suit. They are not forcing. If you have 10 points and a suit that you must bid at the 2-level, then you redouble. Having said that, many players screw it up and think new suits are always forcing whether responder bids at the 1-level or 2-level (e.g. many players mistakenly think 1@h-X-2@C is forcing, even though it should be weak and is definitely not forcing).|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

I personally find this rather confusing. So I play that if you don't redouble or bid Jordan 2N over a takeout double you can't have 10 points. Therefore, after a double, new suits by responder are not forcing, whether or not they are at the 1-level. I think my style is a lot simpler and easier to play than what is played by most. Nevertheless, you need learn that style if you want to play with unfamiliar partners. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In my style, on the other hand, a new bid by responder after a takeout double shows less than 10 points. For example 1@H-X-1@S or 1@H-X-2@C are less than 10 points—keep that in mind. For ease of explanation let us divide the responder's hand in two categories:|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


hT|g|AT|^CA. Hands with 6-9 points.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


hT|g|AT|^CA. Hands with 6-9 points.
^cB. Hands with 10+ points.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

In category A—with 6-9 and support for partner's suit you bid based on the Law of Total tricks |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/087z9w^*N|CP||AT|.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

Bid 2 with 3-card support (just like after an overcall).|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

Bid 3 with 4-card support and less than a limit raise. In competition you want to play weak jump raises. Remember the Law of Total Tricks is your friend :).|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

Bid 4 with 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|

In category B—
^cREDOUBLE with 10+ points and less than 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

^cREDOUBLE with 10+ points and with 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

^cBid 2NT (Jordan 2NT) with 4-card support and limit raise or better (10+).|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|

^B@2Some experts recommend bidding redouble with 10 points holding less than 3-card support and bid 2NT with 3+ card support and limit raise or better. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

Finally, another important note is the 1@H/1@S-double-1N. In this auction 1NT promises 8-11.|

Let us look at some examples for 1 of a major followed by take out double. |

Ignore the double and bid 2@H as you would do in a constructive bidding. With 6-9 and support for partner's suit you bid based on the Law of Total tricks. Bid 2 with 3-card support (just like after an overcall). And don't even think bidding 1@S -:).

2NT is the correct bid. With a B category hand (10+ points) and 4-card support you should bid 2N (Jor^*Bd^*Nan 2NT). There is no upper limit for Jordan 2N. Marty Bergen says, "You can tell the difference between Jacoby 2N and Jordan 2N is that Jordan has ^*BD^*N.

Bid 2@D. Many players think the auction 1@H-X-2@D promises 10 points in responder's hand. That is absolutely incorrect. If you have 10 points, you redouble. Therefore, any suit bids show less than 10 points and a suit worth mentioning.
