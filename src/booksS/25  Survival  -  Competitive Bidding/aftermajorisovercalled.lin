This short synopsis is based on "Raises in Competition" lesson by ^*BHoward Schutzman^*N, (BBO nickname hondo717"). The link to the original lesson is |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/3w6z9w^*N|CP||AT|.

As part of the Survival Kit group this is a stripped down version. It is what you need in a pinch. However, you probably would like to review Howard's lesson in its entirety.

^-{    How to Bid after an Overcall - Major Suit Opening    }
^-|CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The important thing to remember is there are now 2 extra bids available to you after your RHO overcalls partner's one of a majors opening. Many bids keep their meaning as if there were no overcall. And the meaning of a few is changed. The two added bids are:|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

One is |cp|8|at|double;|cp||at| the other is a |cp|8|at|cue bid|cp||at| of their suit.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Double as you all know is negative, showing the unbid major. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

A cue bid is a limit+ raise of partner's suit. With minor differences the criteria for cue bid are the same for majors and minors. Because a cue bid is a strong bid, now a jump raise is a weak bid.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT| So. the auction below:|HT|l|cs|6|at| 
{|ia|,1s2c3s|at|}|HT|m|cs||at|^m@2^Z@33@S does not show a limit raise. If you have a limit raise you bid 3@C. For a limit raise you needs 10+ dummy points. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


ht|o|AT|^B@2
 
Bergen raises are off if you play them unless you have prior agreement with partner and they are alertable. Next we illustrate various options. |

^-{    General Approach after an Overcall - Contin.   }
^-|CS||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|With 10+ points and support for the major bid by the partner you have some choices.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|
With 4-card support you always cue bid.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

With 3-card support it is a matter of style. I think more people than not play they can cue bid if they have 10+ points and 3-card support as well as 4-card support. I am  not one of  those people (surprise, lol).|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|

I think knowing you have a 9-card fit is very important. With the same high cards, a hand with a 9-card fit will usually play a trick better than an 8-card fit. The 9th trump is crucial, because you have more trump available after drawing trump. So, I do not like to cue bid with 3-card support, and will usually bid a new suit first and raise later. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

I play a cue bid promises 4-card support. Occasionally I get stuck and have to lie. But I really like it promising 4-card support. However, If you want to play cue bid shows 3-card support as well, that is fine. ^*BBTW, in competition, New suits by responder are still forcing.^*N|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|In this auction there is only one unbid major suit—spades—so that is what the suit responder's Negative Double promises. Responder needs about 8+ points to double here. As you note, responder has diamond length in this example—he doesn't have to for a double—and his double says nothing about diamonds.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%% 2NT showing limit raise

^-{    2NT to Show Limit Raise    }
^-|CS||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss a couple of advanced conventions. One is the use of 2N to show a limit raise. If you play that, then both 2N and a cue bid show a limit raise—of course then you give up 2N as a natural bid. According to this style, then the cheaper of 2N and the cue shows 3-card limit raise and the higher shows 4-cards. It would be better understood if we show you a few examples.|

^b@2The correct bid is 3@C. Now you bid 3@C (higher between 2N and 3@C) to show 4-card raise. 2N would show a 3-card raise.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|A negative  double is not recommended. I think a VERY important  bidding principle is, you must show support with support immediately with 4+ card support. If you do not raise partner immediately, you cannot have 4-card support. I don't care if you are 7-4, raise partner, don't bid your 7-card suit. That might be a slight exaggeration, but I am trying to make an important point here.|
