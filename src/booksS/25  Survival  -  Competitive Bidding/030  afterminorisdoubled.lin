This short synopsis is based on "Raises in Competition" lesson by ^*BHoward Schutzman^*N, (BBO nickname hondo717"). The link to the original lesson is |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/3w6z9w^*N|CP||AT|.

As part of the Survival Kit group this is a stripped down version. It is what you need in a pinch. However, you probably would like to review Howard's lesson in its entirety and further you probably should review "How to Compete After Your RHO Doubles" a voice lesson by Marty Bergen. Get more on that lesson from this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link. 

In this synopsis, unless clearly indicated consider the information as told by Howard. To start the presentation please click forward arrow.

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Several important points I like to emphasize. First, conventions such as 2/1 game forcing, 1NT forcing, Jacoby 2NT, and inverted minors all should be off after an opponent's takeout double.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

First, let me explain what is standard and played by most people. You need to learn it if you are going to play with unfamiliar partners. Afterward, I will outline the way I play it.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

In what is standard, bids at the 1-level over a takeout double (e.g. 1@D-x-1@H) show the same thing as if there were not a takeout double. They show at least a 4-card suit and at least 6 points. They have no upper limit in terms of either HCP or the number of cards in the suit bid. And they are forcing. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

However, bids at the 2-level (e.g. 1@D-x-2@C) are weak. They show less than 10 points and a 5+ card suit. They are not forcing. If you have 10 points and a suit that you must bid at the 2-level, then you redouble. Having said that, many players screw it up and think new suits are always forcing whether responder bids at the 1-level or 2-level (e.g. many players mistakenly think 1@D-X-2@C is forcing, even though it should be weak and is definitely not forcing).|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

I personally find this rather confusing. So I play that if you don't redouble or bid Jordan 2N over a takeout double you can't have 10 points. Therefore, after a double, new suits by responder are not forcing, whether or not they are at the 1-level. I think my style is a lot simpler and easier to play than what is played by most. Nevertheless, you need learn that style if you want to play with unfamiliar partners.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

In my approach, if you have a nice major bid it. But remember the doubler tends to promises at least one of the majors, so don't bid a weak suit. You only need 4 cards, but you should have at least a couple of honors. And of course the redouble rule applies, so if you bid 1 of a major you have less than 10 points.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Here again redouble is the only way to show 10 points. You bid 1N with 8-11 points and you should bid 2N with five card support and 10+ points. Weak jump shifts and weak raises are highly recommended. We can get a better understanding of the bidding with the following examples.|

ht|k|at|^B@2
Bid Redouble or Jordan 2NT. Generally speaking, you should not bid Jordan 2N over 1 of a minor with a nice 4-card major or just about any 5-card major. But Jordan 2N is certainly a possible bid.|ht|e|

Redouble is the best bid. You have nice spades which you can show later. Jordan 2N takes up too much room and may not allow you to show your spades.
