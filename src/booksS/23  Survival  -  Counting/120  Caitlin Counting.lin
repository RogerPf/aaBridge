MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen definitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen. 
If you don't have aaBridge yet, here is a link for the download:

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2Caitlin:    The Basics

We will look at a variety of issues which are involved with counting.
Bridge is a game of counting so let’s break it down as to when you count:

a) When declarer does not have what we call a ‘cold’ contract 
(i.e. more losers than s/he can afford to make the contract), counting may help. 
We will see examples where this is true.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

b) Defenders count declarer’s hand. 
If, for example West opens 1NT and the contract becomes 3NT, and declarer has shown 17 HCPs (High Card Points)
and declarer must have the missing @hAce, as partner has signalled s/he doesn't like hearts.. 
South now knows that partner must have say the @cK (as declarer can’t have the @hAce and the missing @cK).
When "in", you should feel free to lay down the @cAce from @cAQJ as partner should have the Club King... 
In doing so, you may defeat the contract if you get your tricks in time.
(see example hands later)|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

c) Defenders give count to one another, but when? 
When on defense, and your partner leads, you give attitude 
(or plan to take the trick/drive out declarer's higher honor with "lowest of touching equals") 
But when declarer plays a suit, give count, thus traditionally high-low with an even number of cards (8^*u6^*n52), 
and low-high with an odd number of cards (J3^*u2^*n).
What if the suit has been played one round?  Now we are giving remainder count. 
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||
cp|2|ht|b|at|^b@2Thus with 852 remaining in the above example, we now play low-high, the 2; 
and with J3 left from the above J32, we play the Jack if it makes sense to do so.
Remember it is very important to give your partner count on defense, but you must be the judge. 
If giving count or attitude in a specific situation only helps declarer, LIE!|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

More Tips for Counting:

a) The bidding at the table gives enormous help. For example, if an opponent, say East, opens a weak 2@s; 
and North-South land up in 4@h -- 
declarer already starts with a good count on the opponents cards, knowing one opponent has six in a suit.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

b) The lead is also a key for declarer. Say you are in 4@s, and your opponent, who passed in first seat, leads the @hAK. 
Later s/he shows up with the Club King. 
There is no way s/he can have the missing @dK or s/he would have opened the bidding.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |

Mike Lawrence, a member of BBO, wrote: ‘How to Read Your Opponents’Cards’ many years ago and has two CDs on counting: 
‘Counting at Bridge’ and ‘Counting at Bridge 2’. 
I highly recommend you consider purchasing Lawrence’s first CD, with software by BBO’s founder, Fred Gitelman, from the BBO ‘Online Store’.

pc|dt|at|Caitlin: Bidding:   The bidding could be better! 
The 5@s bid, with 4NT as RKC Blackwood shows 2 controls — the two Aces and the Queen of hearts.. 
Even though South is heading toward notrump, you respond to 4NT based on the last suit bid, 
thus 5@s showing two Aces and the @HQ.|

at|Caitlin: What is your plan?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
We want to find the @cJ for 4 club tricks..
So we are going to cash our top winners outside the club suit
(3 spades, 3 hearts and 3 diamonds)
As you cash your winners, we count ^*uone^*n opponents hand (say West here)

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|
We know that West’s shape is 1=2=6=4. 
(West still holds 4 clubs while he discarded all his diamonds)
While West has four clubs => East only two 
This makes it twice as likely that West has the club Jack|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |

and he does.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||up|36|
at|Once declarer has determined that West started with 4 clubs, the hand is cold regardless of who has the CJ. Declarer cashes the @CA and @CQ watching the clubs that East plays. 
If the @CJ drops, then the CK and C10 are both good. 
If, as on this layout, the @CJ does not drop, then declarer leads a low club to take the marked finesse against
West, who is known to have the @CJ and another club.
