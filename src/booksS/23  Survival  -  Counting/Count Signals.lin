%%%%% Count Signals
qx|A6|BT||tu||HT|a|va|4|cs|1|cp|4|fp|3|at|^-{    Count Signals - Standard    }
^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2Knowing the counts in a suit is a great tool for the defenders. Giving count signals enables them to achieve this knowledge. When you and your partner know Declarer's count in a suit (based on the bidding), it is not necessary to give count to each other. Giving count would only help Declarer (if she/he pays attention).|
PG| ***** 0 ***** |


AT|

Like attitude signals it involves using your spot cards (2 through 9). Standard count signals most often are given when either Declarer leads a suit, or a suit is led from Dummy. In such cases, attitude does NOT apply. When partner leads a suit your first priority is to give attitude but on the second round you are giving count to your partner. This synopsis explains only the Standard count signals.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT| Standard count is to play your:|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|
|CS|1|CP|4|fp|2|at|^-
{  lowest card from 3 or 5 cards;  }|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

{  your second-highest from 4 cards followed by the lowest (unless you think   
it is too valuable-in which case you play your 3rd-highest);  }
|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|m|AT|
{      your top card from a doubleton (unless you feel it is too valuable        
often a 10 or higher doubleton is not played first round).}
^-|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


ht|o|fp||cp||AT|
Giving count is vital when Declarer is attacking a side suit (perhaps in dummy) and you or your partner must figure out how many rounds to duck your Ace (to exhaust Declarer of cards in that suit) to cut the link between Declarer and Dummy.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

If your partner has bid a suit and you have supported that suit, you will usually have 3 or 4 cards in the suit. If partner leads a high honor, your first card would normally be attitude (high if you have the equal honor). If the equal honor is visible in dummy (e.g., partner leads Ace from Akxxx[x] and Qxx is in dummy), your first card should be count (high from 4, low from 3 cards). |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

If the opponents are playing at the 5 or the 6 level, lead the KING (not the Ace) from AK combinations. This asks partner to give count in the suit (so you know whether or not your Ace will cash). Particularly when the queen shows up in dummy, your partner should know that attitude is irrelevant and count is what matters.|

HT|a|va|4|cs|1|cp|4|fp|3|at|^-{    Count Signals - Standard    }
^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2When you lead the Ace of a suit you bid (and partner did not support), and K Q x (x) shows up in dummy, partner gives count. Many times, that will tell you, Lavinthal, or not you can give partner a ruff.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

Obviously, you would not give count if it sacrifices an unnecessarily high card (e.g., J 10 2). Go ahead and play the 2 on the  first round). Your partner can figure it out.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

Next are examples and a board to practice a hold up using count signals.|

PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT| presumably showing the King |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT| and dummy plays the two of spades.|PC|s2|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT| You would like to tell partner that you can trump the third round. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


lb|*cWhich card would you play?^^s8^s86h2|NT|^B@2
You would play the 8 on the first round (high from doubleton). |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


PC|s8S5|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And the 6 on the King to show a doubleton. |PC|SKs3S6S9|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT| Partner would then presumably lead a third round for you to trump. |PC|s7s4h2st|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You may be wondering, “How does partner know you have a doubleton, as opposed to that you are making an attitude signal that you have the Queen?” The answer is that partner does not know, but does not really care. The 8 followed by the 6 is encouraging in any case. Whether it is a doubleton or it shows the Queen does not really matter. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |

Let's change this example around a little bit.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%sqt
pn|,Partner,Dummy,You,|ST||HA||sk|e|MD|1,SAKj97,S432,|rh||AH|Board X2|MB|4hppp|NT|^B@2
Again you are defending a 4@H contract. Partner leads the Ace.|PC|SA|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT| Dummy plays the two,|PC|S2|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT| you play the @s5,|md|0st,0,0,s5|PC|S5|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT| and the declarer plays the ten. |PC|st|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now partner knows that you don't have a doubleton nor the @SQ because @S5 was the lowest card as he can see @S4 3 2 in the dummy. You would have encouraged with higher card if you had the @SQ. Therefore, you presumably started with 3 small spades. Partner now can make an intelligent decision as to whether or not to continue the suit.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, if the rest of his spades holding is what we see now|sk|w|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT| he will continue the suit, because he knows that declarer started with doubleton queen. He can see 8 spades between his hand and dummy and you have shown 3. That makes a total of 11 spades that are accounted for, leaving 2 for declarer. Therefore, partner knows it is safe to cash the King of spades, because the Queen will drop. |md|0sq,0,0,s68|sk||

On the other hand, if partner held this hand, after you played the five he probably would not want to continue the suit. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


PC|sas2s5s9|sk||
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Based on your signal (the lowest spade card), he knows that declarer holds 3 spades to the Queen. He has 4, dummy has 3, and you showed 3.|MD|0sqt,0,0,s86|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT| If he chose to cash the King at trick 2, then he would set up declarer's Queen. So he would switch to another suit and hope that you will get in at some point to lead a spade through declarer's Queen. This will allow your side to score 3 spade tricks instead of the 2 you would get if partner continued spades at trick 2.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How do you know whether a partner's signal is count or attitude? The most general rule is that you should signal attitude unless it is obvious that you are signaling count. Even in the earlier example where you held a doubleton, and played high-low (8 then 6) to show two, that was attitude in a sense. You wanted to encourage partner to play a third round so you could trump the third round. Next, we will look at some examples where it is obvious partner is giving count. |

pn|,Partner,Dummy,You,|ST||HA|Y|sk||MD|1,SAK97,,|rh||AH|Board X4|MB|4hppp|NT|^B@2
Suppose again you are defending a 4@H contract and partner leads the A of spades from the 4-card holding|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|sa|at| and dummy holds the cards as you see above.|md|0,0,SQJ32,0|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner knows that you cannot have the Queen or Jack, since they are in dummy, Signaling attitude provides partner with no additional information, since he knows you have no honors in the suit. Therefore, you might as well signal count.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you are fortunate enough to have a doubleton,|md|0,0,0,s86|pc|s2s8|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT| then partner knows he can give you a ruff. And if you have 3 or 4, then partner can figure out what declarer's holding is.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us look at a few specific examples.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
pn|,Partner,Dummy,You,|ST||HA||sk||MD|1,SAKt9,SqJ3,s86h2|rh||AH|Board X5|MB|4cppp|NT|^B@2
When partner leads the Ace and you play the 8, |PC|SAS3S8|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT| by looking at the dummy partner knows you have either a doubleton and are starting a high-low count signal or you have a singleton 8. In any case, he can play 3 rounds of the suit and give you a ruff, since he knows that if you started with two, declarer started with three. |md|0s542,0,0,0|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|

Next, is another example.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


sk||NT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
pn|,Partner,Dummy,You,|ST||HA|Y|sk||MD|1,SAKt97,SQJ34,s862|rh||AH|Board X6|MB|4hppp|NT|^B@2
When partner leads the Ace, dummy plays @S3, and you play the @S2, |PC|sas3s2|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT| showing 3 cards in the suit.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT| Partner by looking at the dummy and the card you played now knows that declarer started with a singleton, and realizes it would be foolish to try and cash the King, as declarer would ruff and the @SQ and @SJ would both be good. |md|0s5,0,0,0|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |

Next, is one other common situation where count is important. |

pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner,|ST||HA|Y|sk||MD|1,sa87,SKQJT9,|rh||AH|Board X7|MB|4hppp|NT|^B@2
Here dummy has a long suit with ^*Bno outside entries^*N and you hold the Ace and declarer is going to lead a small card to the dummy. You would like to hold up on the ace until declarer has played his last card in the suit. So you need to know how many spades declarer has. If you take your ace before declarer is out, declarer will score four tricks in spades. And if you delay taking your ace more than is required, then declarer will get an extra trick.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have 8 cards between you and dummy. Therefore, partner and declarer have 5 between them. The most common situations are when declarer has three and partner has two, or vice-versa.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, when declarer leads a low card from his hand you play low (not the Ace) and look carefully at what partner plays.|wt|s|md|0s2,0,0,0|PC|s2|wt|w|pc|s7|pc|SK|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A good partner knows this is a classic count situation and will give you count. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner plays high,|md|0,0,0,s5|pc|s5|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT| you can assume he started with two and declarer with three,|MD|0s36,0,0,s4|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT| and, therefore, you must hold up your ace until the third round. Again limiting declarer to two tricks, the minimum number of tricks to which he was entitled.|

The bidding is not of much help but you should be able to beat the contract. Sorry you cannot peek at the other hands. I will add the cards as we go along. Hearts suit would be the battle ground.|

Fourth best from the longest and strongest suit is the correct lead. Now it is critical for you to correctly count out hearts holding for East and South. You started with 5 and dummy with 2.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


md|0,0,0,h7|pc|h7|NT||AT|^B@2
Your partner knows the count signals and is returning the remaining count. That means partner started with 3 hearts-@HK 7 x. Dummy started with 2 hearts-@h8 5. Therefore, declarer started with 3 hearts and two remaining. They are most likely @hQ J 9.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


md|0hq,0,0,0|pc|hq|NT||AT|^B@2
What is going on? Did partner made an error and had @HKJ7 and should have returned the @HJ. Surely had Declarer had the Jack would have played it instead of the @HQ. It is your call now. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |

That was a great false card by the Declarer. Now he can easily make his contract. You never can get back as you have no entry.  And when partner gets back in with @DA and leads his last heart, it will be killed by Declarer's @HJ.|
