========

A standalone (non network) Bridge (Card playing) program in Java with eclipse project included. The interface is based on the BBO (Bridge Base Online) design. It is Intended for novices and those practicing their card evaluation skills. It generates strong hands and lets the user play them.  It includes a hand editor (Drag and drop).  Possible future direction - extended to act as a BBO (offline) hand editor.  -  Any volunteers to do this?  Just fork away. :)
