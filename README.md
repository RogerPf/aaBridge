Go to - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8ErhAQp22E4WjFZTGJwWVVUQ1U - for the .exe or built .jar  (including the latest sources) - - - aaBridge is a standalone (non network) Bridge hand analyzer and player written in Java (swing).  It works well with BBO easily accepting hands for analysis from the site. It is a full 'lin' file (aka 'Bridge Movie') player.  It also includes over 90 bridge tutorials and over 2,350 annotated and commented deals that can be stepped through during study.  When used as a Bridge Playing program it is good for both novices and those practicing their card evaluation skills.  It can generate interesting (difficult) hands and let the user play them. -  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8ErhAQp22E4WjFZTGJwWVVUQ1U
